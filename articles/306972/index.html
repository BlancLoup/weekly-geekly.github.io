  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Digital advertising kills optimists</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, habrovchane!  I have not visited our favorite site for a long time; I gained life experience in order to tell it to you later.  Modern Internet technology to promote products and services is not a panacea for confusion in the head.  I learned this the hard way.  This article for those who blindly believe in the magic of modern technology carries its blood on its altar. <br>  Two and a half months ago, I decided to overcome minimizing the cash gaps in my business by converting many small bids into average ordered orders.  Previously, I did not consider applications whose budget was below 12,000 rubles, and for me it was an insight to how many people were ready to pay 1,500 for minor repairs. <br>  It is not a secret that Moscow is divided by railways and a river into sectors and it makes no sense to take on one application, since profitability depends on the distance of the application from the supplier, the time to which it is necessary to arrive and the time required for work.  If you find yourself in the sector at rush hour, then leave it in a reasonable time is almost impossible.  Consequently, it is necessary to combine the requests for geolocation, hi Yandex maps! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  <b>Head to head - contextual advertising and SSM</b> </h3><br>  It‚Äôs just a fairy tale, but it‚Äôs not done any time soon. After tweaking the girl for three days, I realized that a stone flower wasn‚Äôt coming out and more orders were needed.  Well, more orders mean an advertising campaign on the Internet.  Most want money and in advance.  Particularly smart take at 100%.  What actually represent many of these offices, I will tell at the end. <br>  I borrow a lot of money and start knocking at various agencies.  Here, to me, both marketers and PR managers and designers and optimizers promise, with a wave of a magic wand, to increase the potency of my business and win a new market segment in almost a month. <br>  By the time I had a simple Joomla site and a few half-dead accounts in social networks.  Well, what is not an object to advance?  I turned into one online agency, seemingly clean and with a good reputation.  Made portraits of clients and a user story, flooded them with money for promotion, and everything seemed to start moving uphill.  Applications went and began to take a lot of time for calculation, and the conversion of their orders was a cheap one.  In Yandex, my site has not been highlighted for a week.  I tried to find it on purpose, but it was at the end of the second, then closer to the middle of the third page.  The thing is crap, I thought.  In social networks everything was much more interesting.  It seemed that life was in full swing, the content was laid out, there were a lot of reviews, the group was replenished, but then one account was blocked.  I start correspondence with the agency.  While the point is, my girl brings me 60-70 cents per ruble from a cold call, and thanks for that.  As a result, after a week or more, the agency became bankrupt and withdrew itself, and the live account began to fill up with garbage. <br><br><h4>  After analyzing the experience, I understood the following: </h4><br>  1. Contextual advertising for serious boys with decorated content and it is necessary to fill in the order of hundreds of wooden per month, so that it brings income. <br>  2. It is worth investing in social networks when you have already shot with your product and you need to integrate it into the masses.  They also require a large investment on the team that will be engaged in promotion.  This is an additional tool to facilitate the conversion of applications into orders: <br><ul><li>  Increasing the awareness of the potential audience about the product or service leads to an increase in the degree of trust. </li><li>  The increase in contact speed leads to an increase in applications from warm customers and simplifies their conversion into orders. </li><li>  Interesting content reduces the cost of heating customers. </li><li>  Feedback improves the efficiency of interaction with visitors and the supportability of the product. </li><li>  Formation of an active customer base with subsequent conversion into repeat sales. </li><li>  Analog methods still work well for the age group of 30 years and can pay for themselves. </li></ul><br>  After a short prostration, I began to float with my provider.  For some reason he did not give me access to my site.  A sign fell out that, in accordance with the decision to the containers, there, my website was blocked.  As it turned out later, not only mine.  From the smartphone, I saw them all perfectly.

    <h3>  <b>Hard landing</b> </h3><br>  Almost a month worked in a deep minus, it is necessary to pay off with creditors and pay salaries, there is nothing to do with purchases.  With a grief in half, I calculated, but I was left without a girl who called everyone around.  She was already the fourth since the beginning of the year.  A few days later, two more people who delivered orders would refuse to work with me because of the negatives that fell on them from my pages, but so far I am full of optimism and think what to do next.  All weekend and Monday prolazil on the Internet and imbued with the spirit of the landing page.  I borrow money again and start a new company. <br>  About landing page special sense to tell, I think, no.  I'll tell you better what to pay attention to and how not to get a knife in the back from the creators of such pages.  You can be offered a promotion strategy along with the page, but this is a waste of money, because no one yet knows about your product and the audience‚Äôs reaction to it is not known.  We immediately dismiss and do not clog up our thinking process, we still need it.  I got the impression that only lazy is not engaged in the development of landing pages.  On such a lazy tree, I ran.  Over 4000 I was promised a miracle again.  Looking at the author's page and his portfolio, I thought it was adequate money for the week of work.  Wonders did not wait, they did not work.  On the third day of work, the designer asked for a page layout and content for the design.  I quickly put on a layout, pumped up pictures and backgrounds, sent it to him, and I began to write texts. <br>  In the process of writing, I realized that this was not my destiny and decided to order one more page in parallel, but already for 14,000. There the girl was already sitting on the phone and competently answered questions.  I listened carefully and even sent a beautiful commercial offer. <br>  The first page was half dead.  The layout was taken my one-on-one and the markup by the developer was never right, the elements drove over each other when scaling, and in principle it was impossible to use it.  The second page turned out to be workable, but it had a confusing algorithm, which was different from mine.  The developers simply filled the WordPress template with content, but they could not customize it, or didn‚Äôt want it.  All right, we publish on jinno and we begin the company.  We receive one application from 180 people who have come.  A quick survey reveals that users do not understand where they are. <br>  Need a normal copywriter and designer.  We take a new page for a little more than 25,000 with a copywriter and designer + they will move and host it.  Two pages are better than one, are you !?  The design turned out to be stunning: here are sliders, social networks and even trendy Parallax with lots of unnecessary animation of buttons.  Navigation is simple and clear even for a 70 year old grandmother.  One problem - the texts that will not sell even a roll of toilet paper to a person suffering from diarrhea.  Quote from the page "If you have a problem - it does not matter, we will help!".  Launched and ruled in the process.  Conversion 1 to 75 with their text and 3 to 50 with the agreed text.  The average attendance per day is about 100 users.  The result of my experiment was a payable of about 180,000. Today I worked for the sake of interest about 20 KP from different price segments. <br><br><h3>  <b>Your brain - help alien hands</b> </h3><br>  Most people involved in landing pages and sites up to 20 000 rubles.  selling their hands without a share of creativity does not give any guarantees.  Jam correction and support is made through the rectum or for money.  In this segment, freelancers work, small firms, just freeloaders.  The portfolio of such people may be strangers or made to order by more experienced colleagues.  If you have a small amount of money and time, make everything yourself from the templates or find a trusted designer and copywriter.  There is no sense to pay money for a landing page that does not fulfill its purpose.  Working Landing with the design of your thoughts in a commercial form starts from 40 000. Add the cost of promotion, hosting, refinement and you will receive your advertising budget. <br>  Expensively, I was given an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe need for serious preparation for an advertising campaign and an understanding that no one would conduct it for me.  For a serious event you need to conclude a contract without fail. <br>  Before embarking on all the serious, choose three key features of your product and project them to the needs of your audience. <br>  Based on the projection formulate USP <br>  Based on the audience data, choose the best target information channel to shoot with your product.  At this stage, it is advisable to get marketing advice and enlist the support of popular bloggers. <br>  Go to the copywriter and make out thoughts in a commercial form. <br>  Debug texts on focus group. <br>  Now you can turn to designers and coders. <br>  While they are doing the work, buy out the domain names and hosting. <br>  Start a company before the availability of your product page, because it takes time for search engine indexes to be updated.  It should be promoted by people who understand that they are not moving the page itself, but your UTP. <br>  <b>PS</b> : Modern technology is an old tool in a new guise.  As before, they need to be able to work ./&gt; </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306972/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306972/</a></p>
