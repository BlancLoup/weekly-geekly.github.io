  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ministry of Communications and Telecommunications is responsible for the president</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  By the beginning of the July <a href="http://president.yandex.ru/">Internet conference of</a> Putin, more than 175,000 questions had been received by Yandex and BBC.  1,547 of them were related to the topic ‚ÄúInformation Technologies and Communication‚Äù.  In fulfillment of the presidential instruction, the Ministry of Communications and Communications prepared and <a href="http://www.minsvyaz.ru/site.shtml%3Fid%3D4003">published answers</a> to the main of these questions. <br><br>  Some interesting things reminded of themselves with the appearance of the responses of the Ministry.  For example, it was said that Microsoft, within the framework of the State Security Program, opened the source code for Windows 2000 operating systems (CE, XP, and also Windows Server 2003) to Russia ‚Äî our country was the first to receive these codes.  According to the Ministry, FAPSI, the State Technical Commission, the Federal Security Service, the State Construction Committee and the Ministry of Communications of Russia have access to them.  It is possible that the country will create its own operating system - this was the answer to the question of the emergence of the Russian Gates with the new OS. <br><br>  According to the Ministry of Information Technologies, when it becomes profitable for all participants in the telecommunications market, the country will switch to a free, unlimited internet.  In addition, it was noted that within the framework of the priority national project ‚ÄúEducation‚Äù, it is planned to provide unlimited access to the Network (at a speed of 128 Kbps) to 52,940 schools in all regions of Russia.  Recall, the tender for the Internet schools was <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/lenta/735/">won</a> by RTKomm.

      In response to the outrage of one of the Internet users, caused by the ‚Äúdeliberate delaying by officials of the creation and launch of technoparks‚Äù, the Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications has given the chronology of the project decisions.  According to the information, work in this direction is in full swing: on April 17, 2006, construction of an IT park in St. Petersburg was opened, and on June 20, a resolution was approved to establish technology parks in the territory of the Chernogolovka municipal unit and the Dmitrovsky district of the Moscow region. <br><br>  In the established technology parks, it was said, special attention will be paid to the nano-and bio-information technology industries. <br><br>  Not once mentioned and other measures of state assistance to the IT industry.  In addition to the project to create technology parks, a special entrepreneurial regime was introduced for software exporters and a system of venture financing for the industry is being formed. <br><br>  Information on employment in the ICT industry is given to the issue of the leakage of IT personnel abroad: the number of employees in it is about 1.2% of the total number of people employed in the Russian Federation (87,500.3).  There is a 50% annual growth in demand for IT professionals in the country, and these rates will continue until 2010.  By the way, in each of the technology parks it is planned to create an average of 10 thousand jobs, which will ensure the employment of university graduates, as well as specialists released during the conversion of defense industries. <br><br>  Some answers of the Ministry of Communications and Telecommunications, however, give rise to the thought that the questions of Internet users were not read very carefully.  For example, the question started with the wording received an answer: <i>‚Äúunder the conditions of the totalitarian regime, high technologies are not required, it is enough to shoot a part of violators - this is much more effective for control‚Äù</i> .  In it, the ministry, among other things, reports that the IT industry in the Russian Federation is developing at a rate of over 30% per year, but in the next paragraph, for some reason, it names only 20% of the annual growth of the industry - an annoying loss of 10%. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4383/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4383/</a></p>
