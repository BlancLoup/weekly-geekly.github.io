If you call the number + 7-914-450-7126, you can listen to weather reports.  Reads the robot, in Russian and English.  Works in the daytime.  The difference in time with Moscow at Cheats is +6 hours. <br><br>  Meteorological information is taken from the radio at 126.4 MHz.  And then simply transferred to a mobile phone that is configured to automatically receive a call.  There are no restrictions on the duration of the connection.  Multichannels, however, also: at one time only one incoming call. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For reference

      <i>ATIS (English Automatic Terminal Information Service, ATIS) is an automated system that constantly transmits information on the meteorological situation in the aerodrome area and operational information necessary for the aircraft crew to plan departure and arrival</i>  <i>The abbreviation ATIS in Russia is officially adopted and is used in all regulatory documents.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The use of ATIS allows reducing the load on the dispatcher, making it unnecessary to transfer the same information to each new crew in his area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The transfer of information is carried out at a specific frequency for each aerodrome, which can be specified using navigation collections.</i>  <i>Information is transmitted continuously and cyclically, that is, a message, usually lasting no more than a minute, is repeated again and again.</i>  <i>In international airports ATIS broadcasts in both Russian and English, sometimes at different frequencies.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>ATIS reports are regular and special.</i>  <i>The next reports are formed in 00 minutes and 30 minutes of each hour.</i>  <i>Special reports are formed when there are significant changes in weather conditions (the term ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù implies passing through certain criteria) or a change in navigation information that affects flight operations in the vicinity of the aerodrome.</i>  <i>When forming the ATIS report, each new message is assigned an alphabetic index.</i>  <i>This code (the letter of the Latin alphabet) is transmitted at the beginning and at the end of each message by means of a phonetic alphabet (for example, A - Alpha, B - Bravo, C - Charlie, etc.).</i>  <i>When contacting the dispatcher, the crew indicates the code of the last listened ATIS message.</i>  <i>Thus, the dispatcher always knows if the pilot has the latest information and, if necessary, asks him to listen to a new message.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/411/5b0/e17/4115b0e17a2bd73185cfd377f8ca8e62.jpg"><br><br>  The technical implementation of our homemade is simple.  To receive the radio signal, we used the R-870M receiver.  The Nokia 1616 phone is looking into the GSM network. There is an improvised matching device between them.  Once a day for two hours the timer turns on and recharges the cell phone's battery with a standard charger.  For three years there were no problems with food.  Power backup is not provided. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed7/aae/be0/ed7aaebe0c3737371cd5085706bfe949.jpg"><br>  The receiver connects to the phone through a galvanic isolation.  So that the mobile phone knows that the headset is connected, and not just a headset, there is a 5.1 kŒ© resistor.  The wire with a four-pin plug is taken from the standard headset.  The second resistor attenuates the signal from the receiver's "SPEAKER" output.  It is better to use the "TELEPHONE" output, but it does not work on our receiver. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c6e/918/7a8/c6e9187a8f3896b4e23ffdd2cb775824.jpg"><br>  We bought the receiver R-870M for some sorting out of the airframe.  At first, hesitated a little; there was a choice to take him or receiver Cormorant.  We stopped at this - at Baklan the power supply is inconvenient - 28 volts, and ours are powered by 220 V. <br><br>  The antenna is used whip on a magnetic base, forty centimeters long.  Takes well even indoors, so just put it on the windowsill.  It has been there for three years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5e9/026/3ce/5e90263ce4d4d7fe7a644478f84e37e4.jpg"><br>  If the matching device is assembled correctly, when the plug is connected, a headset image appears on the screen.  After that, in the properties of the accessory you need to enable automatic call acceptance.  No settings are required anymore, well, except maybe just turn down the volume of the call melody to the minimum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/84a/f93/2d7/84af932d7fbb9e90f3d89ef9e19a4112.jpg"><br>  The matching device is assembled on a piece of foiled PCB.  Contact tracks are simply cut by a chisel.  Transformer taken from the bald, which is found. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fca/4e6/a53/fca4e6a53d5824f98fd83d0c91a1ce22.jpg"><br>  The charger turns on once a day for a couple of hours.  This is quite enough to fully charge the battery.  Timer bought at the store electricians.  It is programmed simply, it works stably. <br><br>  The second service ‚ÄúVOLMET by phone‚Äù works on the exact same element base.  Information is taken from a different frequency.  There the reports are shorter, but for several cities.  A person reads in two languages.  Mode of operation around the clock.  The sound quality is not very good - reports are written, it seems, on a magnetic tape.  Phone VOLMET + 7-914-804-9361. <br><br>  The cost of a call is equal to a regular call to the mobile phone of the MTS operator. <br><br>  And what similar services are there in your city? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150834/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150834/</a></p>
