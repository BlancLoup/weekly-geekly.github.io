  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social network design issues</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What's wrong?  Everyone is already tired of social networks?  Well, well, it's not about them, but about the next epochal invention after the hypertext vector fidonet, simply, humanity has not yet come up with a name for it.  Well, let's talk a bit about Singularity and Trash Humanism <br><br>  Let's start with a review of existing solutions.  Based on the premise that we here in Russia should envy everyone there - we will begin to criticize Twitter, Facebook and Google Wave.  So, what does not suit me twitter ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There, on the right, there is a feature called Trending, where the type displays global trends in discussions.  So, these beetles still do not add Russia to it, they added some Mexico, and Russia took it out.  ‚ÄúDon't see your location?  We're working on it ‚Äù- yeah, we‚Äôve been working on adding lines for half a year.  But the design on any dates do not forget to change.  Facebook I decided not to scold, I praise him.  It is very flexible that any phrase on the wall of a person can be discussed.  Zukenberg is right that he decided to zohavat Facebook all tyrnet - someone had to do it.  That's right, inside one site it is more comfortable than switching between dozens, and if you still consider all sorts of new small projects that need to be registered?  - you can go crazy.  Google wave is an electronic desert in general, I immediately noticed the inconvenience - it is very difficult to delete messages, they cannot be removed at all when you clean a wave from an outside flame.  Then, I want to highlight one common flaw that is inherent in all these projects.  I will explain with an example.  When my dog ‚Äã‚Äãruns into the house after a walk, it instantly prowls through all the rooms - it conducts a reconnaissance, so to speak.  Why I need to explain this will not, I will say only that the person also has such a need, although it is expressed not so clearly.  So, in these three projects everything is very flawed with this visibility. <br><br>  As often happens, someone did not like the implementation, and he made his project.  I also intend to solve the above problems in my own way.  I wanted to name the project Singularity, but then I presented what it should look like.  No, it turns out, I am still far from navigating in a ten-dimensional stream of mental images, emotions, sensations, insights and dreams.  Full Shmatritsa is also not nearby, and does not entangle anyone with wires.  Ah, but I thought I swung well.  You have to cut the word to half, the project will be Singa.

      Imagine that in our time a person may need from a single portal.  Or maybe it is better to call the information system?  And the weather, and news, and email client, and search, virtual disk for storing files, non-click navigation, torrent client - what did I miss?  Okay, let's quit fantasies and talk about what we really want to do, by the way, and it will not be called a social network, it will be Singa Communication Platform: <br><br>  1. Blogs, chat rooms, forums, questions and answers, twitter tape, wikis, polls, news discussions - now everything will be with a single interface and from a single center.  A visual graph will allow you to flexibly control the course of the discussion and maneuver in the information flow.  After all, what unites all these services?  The fact that communication takes place in letters.  Singa will allow texts to assign different types of representations.  I selected a piece from the chat, pimknul the button "to the blog" - and everything, was shared and exhausted, without any extra kicks. <br><br>  2. Navigation - Do you want to be aware of all events and incidents?  Know where your friends are and what they do?  Know what's going on in the community?  Of course, in this you will be helped by indicators, indexes, ratings of topics and discussions, informational and analytical sections - everyone wants to be always on the wave! <br><br>  3. It will be possible to add objects to the system for discussion - people, brands, events, news.  Yes, it will be possible to add friends and acquaintances who are not registered in the network, create profiles for them, write them something on the wall, discuss with friends at different levels of privacy.  It will be possible to indicate to your friends that you know a person, even if he is not in the system or he did not confirm your request.  And the requests themselves are essentially not needed, we have democracy and freedom of speech. <br><br>  4. Recommended services, if properly file processed, will allow a breakthrough.  It will be possible not only to reliably pinpoint a person so that he will never see him again, but also of all such.  How this is done, you ask - it is very simple, there are only 16 psychological archetypes of people, but you did not know?  And also, recommendatory services will apply not only to people, but also to all types of content, even to messages, because they also have character.  And comments to posts will continue to be sorted according to your preferences, and you will not have to scroll the page in search of interesting points. <br><br>  In general, here it is, the near future.  The project will be done on Silverlight, because because ... Last time I wrote an invitation to participate in this project, several people responded, therefore, the work has already gone.  But I need more people, I want to put together a big, very big team.
