  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do not stand there, buy in the online store!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The round table "Popularization of e-commerce in Russia" last Friday ate a lot of time from lunch for all the guests of the conference "Electronic Commerce-2008".  And it is not by chance, because hotter topics for entrepreneurs in this industry are difficult to find today.  It is difficult to tell the buyer about online stores.  And to destroy the myths about them - more difficult to order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  To strike a decisive blow, become the shock groups of exemplary labor. </h6><br>  Tatyana Tsvetkova, director of marketing at Softkey, came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbringing together all the major market players in order to attract the attention of the country's inhabitants to the benefits of shopping on the Web.  How to do this is already a second matter, the main thing is to get together and start.  Softkey is supported in this by the Russian locomotive - Ozon shop. <br><br>  The direction in which it is necessary to ‚Äústrike‚Äù with informational activity is primarily television, according to Marina Pikuleva, deputy director of TNS Gallup Media for media research.  Because "the advanced part of the audience does not read the press."  Under the advanced here means the audience, in principle, ready to start buying on the Internet today. <br><br>  Arthur Welf, a correspondent for Money magazine and the author of IdeaBlog.ru, did not agree with her.  In his opinion, no promotion channels should be ignored.

    <h6>  Praising the online discounts for the rich, then trade along with the delegates </h6><br>  However, supporters of open collaboration on the promotion of online commerce during the discussion remained in the minority.  A hard share of the leaders who pave the way to the wallets of buyers for themselves and all the rest, they will have to carry themselves.  The reason is simple - it will be ‚Äúunrealistic‚Äù to agree on everything together, the head of Internet sales development at Eldorado Roman Gorshkov said. <br><br>  In this he was supported by Welf and Pikulev.  Marina told an interesting story about how TNS newsmen and radio broadcasters came to, who wanted to order research for joint companies, which had to prove that advertising from those and others was "better" than on TV.  The time has passed, but the result is not - the project sank under the weight of internal discrepancies. <br><br>  Fedor Virin from the Internet and Business Association (AIB), responding to the idea that AIB should become the logical unifying force of promoters in the industry, said that the desire of two stores is not enough.  We need people who are willing to competently work with the population.  And superfluous such people while, probably, do not suffice. <br><br><h6>  Stop the street current!  Remember: online shopping is entertainment </h6><br>  In the heat of the debate, Books.ru CEO Alexander Galunov also expressed his strong opinion, as always standing apart from general polemics.  He believes that "it would be necessary in general to start advertising for about a year and send money to improve the quality." <br><br>  And indeed, the myths about online stores are not always myths - the usability of sites and payment mechanisms, the work of reception and support of orders, delivery, etc., are still very weak.  Before attracting people from the street with advertising campaigns about convenience and advantageous prices, it is necessary to reach convenience and low prices not at the expense of low quality services. <br><br>  Alexey Ivanov, commercial director of the Sinilok marketing company, supported Alexander, saying that today he is trying ‚Äúnot to buy from his clients, because then I don‚Äôt want to advertise them‚Äù. <br><br><h6>  Hey, citizen!  In the network, hurry!  The benefits of the ruble, the expense - pennies </h6><br>  The only result that can be summed up with certainty: the period of <i>survival of</i> Internet commerce is over.  The movement towards the development of the industry that is starting now, although not yet organized, is worthy of attracting attention to it.  There is still a lot of walls to cross, but the business has already had a desire to fight for the buyer.  So it remains for buyers to come and grab the benefit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42402/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42402/</a></p>
