Part 3 - AR</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We have already considered the means of photorealistic visualization and saw a potential transition to environments with an additional presence effect due to a revival of interest in virtual reality (Virtual Reality, VR).  Many believe that the incredible excitement around virtual reality technologies will eventually turn into the sphere of augmented reality (Augmented Reality, AR). <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dell/blog/286496/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ce/8d0/731/2ce8d07319914105b9deece50f498e97.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Specialists in the field of design and development, even those who already know this term, should once again refer to the basics.  While virtual reality refers to the process of creating a completely digital world into which a user can dive, the difference between augmented reality technologies is that they combine the real world with virtual artifacts, objects or data. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  About augmented reality, like virtual, is not the first year, but the main steps in this direction have yet to be done.  This is partly due to the fact that the practical application of such technologies was possible only in highly specialized areas, but the main reason is the unavailability of the necessary equipment for most users.

      In recent years, the situation has changed.  The proliferation of high-performance smartphones with GPS modules, motion sensors and cameras means that consumers are accustomed to the possibility of overlaying information (in any form) on the representation of the real world using the device‚Äôs camera. <br><br>  Although this is a basic technology, which is largely due to the rapid growth of the augmented reality market, the facts are such that in order to create a more integrated and realistic augmented reality environment, displays should be placed directly on top of our best visual tools - the eyes. <br><br>  Most of those involved in the technology industry are aware of the Google Glass project, which combines a high-resolution display and glasses that look like ordinary ones.  This idea has been developed in a number of recent projects. <br><br>  Microsoft has come to grips with augmented reality technology and created the HoloLens platform. <br><br>  These are head-mounted displays that allow not only to overlay information on top of the user's real world view, but also to integrate motion capture, interaction and actions. <br><br>  Not only Microsoft is moving in this direction.  Other vendors (see below) are also trying to enter this market.  And let's face it: it's not just about games.  Augmented reality technologies have great potential in a professional environment and most of all in the field of development, design and production. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Augmented Reality Headsets: The Best Solutions</font> </h2><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/54f/7c4/e93/54f7c4e931c5f419b7e94252f7d3469a.jpg" align="left">  <b>Microsoft hololens</b> <br><br>  <i>Microsoft Hololens is perhaps one of the most anticipated devices on the market.</i>  <i>This solution can have enormous potential, given the company's reputation, the tight integration of developer kits with Windows and the massive budget for its creation.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Probably one of the most remarkable factors missed by many is that the Hololens platform is designed for autonomous use.</i>  <i>It is equipped with everything necessary and does not require additional devices.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Some vendors in the field of three-dimensional design are among the experimental partners, namely Autodesk, PTC, Trimble and Dassault Syst√®mes, and other companies will soon join them.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e0c/77e/638/e0c77e638624af103d72f3ac7c88e682.jpg" align="left">  <b>Osterhout Design Group (ODG) R-7</b> <br><br>  <i>Although most of the attention is paid to the Hololens platform, a number of other headsets are preparing for market entry with interesting solutions for augmented reality.</i>  <i>One of these headsets - R-7 from the company Osterhout Design Group.</i>  <i>It is also equipped with everything you need, for example, high-resolution displays for each eye, and has a more ‚Äúindustrial‚Äù design.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The recent joint project of ODG and the BMW Mini and receiving investments from 21st Century Fox will definitely help the company to become more famous.</i>  <i>You should also note that the first ODG product is based on the PTC Vuforia SDK, which indicates the company's serious intentions.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9ee/020/b20/9ee020b203be8401219ad8c9acf4d28f.jpg" align="left">  <b>Metavision Meta 2</b> <br><br>  <i>Metavision has gained the support of large investors and is about to release a second developer kit.</i>  <i>The headset is made in the expected form factor, but this development kit differs from Hololens and ODG R-7 in that it requires a connected device running Windows 8 or 10.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Specifications have not yet been determined, but thanks to the high-resolution display and sensors for tracking movements not only of the head, but also of the hands, the development of this solution is definitely worth watching.</i> </blockquote><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Possibilities of technologies of augmented reality in the field of development and design</font> </h2><br>  The potential of augmented reality technologies in the field of development and design is enormous.  As mentioned earlier, with the help of virtual reality, users can dive into a completely virtual world, while augmented reality allows you to work in the context of the real world.  Although sometimes only one object is involved in the design, there are many situations where a product must interact with the outside world and potential users. <br><br>  In this case, augmented reality can bring considerable benefits.  So far, mainly used physical prototypes, and so will be a long time.  But in many situations, a digital product, shown in the final version of its use, can be much more effective. <br><br>  An example would be solutions that interact with a person or surrounding products. <br><br>  The ability to evaluate a full-scale interactive prototype in context and interact with it, whether it is industrial equipment, architectural scale products or upgraded systems and products, opens up unlimited possibilities. <br><br>  Interestingly, some vendors are already trying to use displays with support for augmented reality and manual interaction technology (that is, using hands, not a controller).  Combining these solutions with the right equipment, we can discover new ways of interacting with geometric models and perform simulations outside of high-resolution flat-panel displays to achieve much greater results. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Integrated analytics and data overlay</font> </h2><br>  Another area in which active use of augmented reality technologies is expected is the imposition of data in the production and service environment.  For example, in modern factory workshops they are trying to introduce electronic means of processing and displaying data, but this trend is limited to existing flat-panel displays. <br><br>  With the development of augmented reality technology, a number of opportunities arise to radically change this process.  First, there are now technologies that allow you to overlay complex three-dimensional instructions directly related to a physical object. <br><br>  Imagine a worker on the assembly line following the instructions for assembling the product, and the necessary actions are not just shown on the headset, but are displayed directly on the head-mounted display along with additional information.  Need to tighten the bolt?  The display shows the required torque. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/817/f39/c85/817f39c8559587a46c7b488f613c224b.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Although simple components are required for the deployment of augmented reality technologies, they still require powerful computational resources.</font></i> <br><br>  PTC is one of the vendors moving in this direction.  The company recently acquired technologies related not only to virtual and augmented reality (for example, Vuforia, specializing in solutions for augmented reality), but also the infrastructure of the Internet of Things under the brand ThingWorx.  This allowed her to start producing products with the help of which the end user can independently create such solutions without the help of consultants. <br><br>  The first of these platforms, Vuforia Enterprise Studio, is already moving into a pilot project stage and is designed to make much more efficient use of complex three-dimensional geometry (one of the stumbling blocks for virtual and augmented reality). <br><br>  Other manufacturers are also not far behind: multifunctional solutions are being developed with convenient tools and sensor systems in combination with effective tools for analyzing and displaying information from operational staff. <br><br>  The possibility of overlaying this data over a real object right in front of you will not only come in handy for many companies, but will also contribute to the wide distribution of this technology. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Conclusion</font> </h2><br>  Augmented reality is very different from virtual.  Its essence is in the union of the real and virtual worlds.  As a result, the capabilities of these technologies in the field of development, design and production are different.  While using virtual reality, users can dive into a completely digital world, augmented reality allows you to complement and expand the real world with digital data.  Thanks to the possibility of using it in the context of the real world, this technology looks so promising. <br><br>  With the proliferation of connected devices, the amount of information that we will be able to use both in the design and operation will soon increase.  There are solutions with the help of which users can collect this data, analyze and filter them to obtain valuable information necessary in a given situation.  Many people believe that virtual reality technology will be widely spread with the advent of solutions that allow users to transfer this information directly to the work site.  Such solutions are already being developed. <br><br>  But the potential of such technologies is extremely high even in the earlier stages of the product life cycle, during its development.  The ability to research a product as if it had already been produced, right in the workplace, can change the industry drastically.  It is quite convenient to work with flat renders of an industrial enterprise or assembly line, but just imagine the opportunity to walk through an empty workshop and see this line in an established and working state.  You can immediately make the necessary changes. <br><br>  Interestingly, in this case, the basic requirement for the use of accurate and realistic three-dimensional data is not excluded, but, on the contrary, becomes fundamental for the entire solution. <br><br>  The experience and skills gained over the past two decades in the field of simulation, rendering and visualization of products will be applied and expanded.  And although augmented reality headsets are clearly becoming independent and do not require associated devices to be used, there will be a need for high-performance <a href="http://dell.ru/precision">Dell Precision</a> workstations to create materials for display and interaction. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://www.dellprecisionguides.com/SolidWorks/ru/">Dell SolidWorks eGuide</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://www.dellprecisionguides.com/Visualisation/ru/">Dell Visualization eGuide</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373221/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373221/</a></p>
