Logitech Driving Force GT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I had the desire to buy myself a good steering wheel, but for a long time there was something that had a higher priority and I only had a steering wheel now and almost by a miracle. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c64/08d/cb0/c6408dcb04031c1fee83182efb88f237.png" alt="image"><br>  Under the cut, a small review of the Logitech Driving Force GT (for 1990 rubles!) <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I go to shops rarely and usually sighting.  So this time, he helped grandma choose a radiotelephone. <br><br>  And pulled me to see the steering wheels.  Next to the PS3 in the window was a steering wheel, which stood out with a red wheel near the center.  Outwardly, I liked it and I began to rotate it.  He cranked 2 times and I felt the familiar resistance and buzzing, it said that he had a large angle of rotation and the right return. <br>  Looking at the price, I realized that for ridiculous money (for this level) a great steering wheel is given, the possibility of buying which is overshadowed only by the inscription ‚ÄúFor the PlayStation 3‚Äù and the very low price.

      After returning home, I scanned the Internet for what kind of gift it was and if there was any wood for windows. <br>  Found out <br><ol><li>  <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/441/4172%26cl%3Dru,ru%3Fosid%3D-1%26selectedFile%3D0">Firewood for Windows</a> XP / Vista / 7 </li><li>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DsDH-RmW4iZs">Reviews on youtube</a> say that the steering wheel works fine on a PC and that it is very good.  But his pedals are scolded :) By the way, the video lights on the steering wheel logo are blue, and my white one looks better. </li><li>  Fans of driving on different forums write that the price is certainly strange, but the steering wheel works fine. </li><li>  On <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx%3FItem%3DN82E16879212013%26cm_re%3DDriving_Force-_-79-212-013-_-Product">newegg.com,</a> this wheel is sold for at least $ 110 + $ 15, and as far as I know, this store is one of the best. </li></ol><br>  <b>About the inscription PlayStation3</b> . <br>  On the PlayStation3 inscription box, the same on the price tags, on the Logitech website in the ‚ÄúSpecifications‚Äù it says ‚ÄúPlayStation 2/3,‚Äù and nothing about the PC. <br>  When buying, the manager also told me that the steering wheel is only for PS3. <br><br>  This is actually somewhat strange.  But the presence of USB, drivers on the site and youtube allow you to ignore it. <br><br>  And the next day I made myself a gift, which I had long dreamed of. <br>  Put the NFS Shift and drove finally realizing how other sensations are obtained. <br>  Feedback is cool, it does not let you relax as when playing the keyboard, 900 degrees in most cases is not necessary.  I do not know for which game besides simulators such as Truckers or interactive driving courses you may need such a large angle. <br><br>  Along the way, I realized that either the game is poorly optimized (I only use 1 processor core), or my computer is pretty old. <br><br>  If you think that this is an eerie advertising post, then maybe you are right *, so if you don‚Äôt like something, don‚Äôt read further for there will be a link to the store. <br><br>  * I want as many people as possible to know about such a proposal.  I am pleased and maybe others will also be pleased to make such a gift to themselves or a friend. <br><br>  Here you can find out <a href="http://www.mvideobonus.ru/product_review/50009398.html">where to get</a> this steering wheel. <br><br>  A little later, I will check its characteristics with the help of the programs that were posted recently in the topic <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/73127/">Serious conversation about the steering wheels</a> . <br><br>  <b>The list of games with which I checked the work:</b> <br><ul><li>  <i>NFS Shift</i> - the game has two profiles for this helm with distinction in the pedals </li><li>  <i>Burnout Paradise</i> - has no profile, and at first it is not clear how to connect the steering wheel, because only the keyboard is on the list.  But just start to rotate it or press the keys as it is added to the list of devices and it can be configured. </li><li>  <i>Tutorial driving around the city</i> - in the tab the steering wheel customize actions as convenient for us.  The standard setting is designed for steering wheels with a small number of keys. </li></ul><br>  The rest have not had time, a lot of work, so I play in fragments. <br><br>  <b>Specifications:</b> <br><ul><li>  Force feedback </li><li>  Turn the steering wheel 900 degrees (from stop to stop makes 2.5 turns) </li><li>  28 cm rubber rim </li><li>  24-position adjustment knob (red wheel) </li><li>  Gas and brake pedals </li><li>  Sequential shift lever </li><li>  One-piece steering wheel design </li><li>  Customization for various games </li><li>  Optical coding (steering calibrated upon power up) </li><li>  PC compatibility </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Keys</b> <br>  Only 21 keys. <br>  Of these (those that are not visible in the picture) - 2 on the back of the steering wheel mounts, 2 on top of them.  The central logo key can be used as Horn. <br>  Joystick keys - 4 position switch and 4 standard keys for set-top boxes + PS, Select, Start buttons <br>  The red wheel rotates with clicks, it has no limiters.  Used to change the characteristics of the car or the review during the race. <br><br>  <b>Sensations</b> <br>  Nice steering surface, it is quite large and comfortable to hold. <br><br>  <b>Feedback</b> <br>  The return pipe is not as rigid as on other steering wheels, so when there is no resistance to it, it turns more easily.  But when it works, it works quite noticeably. <br>  <i>In the NFS Shift profile, the</i> steering wheel easily rotates 90 degrees in both directions, after which it rests against the resistance of the return, which shows that the steering wheel is completely turned in the car.  If with an effort to twist it further and remove his hands, he himself will return to the nearest extreme position. <br>  <i>In Burnout</i> , there is no ready profile, and probably therefore the steering wheel rotates immediately.  But this does not interfere with driving.  And when off the ground, the return line is turned off and the steering wheel becomes light.  This enhances the feeling of flight and the feeling of landing when the return valve seizes the steering wheel. <br><br>  About the gearbox to say nothing special.  Have not tried yet. <br><br>  The maximum size of the tabletop, for which you can safely cling the wheel about 3 centimeters.  I have it 1 millimeter thicker, so I just made a couple of recesses in the table. <br><br>  Pedals are like pedals, nothing special, it's a pity that there is no third one to play well with great realism. <br>  One of the reasons why I took the steering wheel is to finally change the automatic box to mechanics in games, so the presence of at least a simple shift lever was mandatory. <br><br>  <b>Features</b> <br>  I have a lot of devices in the computer, including USB. <br>  After the appearance of the steering wheel.  In the morning, when booting the computer, the system fell into a blue screen with a complaint about the food.  This problem occurs when the steering wheel is connected to the computer, but not connected to the network. <br>  The steering wheel works without connecting to the outlet, but the pedals and return flow do not work. <br><br>  Happy New Year to you and let your dreams come true, and new ones will take their place! <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> <br>  Test results with the program VKB JoyTester: <br>  Wheel <br><img src="http://lifeink.ru/habr/LogitechDrivingForceGTWheel.png" alt="Logitech Driving Force GT Steering Wheel"><br><br>  Gas pedal <br><img src="http://lifeink.ru/habr/LogitechDrivingForceGTAccelerator.png" alt="Logitech Driving Force GT Gas Pedal"><br><br>  Brake pedal <br><img src="http://lifeink.ru/habr/LogitechDrivingForceGTBrake.png" alt="Logitech Driving Force GT Brake Pedal"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79730/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79730/</a></p>
