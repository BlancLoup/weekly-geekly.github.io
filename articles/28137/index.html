  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Glitches and bugs ubuntu</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello.  Actually, the title already explains what will be described below.  But I still want to add a few words.  First of all, I understand that a certain number of errors are not glitches of ubuntu itself, but of the shortcomings of GNOM, or of individual applications.  But today I decided to write on behalf of a simple user who doesn‚Äôt care what language the program is written in and how the system components interact.  Secondly, I am a dedicated user of ubuntu.  In fact, I have 3 computers, and at all there is this Linux.  Therefore, I believe that I have the right to write about the shortcomings of my favorite software, from which I can hardly go anywhere.  Here we begin. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>1. Keyboard layout.</strong>  <strong>The bug turns out to be fixed.</strong> <br><br>  This glitch appeared on one machine out of three.  The fact is that the keyboard settings in the gnome are not saved, so every time you turn on the computer, you have to reinstall the Russian layout. <br>  It is treated by directly fitting the switch settings in xorg.conf.  But after that, the keyboard layout indicator flatly refuses to display the current language. <br><br>  <strong>upd</strong> <br>  Habrapapolzovatel <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/maniak/" class="user_link">maniak</a> told that if you update your distr, then you already fixed this bug.  You just need to delete the settings of the gnome about the keyboard (~ / .gconf / desktop / gnome / peripherals / keyboard) and remove the shamanism in xorg.conf (if you made it).

      <strong>2. Glitches in the paths in the nautilus.</strong> <br><br>  Very interesting problem.  Even somewhat difficult to explain.  I have a number of folders on my computer, in which there are several hundred files and there are also subfolders.  So, if you go to the subfolder, all the files of the current directory are displayed, and then click "Back", you can see such a pleasant result: <br><img src="http://bal-s.ru/upload/ubuntu_bugs/1.gif" alt="Actually, the result"><br><br>  After that, the nautilus does not want to go anywhere at all and refuses to work. <br><br>  <strong>3. Dwarf tightly hangs when the mounted device is unavailable</strong> <br><br>  I have long been a known bug, a bug to me personally and terribly annoying.  The dwarf simply stops working if a ball is not available, mounted for example from a server.  And, of course, no one opens the files located there.  I just want to work, for example, in a text editor, or open a document on a completely different device, but there is no. <br><br>  <strong>4. Resolution of applications written in python.</strong> <br><br>  One of my computers, if I may say so, is EeePC.  There, of course, is also worth ubuntu.  And just at a resolution of less than 800 √ó 600 this very unpleasant glitch is observed.  All programs written in Python (for example, Exaile or CCSM) completely refuse to be displayed normally with a low screen resolution.  They literally jump into different corners of the display when any control is activated. <br>  Treatment: do not use the program written in python.  Smarter did not invent anything. <br>  By the way, why does this happen with these programs, nobody knows? <br><br>  <strong>5. Brakes when calling the "Exit ..." menu item.</strong>  <strong>TREATMENT FOUND !!!</strong> <br><br>  This bug is observed only on one computer, and it is mine.  Apparently, I was incredibly lucky, but I had to wait 3 minutes for the emergence of a logout dialogue.  This is clearly a bust. <br>  Cured by creating such nice little buttons in the panel menu with elementary commands: <br><img src="http://bal-s.ru/upload/ubuntu_bugs/2.gif" alt="Buttons"><br>  <strong>upd</strong> <br>  As suggested by habrahpolyuchil @Kroops, in the sessions it is necessary to include the power management service, which some unscrupulous comrades from the same forum.ubuntu.ru considered necessary only for laptops. <br><br>  <strong>6. Disadvantage: brazenly thrown out of the menu displayconfig-gtk.</strong> <br><br>  What for?  I do not understand.  Instead of this application, which could at least something to adjust, put stupid gnome-display-properties, which can not even correctly determine the frequency of updating the screen. <br>  Of course, displayconfig-gtk has not gone anywhere.  You can also call it all up by typing its name in the console, or the launch menu of arbitrary commands, but you don‚Äôt know about it, right? <br><br>  <strong>7. Some programs do not quite correctly register themselves in the main menu.</strong> <br><br>  Take, for example, AptonCD.  After installation, a start button with the / usr / bin / aptoncd command flaunts in the ‚ÄúAdministration‚Äù menu.  What will happen after such a launch?  Prog will swear on the impossibility of working with packages and so on.  The command should look like this: gksudo / usr / bin / aptoncd.  It is for such shortcomings that ordinary people do not switch to Linux. <br><br>  <strong>8. The ‚Äúuser settings‚Äù item in the visual effects settings has disappeared.</strong> <br><br>  Well, I think all users of compiz-fuzion are aware of this problem.  Degradation of the face.  After all, uncomfortable.  It is impossible to switch to the "Standard Effects" and then return to your settings. <br><br>  <strong>9. Corpses of improperly disconnected flash drives in nautilus.</strong> <br><br>  Sometimes it happens that a comrade who has sat down at your computer, does not know that it is necessary to turn off the hooks safely, etc.  etc.  By the way, this glitch happens randomly and is the prerogative of only some devices, especially mobile phones, which ubuntu does not remove, as it were, not to disconnect them correctly.  As a result, we get a bunch of mounted devices that hang in the nautilus. <br><br>  <strong>10. Glitch with dragging files past the menu item "Network servers".</strong> <br><br>  Open any folder, take the file from the desktop and start dragging it into this folder.  At the time when it will be located on the ‚ÄúNetwork Servers‚Äù item, ubuntu will consider it necessary to browse the entire local area. copy to "network: ///".  And who wanted to copy it there? <br>  Here is a highly artistic illustration showing this process: <br> <a href="" title="Clickable"><img src="http://bal-s.ru/upload/ubuntu_bugs/4.gif" alt="Illustration"></a> <br><br>  Treatment: copy files carefully.  But such an error is still somewhat distracting from normal work. <br><br>  <strong>11. PulseAudio.</strong> <br><br>  Before him everything was fine, the grass is greener, the sun was shining brighter and so on.  It seems someone somewhere wrote that by default this sound subsystem is not activated, but a fact on the face.  After installing ubuntu, the video slowed down, the sound chewed.  Cured by sudo apt-get command remove pulseaudio purge.  But Audacity stopped working normally.  Now, having looked at each sound device and after thinking for a couple of minutes, he happily reports that he will not be able to work with him.  About the problem googled, did not help = ( <br><br>  <strong>12. Screenshots are not taken during the open context menu.</strong> <br><br>  This problem was clarified during the preparation of the article, a snapshot is taken, and that's it.  Screenshots, respectively, not attached =) <br><br>  It has long been known that there is no perfect system.  In ubuntu, the number of errors that annoy me is two-digit.  In Windows, this number consists of three digits, and the poppy is not for a person living in a province.  Anyway, I'm not going to leave my favorite system, and you? <br><br>  <font><a href="http://bal-s.ru/index.php%3Fshow%3Dtext%26blog%26id%3D13">Same</a> on my site</font> <br><br>  <strong>updated 2</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28137/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28137/</a></p>
