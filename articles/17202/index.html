Then I received a little feedback, but habrarey usually pleased with sensible comments.  In addition, recently slipped a great example of how to use mobile devices in the topic " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/p2p/31820.html">Mobile torrents: 2008 hit</a> ." <br><br><h2>  Calculate together </h2><br>  There are such sites / programs that allow you to use the resources of any computer in a cluster of computers to handle some serious tasks that require very, very many calculations. <br><br><h2>  Child computing </h2><br>  My task is much more local and mundane.  It is worth the cradle PDA.  400Mhz, 128Ram.  Yes, a couple of years ago, my desk was a little bit better.  And this flint flies, sticks out in a cradle and relaxes.  I think it's a mess =).  It is necessary to take in the work, so it would be great if there was software that allowed sharing task processing resources from the PDA.  (I really hope that the comments will provide links from where you can download the latest developments in this direction;).

      For example, I threw two gig docks into a rar, the PDA intercepted and works on the background, the desktop is free for <s>hdtv showing porn</s> parsing of this docks in the desired format. <br><br>  In the meantime, we have to adapt the PDA for simpler tasks.  (At this point at home, this is less relevant since I bought myself a second monitor). <br><br><h2>  Examples of child labor </h2><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Therefore, while my PDA performs the role of: <br><ul><li>  <b>Slideshow photo frame with a calendar</b> - it was already built into my PDA and I liked it, the screensaver is just like that.  Shows the taken pictures by default.  But no one bothers to put other images in there.  For example, beloved, family, computers;).  Plus: calendar, current date and time. </li><li>  <b>Audio player</b> - you throw more music on SD, open the playlist, stick headphones into the pda and enjoy.  The space on the big monitor is freed from Winamp, and poking a finger is more pleasant for me to change songs, volume and sound than with the mouse / keyboard in the old fashioned way.  At least some sense of manufacturability.  I can't wait for the big touch monitors to become cheaper so that you can always just poke a finger and on the big monica when it is convenient. </li><li>  <b>Video player</b> - the screen is of course too small, on my home 19-shke in my corner a larger window usually hangs with BSPlayer and doesn‚Äôt particularly hinder the rest of the work.  But still, this is already on another monitor, and again, <i>manual</i> control =) </li><li>  <b>Notebook for notes</b> - this task is always carried out by the PDA, but I want to draw attention to the example of the situation when it is necessary for several lines of text to be constantly visible.  For example, current variables.  Or the names of the classes with the description in the new CSSC, which I have not yet remembered. </li></ul>  In general, with a cpk, you can try to replace the absence of a second monitor and try to display on it what would have to be displayed on top of all windows on the main monitor. <br><br>  For example, it is very convenient to show all sorts of charts so that the <a href="http://djsv.livejournal.com/27369.html" title="I recommend reading about interesting 'cheat sheets' for web developers.">Cheat Sheets</a> and tables are visible. <br><br><h2>  Look wider </h2><br>  PDA yes.  But there are still mobile phones, digital cameras, consoles, etc.  I would also like to make them work :).  Here, for example, my router can boldly write in the topic "I am smart."  He has Linux, he raised ftp and broadcasting from a web-camera.  Hands do not reach yet, but it itches, itches to strung it with something else =). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17202/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17202/</a></p>
