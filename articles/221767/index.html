In my particular case, these are casual games for social networks (hereinafter - the market). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By casual games, I mean the gameplay, which does not require any special effort from the player (zadrotstva, special sharpened skill).  The gameplay, which allows you to devote the game quite a bit of time and nerves for the varying degrees of noticeable progress in the gameplay.  The whole topic of kazualok is very extensive and has a long history, there are a lot of different views, interpretations and opinions, but this is not about that. <br>  Everyone who makes / made / is going to make a game faces various kinds of difficulties. <br>  From problems with the concept and diz.Dokom to financial difficulties.  We will talk about them. <br><br>  Any game in a social network is at least 2 things: <br>  1) basic gameplay <br>  2) social component (teasers, gifts / requests to friends, etc.)

      Some soc.  networks provide hosting for files, so the first point we can get around for free, so to speak.  But the second paragraph still implies the presence of a game server with a database.  The server (s) can stand in a pretty penny. <br>  Therefore, logical for all igrodelov raises the question of monetization of the game at least at such a level that it does not bring losses after the launch (the cost of manufacturing in this case will not be taken into account). <br><br>  The free-to-play model has already settled on the market.  Her and take on board. <br>  <i>PS: just now, please, without emotion.</i>  <i>I understand that for many this model is evil in the flesh.</i>  <i>However, it can be good and fluffy.</i>  <i>If we do not pursue the goal of scattering and undressing the player previously erected in a pose to a goal - then the free-to-play model is the most monetization option for this player.</i>  <i>In everything there should be a measure and a good message.</i> <br><br><h4>  The first thing we have to decide is that THAT we will sell to the player. </h4><br>  You can try to throw a rough list of what can be sold to the player: <br><blockquote>  1) content <br>  2) additional functions <br>  3) advantage over other players <br>  4) time <br>  5) your options in the comments </blockquote><br><br>  Let's go through them in order. <br><br><h5>  <b>Selling content.</b> </h5><br>  Selling content, at first glance, is typical for farm games.  Where, if not in the builder, the house with a veranda that is colorful but absolutely useless in terms of game balance or utility is best monetized. <br>  Also, Tamagotchi games sell content well.  A knitted warm hat for 10 rubies / crystals for your pet will be much better than a default cap or bandanas. <br>  The beauty of selling beautiful paid content in such games is revealed in a particular degree if the game has the ability to enter / visit friends.  Here, the players include greed and envy, which is logical. <br>  The theme of customization in games is very specific in nature.  People strive for individuality.  A unique and paid content perfectly emphasizes it.  This is not to argue. <br>  Let's not forget about the plot games.  For example, a plot object search, which successfully migrated from the PC games era, is perfectly monetized on the sale of additional story lines and new tasks (a parallel is drawn with the payed games model that is not particularly relevant on the market, when a player receives content only after payment, in fact in the bag). <br>  Also, many gameplays that can be broken into levels (match-3 games, crossword-guessing games) are also divided into pseudo-story chapters, opening / unlocking of which also brings a percentage to the cashier. <br>  In general, selling content is always the right move.  You should not, of course, aggravate the position of the player to such an extent that in order to play, he will have to pay.  This is absurd.  Few will be interested in such an attitude. <br><br><h5>  <b>Sale of additional features</b> </h5><br>  Often, in games there are meta-functions that are not the basis of the basic gameplay, but serve as a supplement.  For example, the suggested letter in a crossword puzzle for 1 ruble.  Or, for example, the speed of movement of the character in the game world.  In the miracle boots fast walkers for 5 rubles, it will become more pleasant than a long wait for animation.  Or, maybe, a booster, showing the trajectory of the ball. <br>  In general, under the additional functions, everything is assumed that will make it easier for the player to exist in the game world for himself. <br>  This is a very strong monetization scheme.  Highly.  Depending on the genres, offers to purchase such functions, inserted at the right time in the right place - get a very large percentage of purchases.  The main thing - do not overdo it.  The ideal scheme is simply to facilitate the passage.  There is a very thin line between ‚Äúbuy to play more confidently‚Äù and all the hated pay-to-win.  In-game purchase should not reduce gameplay to zero.  Otherwise, sports interest will disappear. <br>  I will try to give an example.  Say, Arkanoid.  Bad purchase - a machine gun at the beginning of the round.  A good purchase is an increased chance of a machine gun falling out of blocks.  Why?  You can speculate in the comments.  Everyone will be happy. <br><br><h5>  <b>Selling advantage over other players</b> </h5><br>  Oooochen controversial scheme.  In games that involve challenges / battles with an opponent - this is the most dangerous, but at the same time, one of the coolest monetization schemes.  Balance is a shaky thing.  And dissatisfaction with the balance in the game is the most dangerous enemy of the igrodels.  If paying players have super-magic or a huge cudgel, against which there is no admission - that's all, dozens, then hundreds, and then thousands of disappointed players begin to delete the game.  I watched at least one game, which at the stage of formation of the gaming community embarked on the sale of uber-pieces.  And watched as she bent safely in just 3 weeks.  The thing is that this model of monetization gives a powerful surge in in-game purchases at the first stage.  Then, as users become churned, wrong attempts are being made to return income to the previous level with even bigger bonuses for paying players, which, in turn, of course, will again give an increase in income, but will repel an even greater percentage of players.  Like a snowball launched from the top of a mountain, it is becoming more and more difficult to stop this process every minute. <br>  Therefore, if such purchases are planned in your game, think carefully about everything.  Revise the balance of all such purchases in the lower direction before rolling out the update to the players.  Increase the advantage of donate-oors - you can at any time.  But to pick up in the event of an attempt to rebalance - it will be difficult and with screams in the community. <br><br><h5>  <b>Sale time</b> </h5><br>  The most popular way to monetize games.  Life / attempts / hearts that end from time to time.  Houses under construction, then an hour, then two, then ten.  Timer-related building / process improvements.  All this is an attempt to sell the player his time.  The most impatient will buy.  Rational - will accelerate only what they deem important.  The most diligent and / or principled - will wait. <br>  In fact, the sale of time intersects with the artificial restriction of the gaming session.  This is also a very popular technique when the gameplay is in fact - for a couple of hours, and with timers - the gameplay stretches to a day or more.  It is important not to bend the stick. <br>  Depending on the category of the game, its genre and gameplay, it will be a good practice to study competing games.  Google the average game session length for your game type.  And, based on the collected data, limit the player's actions.  Test on a little traffic.  See statistics.  And balance so that players return to the game as often as possible in a day. <br><br><h4>  The second, equally important question - how to sell. </h4><br>  And, in principle, this issue can be given a separate post. <br>  Unless, of course, you are interested in my thoughts on this. <br>  Please leave your observations and comments in the comments.  The topic is very deep and interesting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221767/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221767/</a></p>
