Let us analyze the statistics of mobile OS and browsers on the Internet (according to liveinternet data): <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  13% - Opera mini (as a rule, it is used in regular phones with java2me support); <br>  2% - Mobile Safari Browser - iOS (iPhone, iPod, iPad); <br>  1% - Android devices;

      Thus, the share of mobile browsers is about 15% of all Internet traffic.  This is a significant percentage, and it must be considered.  Growth is very big.  Back in 2009, there were only 2 million mobile visitors per day for the entire runet.  Now there are more than 10 million per day. <br><br>  Evaluate the capabilities of the browsers of these mobile devices. <br><br><h5>  Opera mini </h5><br>  Allows you to open any sites, for this applies zuming.  Zooming is relatively convenient if the mobile device has a touch display with multitouch support.  However, when using only the joystick, page navigation significantly slows down.  This is acceptable if you need to receive any information once, and the user is already familiar with the navigation of this site.  Otherwise, the user may simply not see important information, because  Zooming allows you to see only a relatively small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe page at a time.  This problem is also relevant if the user has already been on the site - he can still miss some important information. <br><br>  We should also note the dynamic elements of the page (pop-up blocks, non-standard drop-down lists, etc.).  Because  there is no javascript support in the browser itself - all scripts are first executed on the remote server of the Opera software company, and only then the result is sent to the mobile device - then there are no guarantees in correct operation of the dynamic interface elements. <br><br>  Opera Mini also has the ability to "rebuild" the site for a mobile look.  And many people take advantage of this opportunity (however, not everyone knows about the existence of such an option), but in this case, the browser itself decides in what sequence and in what form to provide the user with information.  In many cases it is convenient and reduces traffic.  But not always the information is arranged in such a way as would be convenient for the user or the owner of the site. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> surfing an unfamiliar site is much more convenient when there is a mobile version. <br><br><h5>  Mobile Safari Browser (iOS) </h5><br>  Very functional browser with support for javascript, many CSS 3, HTML 5 features. Because  all devices on which it is installed have multi-touch touchscreen displays, and the latest versions of the devices themselves have a very decent resolution - up to 960 pixels in width, then surfing through such a browser is very close to the desktop one, however, still The default text and images are too small.  However, it is worth noting that in all mobile devices there is no such important interface element as ‚Äúguidance‚Äù.  Thus, if we have, for example, a horizontal menu with a second level that appears when hovering over the first one, we simply cannot bring about the second level of the menu on mobile devices.  Guidance is a frequently used event in interfaces.  All of the above also applies to browsers on Android devices.  Almost all such devices have multitouch, javascript-engines. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> surfing from such devices is much more convenient than from push-button telephones, however there are a number of interface restrictions and the likelihood that the user will not see any important information due to the use of suming.  At the same time, the traffic level will be equal to the desktop one. <br><br>  It is worth noting the fact that users of such devices love and use the features of touch interfaces.  Therefore, in some cases it makes sense to develop a version of the interface specifically for such devices.  To do this, there is a special <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/" title="jQuery Mobile">jQuery Mobile</a> library that allows you to track many interface events of mobile browsers (for example, various gestures, keeping your finger on an element), and also has a number of embedded interface elements familiar to mobile users. <br><br><h4>  Traffic </h4><br>  An important factor when surfing from a mobile device is the cost of traffic and the speed of downloading sites. <br>  In our country, the mobile Internet is still expensive, slow, unlimited tariffs usually have a number of restrictions (low speed, pseudo-unlimited). <br><br>  Internet speed, even with 3g, is still very small. <br><br>  Therefore, for many users an important factor is the "lightness" of the site.  They prefer to visit simple sites without flash and text ads.  They do not need beautiful, but cumbersome interfaces, gradients, animations.  Most prefer the information in a simple, convenient form.  The reason for this is not only traffic and download speed, but also banal screen sizes, which, as a rule, are only enough to display a small amount of information. <br><br><h4>  Alternative to the mobile version </h4><br>  If the main goal of your site is to bring text information to users, then perhaps RSS will be a better and economical solution. <br><br>  <i>RSS is a family of XML formats for describing news feeds, article announcements, blog changes, etc. Information from various sources, presented in the RSS format, can be collected, processed and presented to the user in a convenient way by special programs. aggregators.</i> <br><br>  All mobile browsers have the ability to receive RSS.  And many phones have special RSS clients. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  On the one hand, almost all mobile browsers are somehow able to display and work correctly with most sites.  However, if there is a mobile version of the site, many users will prefer it rather than the ‚Äúheavyweight‚Äù one, since  Traffic and convenience are a critical factor in mobile surfing.  However, you should always give the opportunity to switch between the mobile and the main version, because not everyone prefers the ‚Äúmobile view‚Äù.  A good tone is to give the user a choice between the mobile and main versions before downloading any of them. <br><br>  Examples of popular mobile versions of sites: <br>  m.vkontakte.ru, m.ya.ru, m.mail.ru, etc. <br><br>  If you want to save money and develop a universal version, then try to avoid such interface events as ‚Äúhovering‚Äù.  This is especially true for drop-down navigation elements. <br><br>  Also, if you have a very large portal with a large number of visitors, you should think not so much about the mobile version of browsers, but about developing special applications that allow you to receive information in a convenient form on mobile devices. <br>  So did many.  For example, Vkontakte, Twitter, Facebook. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122887/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122887/</a></p>
