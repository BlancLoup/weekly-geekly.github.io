These were the Vkontakte, Mobango, Myspace, Badoo, QIP, Dropbox, Rambler, LinkedIn, Twitter, and other databases. For several months, with the active participation of the hack community, hacker profiles were blocked in almost all the darknet communities.  By May 2016, tessa88 had completely disappeared from the Internet.  In the following months, numerous attempts were made to reveal the identity of the hacker.  However, no concrete evidence linking tessa88 to any real person was presented. <br><br>  New data suggest that under the pseudonym tessa88 may be Maxim Donakov, a resident of Penza, who used several different profiles on the darknet.  It is possible that he had an accomplice who led the account tessa88, strictly adhering to the procedures OPSEC and to this day remaining anonymous.  In any case, the Insikt Group experts are convinced that Maxim Donakov received a direct benefit from the sale of compromised databases and should be considered as the main actor.

    <h2>  Key Judgments </h2><br><ul><li>  The criminal career of tessa88 probably began as early as 2012, before the massive data leaks on LinkedIn, Dropbox, Yahoo, and others, which are the responsibility of the hackers acting under this pseudonym.  Probably the tessa88 profile was created specifically for the sale of valuable databases. </li><li>  Analysis Insikt Group, based on the detected images of a real person, hiding under the nickname tessa88, and discussions from numerous forums, allows us to conclude with a high degree of probability that tessa88 is a man, not a woman. </li><li>  According to the Insikt Group, the tessa88 profile is associated with a number of other accounts: Paranoy777, Daykalif and tarakan72511.  These users posted similar photos on social networks, the corresponding photos in the passport of Maxim Donakov, a young man known in the network under the pseudonym Paranoy777. </li><li>  Insikt Group reports that Donakov Maxim Vladimirovich lives on the territory of the Russian Federation. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec9/2e0/221/ec92e0221595161829288b6f30d8a657.jpg"><br>  <i>Disclosure of personality tessa88</i> <br><br><h2>  Background </h2><br>  According to Recorded Future, Peace_of_Mind, also known as Peace, sold LinkedIn to the database on May 16, 2016 on the now-non-existent TheRealDeal Market.  According to the results of the investigation of the theft of LinkedIn databases in October 2016, the FBI arrested a citizen of the Russian Federation Yevgeny Nikulin.  He was arrested in the Czech Republic and later extradited to the United States.  At the time of this writing, the investigation has not yet been completed and no objective evidence linking Nikulin to Peace_of_Mind has been provided. <br><br>  The Motherboard edition published the findings of an interview with tessa88, who claimed that he was a longtime member of the criminal community, and accused Peace_of_Mind of stealing databases that were sold by tessa88.  Peace_of_Mind, in turn, argued that tessa88 itself stole databases for sale on the Internet. <br><br>  According to a report from InfoArmor, tessa88 acted as an intermediary who sold accounts and personal data stolen by a group of hackers called ‚ÄúGroup E‚Äù.  InfoArmor claims (Recorded Future also confirmed this) that tessa88 was the first to post a database for sale in February 2016.  In May 2016, InfoArmor claimed that tessa88 and Peace_of_Mind agreed to share at least some of the compromised databases in a likely attempt to speed up the monetization of a huge amount of data.  The relationship between tessa88 and Peace_of_Mind deteriorated as other members of the underground community claimed that the data was unreliable.  Thus, the report from InfoArmor confirms the findings of the Motherboard and explains the outright hostility between the two hackers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c3/52e/b17/7c352eb17f32d4c4d33131aabea6edb3.jpg"><br>  <i>The activities of tessa88, also known as stervasgoa on darknet, are from February to May 2016.</i> <br><br><h2>  Analysis </h2><br>  As a result of the analysis of the darknet resources, it was possible to match the tessa88 profile with a number of accounts, including Jabber (tessa88 @ exploit [.] Im, tessa88 @ xmpp [.] Jp, mrfreeman777 @ xmpp [.] Jp, darksideglobal @ exploit [.] Im) , ICQ 740455 account and firetessa @ yahoo e-mail [.] com. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/291/03d/ce7/29103dce7e5ea40f48af3fa64db9bab1.png"><br>  <i>Tessa88 sells a database of LinkedIn and MySpace websites in an underground forum that is currently closed.</i> <br><br>  On July 5, 2016, a Twitter user @firetessa announced that the Jabber account tessa88 @ exploit [.] Im, used by tessa88 for sale in underground forums, belongs to him. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10b/92c/b20/10b92cb20f590a1af74af3322cd595f8.png"></div><br>  <i>Tweet by @firetessa</i> <br><br>  TraX user, a member of the hacking community, said that tessa88 is male and posted a proposed photo on the forum.  TraX also said that tessa88 was behind the recent hacks and the subsequent sale of LinkedIn, MySpace and Yahoo, and even expressed its willingness to share this information with reporters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50f/255/f10/50f255f1065ff7b29de10a13dc66c606.png"><br>  <i>Estimated photo of user tessa88</i> <br><br>  During investigations based on open data (OSINT), the tarakan7251 account (on Imgur) was identified, from which screenshots of discussions about Yahoo and Equifax data leaks implemented by HelloWorld and Ibm33a14 users were published.  It is noteworthy that Ibm33a14 is a Russian-speaking hacker who claimed in 2017 that he owns the originals of the dumps of the Yahoo and Equifax databases. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1a/0b8/b88/d1a0b8b886993fa0013e1a5f57fba855.png" width="400"></div><br>  <i>Screenshot chat on Yahoo and Equifax</i> <br><br>  The same Imgur account in 2017 published a photo titled ‚Äútessa88‚Äù, which depicts a man whose appearance resembles the person depicted in the above photo posted by TraX. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a98/b42/a8d/a98b42a8d45c2e56bc0eb07372dad68e.png" width="400"></div><br>  <i>Likely image of tessa88</i> <br><br>  The alias tarakan72511 is used by the hacker Paranoy777, who owns the Jabber tarakan72511 @ chatme [.] Im account.  Paranoy777 and tessa88 both sold stolen databases of large social networks and IT companies in 2016. <br><br>  Recorded Future found a complaint filed against tarakan72511, which stated that Daykalif is a Russian-speaking criminal who sold known databases and used Jabber <a href="">accounts daykalif @ xmpp [.]</a> <a href="">Jp</a> and <a href="">tarakan72511 @ chatme [.] Im</a> - the same Jabber account used by the user Paranoy777, which in turn is associated with the account tarakan72511.  If this statement is true, then it is likely that the users of Paranoy777 and Daykalif are the same person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a12/f08/dbe/a12f08dbef6fee73c095f42ddbabbf2e.png"><br>  <i>Complaint discovered on the underground forum</i> <br><br>  The user tarakan72511 (on Imgur resource) shared information about the love of dogs.  YouTube account user Tarakan72511 Donakov posted a video in which two people feed stray dogs, which is a reference to a profile with Imgur.  The video says that they are in Penza.  Car on video - Mitsubishi Lancer with registration number K652BO 58. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41c/fe4/141/41cfe414138ef50021be6266cbf30775.png"></div><br>  <i>YouTube user profile Tarakan7251 Donakov.</i> <br><br>  In addition, Guy Fawkes mask is visible at the 56th second of the video.  A similar mask was used as an avatar in the YouTube profile of Tarakan72511 Donakov, and also put on the person in the image shared by the user TraX. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aec/148/424/aec148424b3608b4a8739c461f14d47b.png"></div><br>  <i>Guy Fawkes mask on YouTube videos, YouTube user avatar and Trax user image.</i> <br><br>  In the course of the investigation of OSINT in relation to Donakov (Donakov) from Penza, it turned out that someone named MV Donakov.  committed several crimes in the cities of Yaroslavl and Penza, including accidents involving the car Mitsubishi Lancer in 2017.  Citizen Donakov Maxim Vladimirovich, who was born in Yaroslavl and moved to Penza, was noted in several articles on sudact.ru, which refers to the commission of a number of crimes, after which M. Donakov was sent into custody. <br><br>  Based on these records, three profiles were identified on the Odnoklassniki resource, all named Maxim Donakov, two of which indicated their current location as Yaroslavl, and one as Penza.  The first profile in ‚ÄúClassmates‚Äù belongs to a man who lived in Yaroslavl and was born on July 2, 1989.  The last time a user visited the site was September 9, 2013.  The second Odnoklassniki profile has the same name and date of birth as the previous profile.  The photo of both profiles shows the same person as on the tarakan72511 profile in Imgur.  The image of the Mitsubishi Lancer with state number A 134MK 76 is remarkable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/466/172/e0e/466172e0e497a9f99a83b8a27e2f012c.png"><br>  <i>Profile photo of Maxim Donakov in Odnoklassniki</i> <br><br>  Analysis of the second profile in Odnoklassniki showed that the hacker is connected with another user, the Poisonous Cockroach, allegedly residing in Pervomaisk in Ukraine.  The name ‚ÄúPoisonous Cockroach‚Äù is consonant with the tarakan72511 account on Imgur, and the profile picture of a person strongly resembles Maxim Donakov.  It should be noted that Pervomaisk - the real place of birth of Maxim Donakov.  Given the above facts, with a high degree of confidence we can say that the profile "Poisonous cockroach" also belongs to Maxim Donakov. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c52/26c/f85/c5226cf85d1292d445a08d57dbfeb9cb.png"></div><br>  <i>Photo of another profile of Maxim Donakov in "Classmates"</i> <br><br>  Confidential sources confirmed that Maxim Donakov is a real person, born July 2, 1989.  According to SudAct, Donakov was released under police supervision, but was then imprisoned after committing another crime in 2014.  This may explain the existence of several profiles in Odnoklassniki, since Donakov may have been forced to create a new profile after being released from prison if he forgot the credentials for his previous account. <br><br>  The OSINT investigation revealed a number of other accounts and contact information most likely related to Donakov (tessa88): the VKontakte profile of Maxim Ivanov with the phone number +79022222229, the profiles of Vkrugudruzei and Valet.ru, the YouTube account Maxim Donakov with the phone number +17789981919 .  An open web search for Maxim Donakov showed the Gulik01 profile on Freelance.ru, which may belong to tessa88 (Donakov).  In his account Gulik01 indicated that he is a Russian-speaking freelancer in the field of information technology. <br><br>  Moreover, additional searches in the leaked databases revealed Maxim Donakov, a resident of Penza, born on July 2, 1989, coinciding with the user profile information from the above-mentioned Odnoklassniki profiles and an image titled "tessa88" posted by Imgur tarakan72511, which shows the same person.  Again, all this suggests that tessa88 is really Maxim Donakov. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2df/e30/464/2dfe304648c5f2821c91c08b070bc67d.png"><br>  <i>Tessa88 Bitcoin Wallet Analysis</i> <br><br>  An analysis of transactions involving a Bitcoin <i>-</i> approved tessa88 wallet using the Crystal Blockchain (conducted by the Insikt Group) showed that the hacker received at least 168 bitcoins or about $ 90,000, and most of the funds were eventually laundered through LocalBitcoins, a popular peer exchange service.  Despite blocking the hacker in May 2016, he continued to use his Bitcoin wallet until August 2017. <br><br><h2>  Analysis results </h2><br>  Insikt Group with a high degree of confidence assesses tessa88 as one of the many nicknames created by Maxim Donakov for selling databases on underground forums.  In addition, it is likely that Donakov was active on the darknet at least since 2012, and also used the pseudonyms Paranoy777, Daykalif, and tarakan72511. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b0/ec6/8c7/3b0ec68c75dc4e6ff78caf92d08b29a7.png"></div><br>  <i>Maxim Donakov, known as tessa88, Paranoy777 and Daykalif</i> <br><br>  Donakov Maxim Vladimirovich was born on July 2, 1989, a resident of the Russian Federation, who previously lived in Yaroslavl, and later moved to Penza.  Analysis of accounts in social networks and other resources Recorded Future confirms the findings of the Insikt Group. <br><br>  According to the analysis, the pseudonyms tessa88, Paranoy777 and Daykalif were created specifically for the sale of compromised data on the darknet.  Given the controversial information about database theft of the above companies, it is difficult to determine the real strategy and methods used by hackers.  However, the upcoming investigation into the case of Evgeny Nikulin, connected with a leak of data on LinkedIn, can shed light on this story and fill in the remaining gaps. <br><br>  The article was <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/tessa88-identity-revealed/"><b>published by</b></a> Insikt Group on November 20, 2018. <br><br>  <i>Translation: Denis Gavrilov, Consultant of the Jet Infosystems Information Security Center</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431450/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431450/</a></p>
