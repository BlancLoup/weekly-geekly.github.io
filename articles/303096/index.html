      First of all, the content is ‚Äúabsorbed‚Äù through communication devices, mobile phones.  Accordingly, <b>publishers for such a target audience need to submit information in a more ‚Äúlively‚Äù manner, being on the same wavelength with the youth.</b>  <b>It is necessary to exclude a boring and homogeneous presentation and to focus on interactive.</b> <br><br>  <b>Why the ‚Äúselfie generation‚Äù?</b> <br><br>  The term ‚Äúselfie‚Äù can be used to describe the entire modern generation of digital.  And this is not only a self-portrait on the camera of a mobile device - it is, first of all, a model of social exchange between people.  The smartphones we use to take selfies and enjoy interactive content are some kind of apogee of digital communication.  We do not part with mobile 24 hours, 7 days a week.  They are constantly with us - in the hands, in the pocket, in the bag - anywhere, the main thing is next.  We buy covers and accessories for them, improve the interface, customizing it to fit our requirements. <br><br>  Now, no one asks a passerby to take a picture of it on a smartphone.  And this is not only because of the presence of the front camera on a mobile device.  When you post a selfie in social networks, you do not just capture the moment.  In fact, you are calling on the environment from your social media to share the significance of the moment with you. <br><br>  Any person who is not in the information vacuum and at least a little versed in social trends, there is no doubt about the relevance of self.  But the <b>interactive content that brands place on their social media is not inferior in meaning to this kind of interaction between the audience.</b>  <b>And to achieve success in social media, you need to proceed from the principles of ‚Äúselfie communication‚Äù.</b>  What is included here? <br><br>  <b>Involvement and feedback</b> <br><br>  By sharing interesting content with others, users express their position on various topics - be it preferences in hobbies, politics, sports, and any other areas.  They form their social image. If a company places an informative and interesting ‚Äúpost‚Äù in its corporate profile, it has every chance that the audience of a socially active person will gradually move into the loyal audience section of the brand.  In other words, organic traffic will grow. <br><br>  The main positive feature of interactive information for companies is that they are divided. <br><br>  In the light of this state of affairs, <b>social media should place special emphasis on such content as polls, polls, videos - that is, on those formats that will not be left unattended and will certainly receive a public response.</b>  The greater the reaction received from the public, the greater the likelihood that your company will be noticed and further interested in your products or services. <br><br>  <b>Brevity</b> <br><br>  For example, now, to express emotions when communicating on social networks, words are used extremely rarely.  Smilies, gif-pictures, abbreviations, hashtags that allow you to express thoughts through fewer words - this is what is in particular demand. <br><br>  Of course, when using this kind of content you should be careful - absolutely not all brands can afford it, especially if the specifics of the company are strictly regulated.  But if you work in the field of culture, art, advertising or any other creative field, then there is no reason to limit yourself to such ‚Äúluxury‚Äù. <br><br>  The main thing is not to overdo it and not completely eliminate ordinary text messages from social communication.  <b>The most ideal option is the alternation of informative and entertaining content</b> .  The user will know that you can turn to your resource for useful information, and just for the sake of pleasant leisure, reading the entertainment material.  So you can reach the maximum audience. <br><br>  <b>Preferences</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúSelf-user‚Äù publishes in their accounts not everything, but only that one way or another will have a positive impact on his social reputation.  To effectively interact with the generation of "self", companies need to post such content that will be in tune with the interests of users.  In order to get to know them, it is enough to keep track of what information prevails in the ‚Äúnews feed‚Äù of users, which public documents they subscribe to, what communities they have and what personal information is indicated in their profiles.  From this picture on social networks you can form a full-fledged image that will set the fundamental criteria for the brand's content strategy regarding the base of potential customers. <br><br>  <b>Analyze your audience in social media, explore their profiles and the quality of social communication - be aware of what your customers love.</b> <br><br>  <u><b>Summing up:</b></u> <br><br>  In the era of the development of modern technologies, when smartphones have become constant companions of people of almost all ages, the usual presence of brands on the Internet is not enough.  Online active society requires the same from companies, so brands need to adapt to the social needs of users and adjust their online image in order to gain a greater number of loyal audiences. <br><br>  Corporate social media should not remain at the same level.  The adoption of interactive formats is the key to their ability to remain relevant in an era of declining concentration and crowded information field and allows you to increase organic traffic. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr10062016"><b>BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303096/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303096/</a></p>
