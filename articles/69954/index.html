A job change is always stress, no matter how trendy the pepper is. <br>  in the previous place you were.  After years of sweet life again, it is necessary <br>  to strain, to understand the heap of code written without you, <br>  to be surprised not by you to make decisions and to be horrified by them is sometimes not easy <br>  unnecessary complexity. <br><br>  We all know how the fan picks up from working in <br>  spaghetti code to add or remove something.  However coming <br>  We are not choosing the first time task for a new place.  With <br>  my reluctance to engage in the analysis of the old bad code I started <br>  fight in several directions: 
      <br>

      1. Psychological: I try not to get angry at the one who wrote it, but <br>  I just understand how it works.  Do not believe in the area <br>  temples from this becomes unusually easy, the face becomes more <br>  friendly and the code looks more understandable. <br><br>  2. Organizational: Apply a short squeeze from GTD: a) collect all <br>  b) reread what you have gathered c) do it.  This direction has <br>  also the technical side, but not about it today.  The main thing with <br>  rereading (clause b) not ‚Äúreturning‚Äù the case without accepting any <br>  intelligible decisions on their further fate.  By the word "deal with it <br>  later, this is quite a clear decision. <br><br>  3. Technical: That's about this direction of my self-instrument you <br>  you can finally read after so long and, as usual, <br>  It turns out, a lengthy entry. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Postsupplement </h4><br><br>  Do not rush to conclusions, I was not mistaken with the title of the article.  PHP is a paradoxical technology.  On it sometimes they write probably the most <br>  incomprehensible code in the world.  The scope of this very "already written" code <br>  present is not possible.  Programmers, too, is not enough.  And what do you imagine <br>  think - all this infantry basically still debug their programs <br>  using the good old echo-debugging.  This one has <br>  a disadvantage that complicates my life, after each session of such <br>  debugging, in order to remove the results of my activity, I revert and <br>  if you need to hold a similar debag session after some time all <br>  need to start from the beginning.  What is there to talk about cases when without <br>  beloved die () just can not do. <br><br>  On Habr√© this tool was already described more than once.  Also at least <br>  its installation was described twice and even XDebug was mentioned once <br>  helper.  However, a simple setup guide all together in one <br>  I did not find the document.  Because without bringing anything new I‚Äôll just become <br>  so an integrator of several documents and articles in order to facilitate <br>  life to all who need it, and their Internet providers. <br><br><h4>  Install XDebug </h4><br><br>  What under windows, what under unix configuration part in general cases <br>  the same: <br><br> <code>zend_extension_ts=full_path_to_xdebug.(so|dll) <br> xdebug.remote_enable=1 <br> xdebug.remote_handler=dbgp <br> xdebug.remote_mode=req <br> xdebug.remote_port=9000 <br> xdebug.remote_host=127.0.0.1 <br> xdebug.idekey=eclipse <br></code> <br>  And you should not care about these parameters, as shown <br>  practice (3 installations on win, mac and ubuntu) it all works without <br>  changes to completely standard installations of these systems.  Is that there <br>  note about mac os x - xdebug lifted from the ports did not want to work <br>  with apache2 + php installed in the same way.  Because there he was <br>  assembled handles one to one as described here <br>  <a href="http://xdebug.org/docs/install">xdebug.org/docs/install</a> in the Compiling section. <br><br><h5>  What is not less important: </h5><br><br>  If you use apache2 and php as a module, then you need to download <br>  hence <a href="http://xdebug.org/download.php">xdebug.org/download.php</a> threaded the build, otherwise (apache <br>  1.3 + php as module or php as CGI) non-threaded build.  That's all that <br>  caused a complication with the installation in my case. <br><br>  As usual we restart apache and check <code>php --re xdebug</code> - if <br>  everything is in order - you will understand it. <br><br><h4>  Install XDebug helper </h4><br><br>  It‚Äôs as simple as putting the usual firefox extension: <br>  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3960">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3960</a> <br><br><h4>  Configure eclipse PDT </h4><br><br>  Feel free to go to Window / Preferences (for Mac Cmd +,) in the filter we drive in <br>  Installed Debuggers.  Choose in the results (who knows how) <br>  PHP / Debug / Installed Debuggers.  And we are going to set up XDebug: <br>  the only thing you need to do is install Accept remote session <br>  (JIT) field at least in localhost or in any that is more relevant to you <br>  except off. <br><br><h4>  The final </h4><br><br>  This is actually all that needs to be done.  Then one big fan in <br>  work.  Open your product in firefox, click on the xdebug icon <br>  helper and do something with your product (once).  Now <br>  switch to PDT and wonder there should be a window offering you <br>  switch to php debug perspective.  And then the matter is small - or <br>  F6, (F6) and sometimes F5 or set breakpoints and walk faster.  At all <br>  Speaking is not tricky. <br><br><h5>  Possible problems </h5><br><br>  (1) Sometimes a debug session does not start. <br><br>  Solved in three steps: 1 clean XDEBUG cookies from your development <br>  domain and if it does not help restart ff and further if everything is <br>  still does not work - restart eclipse (by the way, I have <br>  rarely happens) <br><br>  (2) Sometimes a debug session starts and immediately stops with a drop. <br>  window in eclipse about unexpected session stopping <br><br>  It is necessary to remove all the Expressions in the same window.  It happens <br>  when in the previous session you used the Watch function to <br>  would see the value of some variable or expression. <br><br><h4>  Final chord </h4><br><br>  Please note that all that is proposed to the setting in this article <br>  absolutely free and free.  I wish you all that all that you <br>  really needed to work was either free or affordable;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69954/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69954/</a></p>
