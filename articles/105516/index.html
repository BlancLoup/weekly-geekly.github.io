For casual viewers, <b>Vimeo</b> is a place for short, artistic, video excerpts.  Enter ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù into the search and you will see a pop-up humorous animated video book that broadcasts the entire history of the presidency of George W. Bush.  Enter the same word in the search on YouTube and you will find relevant music videos and excerpts of old news.  Feel the difference?  The site recently announced a new embedded HTML5 standard player, compatible with Apple‚Äôs non-flash-compatible devices, as well as a new Vimeo channel for cable TV set-top boxes Roku, which directs the stream of broadcasted as well as selected programs directly to your TV screen. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.movieclips.com/">Movieclips</a></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a6/95b/17d/1a695b17d8d1eb9549280fbdaeae7b82.png" width="500" height="389"><br>  Need to find a scene from your favorite movie?

But ‚ÄúMovieclips‚Äù is more than just a movie catalog, since it has its own zest.  Using the built-in editor, users can easily create their own video collages.  For a start, we chose ‚ÄúThe Wizard of Oz,‚Äù and in less than 10 minutes, we were able to create a collage.

This transition brought the NBA fans into a state of inquisitive excitement: When did Shaq last play for Los Angeles?  How many years have passed since the last time he played in the champion team?  What place did he occupy among the best players during the entire existence of the League?  <b>Sports-Reference.com</b> is a universal website with answers to all these questions.

After sitting for four hours in a basketball game, the scoreboard is bored.  All you can think about is gossip, heard in the post-game radio broadcast, allegedly the home team player had a fight with his father-in-law in the parking lot.  Together with FoxSports.com, " <b>Yardbarker</b> " closely follows all the screaming news among sports headlines in the morning newspapers.

If the Sports Center of the cable television network of sports and entertainment programs does not support your crazy views, then <b>Total Pro Sports</b> can be a serious alternative to it.  The site proudly offers videos of rare moments, from a Hungarian priest who rides a skateboard, to the best sports-related toys found in Happy Mill from McDonald's.  Among the regular headings are ‚ÄúDaily game bets‚Äù for those who sleep and see how to win big in Vegas, as well as ‚ÄúDaily statistical evening news feed‚Äù for fans of fiction.

With six children - yes, six - one would assume that her design talents would not have gone further diapers.  However, Blair‚Äôs articles on her popular <b>Design Mom</b> website about how design is combined with motherhood show that somehow it can still be combined: a large family, a sharp look and creative abilities.  Read her articles on the art of cutting out fingerprints from paper, updating halls and - we almost forgot - about the birth of her daughter in May.  Just do not hate her for perfection. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/">Serious eats</a></b> <br><img src="http://aiken.ua/userfiles/seriouseats.png" width="500" height="382"><br>  Tired of cooking potato sticks and chicken legs?  Then refer to ‚Äú <b>Serious Eats</b> ‚Äù for people-tested recipes, videos and blog materials about everything you can chew.  Read about oatmeal from Washington, DC, or how to arrange a women's dinner together when the children go to school again, or learn how to cook grilled corn with chili lime butter - yum-yum!  The recipes offered will satisfy even the most discerning gourmets in your house, although, of course, you can first ask for their consent before serving kimchi and cheese sandwiches (on the grill) at the next family picnic. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.babble.com/">Babble</a></b> <br><img src="http://aiken.ua/userfiles/babble.png" width="500" height="382"><br>  This online magazine shows how cool it is to be parents, the whole period from pregnancy to adolescence.  Learn how to choose a child‚Äôs name that will be popular on Facebook and Google, how to prepare for the school year, and how to dress your little girl in daughters fashion in ‚ÄúReal New Jersey Housewives‚Äù (yes okay, you know yourself that you are watching them).  The site "Babble" also has sections for daddies and future daddies, where you can pass the time with advantage, while on cable is advertising. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a></b> <b><br><img src="http://aiken.ua/userfiles/etsy.png" width="500" height="382"><br></b>  This is an online bazaar selling fashionable clothes, toys and home furnishings handmade.  This trade forum is a one-stop shop for every family where they buy home decoration products, clothes for children and toys for adults.  Desperately trying to find a damning gift for relatives who have ‚Äúeverything there‚Äù?  Buy wine glasses "Star Wars".  Looking for something unique in the nursery of your baby already clogged with all sorts of toys on wheels?  How about a copy of a fire truck, a police car, and an ambulance at the pickledpumpkins shop online store?  Often, only one copy of each type of product is offered for sale at a time, so they are quickly sold out.  If this happens, contact the author of the toy by e-mail and he may help you to get the same copy, or to pick something even better. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.sesamestreet.org/">Sesame street</a></b> <br><img src="http://aiken.ua/userfiles/sesame_street.png" width="500" height="382"><br>  Let's face it, the children's program " <b>Sesame Street</b> " is not only educational;  she very quickly becomes a pleasant habit.  This site offers a great opportunity for the magic not to end all day, learning hot details about all the heroes of the show.  Do you know that Abbie Kadabbi's birthday is October 21st and her favorite song is ‚ÄúBaby Spider‚Äù?  Or that the telly monster's best friend is Bear?  Even your children can play educational games - just do not tell them that they are educational - and watch videos with such old acquaintances as Shortbread, Birdies, Vlas and Enik.  During a quiet hour, parents can take a look at the section on how to get a family back on their feet in difficult economic times.  Yes, even <b>Sesame Street</b> can be serious. <br><br><h1>  News and Information </h1><br>  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/"><b>Guardian</b></a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70e/654/318/70e6543185624c518923c41eeceeb71d.jpg" width="500" height="389"><br>  It seems that no other newspaper, which is printed on paper, enjoys so much the full benefits of the digital age as the <b>Guardian</b> .  This British newspaper not only provides original and comprehensive information by posting it on the best newspaper web sites in the world, but it also developed an excellent collection of mobile phone applications that allow you to distribute content across various mobile platforms.  But perhaps the most unusual is that, despite the fact that other British newspapers hid their content behind the payment fence, <b>The Guardian newspaper, on the</b> contrary, maximally revealed itself to the world, offering free access to over 1 million archival articles and providing developers with tools for creating applications that modify the vast information base of the newspaper. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.theonion.com/"><b>The onion</b></a> <br><img src="http://aiken.ua/userfiles/theonion.png" width="500" height="382"><br>  At the time when we were still picking up our weekly print edition, <b>Onion</b> had already developed a multimedia empire of bold ‚Äî and always satirical ‚Äî material.  Respecting its long history, The Onion has been providing its archive for more than twenty years;  At the same time, ‚ÄúThe Onion‚Äù is also active today, presenting 2 times a day a video parodying everything from the American cable television network C-Span to the Today Show morning news program and sports cable television ESPN.  Also, audio podcasts (known as Onion Radio) are posted here every day, as well as some of the funniest slideshows on the Internet.  At the same time, any serious connoisseur of mastery will tell you that among the materials on the entertainment website of the AV Club of The Onion company there are reports exclusively about good art (as well as a collection of comments by erudite users). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.dailybeast.com/"><b>The daily beast</b></a> <br><img src="http://aiken.ua/userfiles/dailybeast.png" width="500" height="382"><br>  It‚Äôs compulsory for any serious news fans to read this website makes not only that level of writers who are going to <b>The Daily Beast</b> on the website of Tina Brown.  Also important is the desire of the publishers of the site to select and highlight the most important headlines of the day, so you can quickly learn about the most basic events.  As a news site, The Daily Beast has a triple function: it defines trends, is a deep analytical center for sharing information about events and views, and also, thanks to a detailed and understandable ‚Äúcheat sheet,‚Äù saves your time well. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/"><b>National geographic</b></a> <br><img src="http://aiken.ua/userfiles/nationalgeographic.png" width="500" height="382"><br>  Before diving into the digital world of the <b>National Geographic</b> site, make sure that you have plenty of free time, because you can go unnoticed for hours in the depths of the global ecosystem and other important environmental issues that other sites simply bypass.  From delightful collections of photographs of natural objects to in-depth sections on the most pressing environmental issues, such as reducing the number of clean water sources and the prospects for creating renewable energy sources, the National Geographic website reveals many of the wonders of nature - as well as the greatest dangers to it.  Moreover, all this is complemented by an impressive array of interactive maps and games.  Feel like you were chained to the desk?  Let the reports from the scene take you from an office building in NYC or a service office in Bentonville, Arkansas, to a research vessel bobbing through the waves in the middle of the Mediterranean.  Just don‚Äôt blame us if you miss a meeting with your marketing team at 3:00. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.wikileaks.org/"><b>Wikileaks</b></a> <br><img src="http://aiken.ua/userfiles/wikileaks.png" width="500" height="382"><br>  Launched in 2006, <b>WikiLeaks</b> , an anonymous forum of leaked secrets, collected over a million documents in its first year alone, creating a reputation as an invaluable resource of public disclosures and public control.  But the site reached great fame on July 25 of this year, providing tens of thousands of documents relating to the war in Afghanistan to the general public, unleashing controversy in the press and among great policy experts on the conduct and prospects of this war.  Many observers, pointing to such military mistakes as their own fire and civilian casualties, also outlined a picture of the conflict, which is much more serious than everyone thought, compared the information leak on July 25 with the publication of the Pentagon‚Äôs documentation during the Vietnam War.  The next morning, WikiLeaks has evolved from a run-down site into the main catalyst of the national news cycle. <br><br><h1>  Finance and Productivity </h1><br>  <b><a href="http://www.mint.com/">Mint</a></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/502/769/c9d/502769c9d2b09848efc327c972b72170.jpg" width="500" height="389"><br>  If you are trying to tighten the belt and accelerate the accumulation of funds for retirement, then you will not be able to help yourself with a better analytical resource on the Internet than <b>Mint.com</b> .  This site will allow you to simultaneously track all major bank accounts: checks, savings, credit cards, loans and investments.  Also, ‚ÄúMint‚Äù will help you break your habits about spending money by providing the ability to track the movement of each dollar.  Due to the fact that billing data is updated every 24 hours, users can freely enter the issue of financial management in their daily routine.  The site can be used absolutely free, but it is also coded to protect all of your confidential financial information. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.wikiinvest.com/">Wikinvest</a></b> <br><img src="http://aiken.ua/userfiles/wikinvest.png" width="500" height="382"><br>  Look at <b>Wikinvest</b> as a continuation of the services of the Mint website for your portfolio of investments.  The site synchronizes its data with the data of brokers for real-time information, so that users can track their relative market characteristics, as well as find material about companies.  Consider that this is a site where user-provided information meets official statistics, something like ‚ÄúWikipedia‚Äù plus ‚ÄúYahoo!  Finance. "  This summer, this site has become even more advanced, announcing its intention to start sending messages, through which news about your investments will be sent directly to your email address, to your <b>iPhone</b> or <b>iPad</b> . <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.stockmapper.com/">Stockmapper</a></b> <br><img src="http://aiken.ua/userfiles/stockmapper.png" width="500" height="382"><br>  Don't just read about the stock exchange;  soak in it.  This is visually possible due to the site ‚Äú <b>StockMapper</b> ‚Äù, which not only provides a table of statistics of all stock shares.  With the help of the so-called "heat map" its columns are painted in different colors in accordance with the relative market value of certain securities.  Designed by Hermann Zhegner of the New York-based design studio TWO-N, the site provides users with the ability to manage heat maps, grouping them according to their geographical region, industry type, alphabetical index, price change, trade volume, and total market value of the company.  Isn't that cool? <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.springpadit.com/">Springpad</a></b> <br><img src="http://aiken.ua/userfiles/springpadit.png" width="500" height="382"><br>  Promising the ability to tag, organize and organize literally everything in your life, the <b>Springpad</b> website really distinguished itself in 2010 by launching a mobile application that allows users to search, catch and organize everything literally on the fly.  Write and save notes, synchronize contact lists, enter and then delete items in the lists of planned cases, determine the location of shops and restaurants, use satellite coordinates to find the nearest outlets, scan bar codes of products that you would like to remember or learn about more.  <b>Springpad</b> is just a big information dump.  In addition to simply storing information, you can then streamline it and easily find what you need using a mobile device, laptop or desktop computer;  the program also synchronizes between different devices. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.wakerupper.com/">Wakerupper</a></b> <br><img src="http://aiken.ua/userfiles/wakerupper.png" width="500" height="382"><br>  <b>Wakerupper</b> is a simple website that provides a complex service.  Enter your phone number, set the date and time, add a message that will be read in an electronic voice on the computer and voila: your number will be dialed just when you have planned.  This service can be used as a universal alarm clock or as a timely reminder, but we like to call it ‚Äúfree permit for release from prison‚Äù most of all.  Going on a first date or premiere to the city and would like to have an escape route just in case?

Groupon has caused the birth of an infinite number of similar group shopping sites, such as LivingSocial, BuyWithMe and Yipit, to name just a few, but none of them have such a global field of action as Groupon. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.gilt.com/">Gilt groupe</a></b> <br><img src="http://aiken.ua/userfiles/gilt.png" width="500" height="382"><br>  On this site, high fashion becomes available even with the current economic downturn.  <b>Gilt Groupe</b> offers three-day discounts on fashion items, gifts, home and travel.        , , ,  $600,    $229.               ,              .       ,          ,  ,      ‚Äî    ,  ,   ,  . <br><br> <b><a href="http://www.renttherunway.com/">Rent the Runway</a></b> <br><img src="http://aiken.ua/userfiles/renttherunway.png" width="500" height="382"><br>      ,        ,          .          ,         . ¬´ <b>Rent the Runway</b> ¬ª    ,            10%     .       ,  ,  ,       ,           .      ,       ,    ,  ¬´Rent the Runway¬ª     .      ,        . <br><br> <b><a href="http://www.stay.com/">Stay</a></b> <br><img src="http://aiken.ua/userfiles/stay.png"><br>        ,           .              ?
