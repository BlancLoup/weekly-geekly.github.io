  <section class="page js-page"><h1>It turns out Verbatim releases gaming mice, and not bad :)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Even with a fairly rich experience in testing various kinds of devices, I was a little surprised to learn that Verbatim also releases various computer programs, among which there are even gaming mice, in addition to storage media! <br><br>  To find out what happened to the company, for about a month I replaced the usual Logitech nano and Razer Diamondback with two wire Verbatim rodents - Rapier V1 and V2. <a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://itmages.ru/picture.php?type=view&amp;amp;id=3751&amp;amp;key=5d6200" alt="Mouse Verbatim Rapier V1."><br><img src="http://itmages.ru/picture.php?type=view&amp;amp;id=3753&amp;amp;key=f583cd" alt="Mouse Verbatim Rapier V1. Left view."><br><img src="http://itmages.ru/picture.php?type=view&amp;amp;id=3754&amp;amp;key=247b0d" alt="Mouse Verbatim Rapier V1. View from above."><br><img src="http://itmages.ru/picture.php?type=view&amp;amp;id=3752&amp;amp;key=5856a5" alt="Mouse Verbatim Rapier V1 in hand."><br>  What can I say about the first "Rapier" (by the way, an interesting move with the name - they say, deliver with the help of precise piercing blows at the enemy;)?  I liked her more than the second, and that says it all.  I can‚Äôt do anything with myself, but even with almost equal performance characteristics, V1 is ahead of V2 in its ergonomic characteristics.  The first model is not only that looks more aggressive (and this is for the gaming manipulator, in my opinion, one of the main factors affecting the progress), but also lies much more comfortable in the hand: look at the shape ‚Äî there is not only a depression under the thumb, but also under the index.  At first, such a move with placing the working finger between the scroll wheel (which is located on the left and not in the center) and the ‚Äúridge‚Äù of the mouse seems rather strange - every now and then reflexively looking for a scroll on the right - but by the end of the first day of the active game you start to get used to it.  For the rest, almost nothing unusual was noticed in the mouse: under the thumb in the recess there are two traditional buttons ‚ÄúForward‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, which can be programmed as you like with the bundled software (macros, user input emulation with keyboards, etc., and all this is stored in the device‚Äôs memory).  In addition, in the same recess there is a rather convenient switch of resolution and mouse modes.  Swinging it from side to side, you can change the sensitivity of the sensor, and pressing - to move from the usual (multimedia) mode to the game.  Where the scroll wheel is usually located, the V1 has a small programmable key that ‚Äúeats away‚Äù a portion of the space at the right button.  However, what do I tell the obvious things :)?  In the photos, and so everything is visible. <br><br><img src="http://itmages.ru/picture.php?type=view&amp;amp;id=3755&amp;amp;key=194bbf" alt="Mouse Verbatim Rapier V2."><br><img src="http://itmages.ru/picture.php?type=view&amp;amp;id=3757&amp;amp;key=878f8f" alt="Mouse Verbatim Rapier V2. Left view."><br><img src="http://itmages.ru/picture.php?type=view&amp;amp;id=3758&amp;amp;key=9b7381" alt="Mouse Verbatim Rapier V2. View from above."><br><img src="http://itmages.ru/picture.php?type=view&amp;amp;id=3756&amp;amp;key=2ceecf" alt="Mouse Verbatim Rapier V2 in hand."><br>  Now look at the Rapier V2 - mouse antipode V1.  It seems that the device came to us from the past, the year of commercials from 2005.  My subjective palm on the body of this shape and size (too wide, the anatomical depressions are barely noticeable) lays poorly.  It turns out the following short logical chain: the device is inconvenient ‚Üí spinning in the game is more difficult ‚Üí kill more often ‚Üí everyone asks what happened :) The thought of teleportation from the past is also confirmed by the coloring: the device is flashy-red, and in the yard something is 2009 black color in combination with carbon fiber weave;) The placement of buttons is also, in my opinion, less logical than the first model.  The sensitivity switch, which, in general, is quite in demand during the game, sits on the back of the mouse, where to reach really uncomfortable.  Next to this toggle switch there is a key, which is responsible for changing the modes - I cannot complain about anything, because it is used once or twice a day.  In the same place, on the upper part of the body, a scroll wheel is located in the traditional place, which is surrounded on both sides by rubberized main buttons.  Add.  the ‚ÄúForward‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù keys are located in the same place as that of the V1, and they can also be programmed.

      By the way, I almost forgot: both mice have a special two-color indicator showing the level of sensitivity and the selected mode, as well as niches in the bottom, where you can insert five loads of 4.5 grams in weight each.  And only here, perhaps, the V2 has an advantage.  This model of osteks for loads two (front and rear), and it turns out you can adjust not only the weight of the manipulator, but also its balancing. <br><br>  And the performance characteristics, as I said at the beginning, are almost the same in rodents.  The resolution of their sensors can be changed from 400 to 3200 dpi, they withstand acceleration up to 20 G (here, of course, it‚Äôs not that they can physically withstand it, but the ability of the sensor to work in such conditions).  The only difference between them is only in working speeds and frame rates.  The V1 is 1.6 m / s and 7800 k / s, respectively, and the V2 is 1.1 m / s and 9600 k / s. <br><br>  Like this.  To be honest, I am somewhat surprised by how successful the V1 model turned out, because this is actually the company's first attempt to enter a new market for itself.  I would compare it to the quality of performance with devices Logitech, for example.  And V2 ... I don't know, maybe someone will like it, but personally I think the model is not very successful, despite some successful solutions. <br><br>  Oh yes!  And the prices, of course.  For the first "Rapier" over the hill they are asking for $ 60, and for the second - $ 50. We, as I understand, are not selling them yet.  In any case, I did not see it in retail, and I did not find it on the network right now. <br><br>  ¬© Photo by <a href="http://snoepje.ru/">Yulia Butenko</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57308/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57308/</a></p>
