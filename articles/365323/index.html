  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mio Alpha 2 Heart Rate Monitor Review: Pulse Only, Hardcore Only</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In January 2007, Steve Jobs destroyed the stylus and physical keyboards directly from the scene, proving that these tools are absolutely not needed to control smartphones.  The rest of the market was enough for three years to agree with the founder of Apple and go to capacitive displays, leaving feathers and keypads in the past.  With heart rate monitors - a similar story: until recently it seemed that a precise belt needed on a chest was necessary for an accurate measurement of heart rate, but Mio devices refute this theory.  Bracelet, screen, sensor - that's all you need to measure the pulse with ECG accuracy.  Sources project light onto the skin, thanks to which the sensor monitors changes in the blood vessels, which makes it possible to forget about uncomfortable chest sensors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8a/d8e/bbe/c8ad8ebbe3494dec8b0bb7128e2a7610.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/pulsometr-mio-alpha-2/">Mio Alpha 2 was</a> presented at CES 2015, and its announcement was preceded by the triumph of the first Mio Alpha and Mio Fuse.  At the moment in the lineup Mio five models: Mio Link, Mio Velo, Mio Fuse and two Mio Alpha.  The second Alpha, which came to us for the test, is the most advanced device of the company: if you count the ticks on the comparison page of bracelets and heart rate monitors, it becomes clear that only the universal Fuse bracelet can compete with it (but its battery holds two times less, and the timer absent altogether). <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Equipment </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6b/3b1/233/c6b3b12337ad4a1284e49dc112f42519.png"><br><br>  The Mio Alpha 2 box is compact ‚Äî there's nothing inside that could take up a lot of space.  The heart rate monitor comes with a special docking station, which in terms of charging method resembles the Apple Watch solution: the station is mounted on the back of the Alpha 2 case and connected to the network using a cable.  Immediately it is necessary to clarify the time of the device: up to a day in the heart rate monitor mode (of course, continuously, with pauses will be smaller) and up to three months in the mode of ordinary electronic hours. <br><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  Mio does not deny that all the devices of the company are created either for those who will wear them exclusively for training, or for those who prefer a sporty style.  ‚ÄúSporty looking‚Äù is what this phenomenon is called by western observers.  The Alpha 2 case is made of durable plastic (yellow / black colors), mineral glass doesn‚Äôt feel fragile either (although we didn‚Äôt have crash tests), and the wide strap is pierced with dozens of small holes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/025/005/4a1/0250054a1c9b4e4aba02de3a4949c1f1.png"><br><br>  This is probably done to aerate the skin, but in practice, after using Alpha 2, there are noticeable marks on the wrist that disappear within a few minutes.  The cause of the "relief" is that the heart rate monitor should be as close to the skin as possible - this increases the accuracy of the readings.  Fortunately, silicone is so soft that it‚Äôs almost impossible to rub your hand.  Of course, both the case and the strap do not cause allergies - this is additionally spelled out in the specifications.  The protocol of water protection is also indicated there: in Alpha 2 you can wash your hands and not be afraid of rain, but in a shower stall and a pool it is better to do without a heart rate monitor. <br><br><h4>  Functionality </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/417/aca/3fe/417aca3fe1fe45659f6e25371cf3eaba.png"><br><br>  Alpha 2 should be treated exactly like a sports gadget: even though it is synchronized with iOS / Android devices, no notifications will come here.  The screen is activated by double tapping - it is convenient for both the user (the gesture is easy to remember) and the battery.  By default, the clock is displayed (12/24 format), but from the menu you can quickly switch to the heart rate measurement mode.  The screen itself is sufficiently contrast so that the indicators are visible in any light. <br><br>  On the sides of the screen are two keys.  The left one is responsible for choosing the mode, the right one is for adjusting the exercises and programs.  In addition to the pulse, Mio Alpha 2 calculates steps, calories burned, average movement rate, current speed and distance covered.  All indicators are first stored in the memory of the device, it is enough to register 25 hours of training.  Time classes can be set by timer - when the countdown reaches the final mark, you will be notified by sound and light.  It is curious that the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/mio-fuse/">Mio Fuse</a> bracelet additionally has a vibration motor, but it does not have a timer for which a buzzing mechanism would be very useful. <br><br><h4>  application </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/642/991/f2d/642991f2dbb2435aac1365c7accd0f51.png"><br><br>  The work of Mio Alpha 2 is determined by the program Mio Go: this software is for the two most popular mobile platforms, and the owners of WP-devices will have to choose something else.  The application sets goals (to pass / run some distance), manually adjust the type of activity (from the ‚Äúhike‚Äù mode to the ‚Äúmountain bike‚Äù option), save history (including peak values) and display personal progress.  Mio Go is concise and functional: in principle, there is everything that is required for effective training. <br><br>  Be sure to take into account that people who are tolerant to other programs work in Mio: Alpha 2 without excesses synchronizes with MapMyRun, Strava and Wahoo.  However, due to the lack of GPS in the heart rate monitor, you will have to run (or ride a bicycle) with a smartphone in your pocket. <br><br><h4>  Training </h4><br>  Before starting classes, Mio Alpha 2 asks to enter height, weight, gender and year of birth, as well as select the maximum allowable pulse value.  Standard workouts consist of five phases, each of which is marked by its own backlight color: you can determine on the fly that you have moved from the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù zone to the ‚Äúyellow‚Äù one.  The most difficult stage is the ‚Äúred‚Äù zone: in the annex it is marked with the word ‚Äúmaximum‚Äù.  There, the heart is loaded in full, but immediately after it comes rest.  The separation into five phases is a very practical way to evaluate your current form and compare it with previous values. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31d/1de/ab4/31d1deab456d411285102bcca5e079f4.png"><br><br>  We can speak about the quality of measurements only on the basis of our own observations.  A couple of times in an hour of running, the sensor can move away from the skin if you tightened the strap not hard enough, in which case the pulse graph drops sharply down.  These indicators should not be taken seriously: if the pulses of the heart rate monitor are next to the skin, the measurements are accurate.  The error is minimal and compared to the standard pulse measurement, when we put a finger to the vein for 10 seconds, count the blows, and then multiply by 6. Due to the lightweight body, Mio Alpha 2 is almost not felt on the wrist - this is a clear plus, if we talk about comfort running. <br><br><h4>  Conclusions, competitors, price </h4><br>  The cost of Mio Alpha 2 - 11 990 rubles.  Due to the lack of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù features, the price seems a bit overpriced, but we must understand that the Alpha 2 is a sports one, not an everyday gadget.  A serious drawback is a dash in the ‚ÄúGPS‚Äù column, but, as mentioned above, it is solved with the help of a smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/47a/47b/a5d/47a47ba5dfbd406da9c74fc5eaabfdfa.png"><br><br>  Alpha 2's main competitor is the Basis Peak smart watch.  They show notifications, monitor sleep, look like regular watches and are not afraid of diving into water.  Choose based on your own requirements: if you need a daily accessory with a pulse sensor, then Peak should be purchased, and if the goal is to find a convenient gadget for training in the gym or on the street, it will be difficult to choose a device more ergonomic than the Alpha 2. <br><br><h4>  Order Mio Alpha 2 </h4><br>  During the week (until April 7), all Geektimes readers can purchase the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/pulsometr-mio-alpha-2/">Mio Alpha 2 heart rate monitor</a> with a <b>10% discount</b> by entering the "GEEKS" promotional code when placing an order. <br><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/pulsometr-mio-alpha-2/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4a/628/ea3/d4a628ea30b1403b844dbc1e4e2b44c0.png"></a> <br><br>  Author: <a href="https://twitter.com/gorodnitskiy">Pavel Gorodnitsky</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365323/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365323/</a></p>
