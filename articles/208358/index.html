  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Turning your smartphone into a gaming console Dendy, Sega, PS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good time of the day, habrazhiteli, <br><br>  In this post, I would like to tell you how I turned my Android-based smartphone into a game console Dendy, Sega, PS.  It cost me $ 21.  If it is interesting to someone that yes as - I ask under kat. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/35b/a9d/943/35ba9d94380b2f90e478fe50f8e76dea.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Preamble </h1><br>  On Habr√© already skipped the topic that Samsung has released a GamePad for mobile phones.  Here is a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/206812/">link to the topic</a> .  The price of such a device, as stated in the topic, is $ 146.  For some it is a lot, for someone it is not, but we also need to know which games to play on this controller.  Personally, I'm not sure that it will be convenient to play with the joystick in Angry Birds.  Yes, and many games for smartphones are created specifically for the touch screen.

      Also on Habr√©, the topics about the Android-based game console slid: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/196542/">Nvidia Shield</a> .  This is a portable console, which according to the characteristics is similar to a fairly powerful smartphone. <br><br>  In principle, the game console Nvidia Shield and Samsung's GamePad with a smartphone are one and the same.  The Chinese thought the same thing and created their own joystick that can turn your smartphone into a portable console. <br><br><h1>  Gamepad iPega </h1><br>  I ordered the iPega gamepad on AliExpress for $ 21.  The gamepad has flown in without a box, which is why such a low price.  Model gamepad PG-9017.  The gamepad has a built-in battery and is charged by micro usb.  I have not completely discharged the gamepad, so I can not say how much it is enough. <br>  Here are a couple of pictures of the controller: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc7/ccc/c32/fc7cccc32269f055df626394ee103002.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/638/c6f/20c/638c6f20ce3031eb923aa41e47239f4b.jpg"><br><br>  The controller has no problems connected to my smartphone via Bluetooth.  To pair the device, you had to press "X" + "HOME".  The light bulb on the controller flashes quickly and at this point you can search for the controller on the smartphone.  In the gamepad there is a mount-latch for a smartphone.  In this model of controller, you can insert a phone up to 5-5.5 inches.  In the mount is a spring and it stretches, so some manage to insert into the mount phone with a diagonal of 5.5 inches, but I would advise to limit to 5 inches.  Somewhere I came across a modification of this gamepad for phones with a diagonal greater than 5 inches.  By searching "Android gamepad" on AliEpress, you can find a gamepad with the same functionality as the iPega, but with the XBOX controller design (and, therefore, +2 additional control buttons).  After the gamepad is connected, you need to think about what to play. <br><br><h2>  Gamepad games and joystick responsiveness </h2><br>  For games developed for Android, I don‚Äôt see much sense in using the controller: the touchscreen does a great job somewhere, visibility is needed somewhere.  To test the controller, I installed the emulator Dendy and Sega.  In the emulator, you can customize each button and remove the virtual keyboard.  I already tried to play Super Mario, Earthworm Jim and Mortal Kombat. <br><br>  A gamepad in games behaves just like a regular game console joystick.  The response time of the buttons is tolerable, the crosspiece works fine, nothing creaks.  The gamepad is quite easy, especially without a smartphone.  In Earthworm Jim, I could shoot diagonally with the help of the cross, although some of the reviews say that they aren‚Äôt able to properly press up / down and sideways.  I have not tried to play other emulators: PS, GameBoy, etc.  I have a Nexus 4 with factory firmware, Android 4.4.2 is on board.  In the description of the device it is written that Android 2.3 or iOS is required, without specifying the version. <br><br>  I made a short video review for those.  who wants to see a gamepad at work: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/bZk-IteffqE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhigmNY4QfTotXgahAo1L88eELE5rg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A couple of links to emulators: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.johnemulators.johnneslite">John NES Lite</a> - Dendy emulator. </li><li>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.bubblezapgames.supergnes_lite">SuperGNES Lite</a> - Super Nintendo emulator. </li><li>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dca.halsafar.genesisdroid">GENPlusDroid</a> - Sega emulator. </li></ul><br>  The list of emulators can be expanded, but I used only these.  Games for the emulator is not difficult to find on the Internet. <br><br><h1>  findings </h1><br>  Honestly, the gamepad iPega is the best addition to a smartphone for $ 21.  Damn it, phone case at the same price.  And emulators for a smartphone allow you to remember your childhood and play good old games.  In addition, it is possible to save the passage of the game (especially for Dendy and Sega, this was true in our time).  Of course, it would be naive to assume that the device is without drawbacks, especially for such a price, but I cannot say that there are significant drawbacks.  Yes, the XBOX joystick is more pleasant to hold in your hand, yes, PS games may lack two buttons, but you can put up with these drawbacks or buy a newer gamepad model when you decide that you obviously need it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/208358/">https://habr.com/ru/post/208358/</a></p>
