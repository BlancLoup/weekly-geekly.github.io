  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thanks to 3D printing, a paralyzed woman can walk again</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Doctors told Amanda Boxtel that she would never walk again, but the developers of her new exoskeleton had their own opinion <br><br>  In 1992, the body of Amanda Boxtel from the belt and below paralyzed paralysis.  The cause of the injury was an accident while skiing.  But 22 years later, thanks to an innovative robotic suit, which was created by 3D Systems and EksoBionics specialists using 3D printing technology, the woman learned to get up and move on her own again. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/017/2f9/20a/0172f920addcb242c38b75662fd5db7d.jpg" width="300" alt="image"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The new exoskeleton is the first of its kind.  The device was made specifically for Boxtel.  Engineers from 3D Systems scanned the woman‚Äôs body, digitizing the contours of her spine, thighs, and legs.  The obtained data helped to create a customized exoskeleton framework, which was later merged with a variety of actuators (mechanical drives) and a control system developed by EksoBionics specialists.  The result, according to representatives of 3D Systems, was the first in the world "custom-made" exoskeleton.

The problem is that paralyzed people are often unable to know that bruises appear on their bodies simply because they cannot feel pain.  This is very dangerous: unnoticed bruises and abrasions can become infected. <br><br>  In addition, since 3D printing allows you to create very small parts, engineers were able to design an exoskeleton so that skin of Boxtel could breathe: that is, the problem of excessive local perspiration was eliminated. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a93/487/dc6/a93487dc625fe4ec8f7fc47e9b96d013.png" width="400" alt="image"></div><br><br>  The process of creating a robotic suit "to order" lasted about three months.  Moreover, the engineers used a completely standard installation for 3D printing: now anyone can <a href="https://3dcubis.autokassir.ru/%3Fr%3Dac%26id%3D18%26lg%3Dru">buy a 3D printer of</a> this kind with finance. <br><br>  It all started after Scott Summit, Senior Director of Functional Design of 3D Systems, and Avi Reichental, CEO, met with Boxtel during the latter‚Äôs visit to EksoBionics.  By that time, EksoBionics experts had already created an exoskeleton designed for people with various injuries, and Boxtel, along with nine other volunteers, was engaged in testing it.  Reichental was very impressed with what he saw, but noted that the exoskeleton was not ‚Äúfitted‚Äù for a specific person: for fastening its parts on the body of the tester, adjustable velcro straps were used, which did not allow to achieve perfect fixation. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0fe/712/81a/0fe71281a3e002c6231c193177dd92f8.png" width="600" alt="image"></div><br><br>  After that, 3D Systems specialists joined the project.  Using a special 3D scanning system, the Summit team created a customized exoskeleton with a unique body geometry.  ‚ÄúWhen a robotic suit becomes the only tool that allows you to walk, you need to make it as comfortable as possible,‚Äù said Summit about Boxtel and its exoskeleton, ‚ÄúThus, our goal was to improve the quality of the connection between man and machine: it was necessary to make them practically one piece‚Äù . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhCAkUMQ5GA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi5cgbB_6bLBlZm5lVhefpZkzIuYg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213273/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213273/</a></p>
