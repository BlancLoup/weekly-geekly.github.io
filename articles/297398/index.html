      <i>1. Dear Svetlana!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We are glad to inform you that we do not have time today to sign the contract, which we promised to send.</i>  <i>The fact is that we decided to work it out carefully and did not have time to discuss all the details.</i>  <i>We will try to finish work on it this week and send it to you for signing.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Ivan,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>manager of the company "X".</i> <br><br>  <i>2. Dear Svetlana Evgenievna!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Due to the delay and discussion of all clauses of the contract, which concerns the completion of the transaction with the company "Y", we extend the process of signing the contract.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Will report changes during the week.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Respectfully,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Ivan Vyacheslavovich Dill,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>X Company Manager</i> <br>  <i>The company "X" is the market leader in the technology of growing greens and regularly supplies to the CIS countries 135 tons of parsley ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>8 (999) 0008888</i> <br><br>  <i>3. Svetlana, hello!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Today we had to send you all the materials that relate to the contract, but do not have time to finish the discussion today.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Apologize.</i>  <i>All materials will be ready by Friday, October 2nd.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I'll call you a little later.</i>  <i>My phone: 899999999</i> <i><br></i>  <i>All the best!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Ivan,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>X Company Manager</i> <br>  <b>Compare?</b> <br><br>  So, if we compare these letters, we will find flaws in each of them.  Excessive clericals in the letter number 2, some pop-up "wrong" in the letter number 1, the third looks good.  But the best thing would certainly be to call.  And just discuss it with a person.  So this is just a demonstration of the fact that sometimes it is worth refusing letters.  And just chat :) <br><br>  But the third letter is nothing - it's simple and everything is clear, agree! </h6><br><br><h5>  <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/30-primerov-ceplyayushih-soprovoditelnyh-pisem/">/ Catch 30+ examples of excellent cover letters! /</a> </h5><br><br><h4>  // Netiket </h4><br><h6>  1. Dear, Dear, Dear - any toast at a wedding can begin this way, but not every letter.  The greeting is obligatory, but it is better to start with ‚ÄúGood afternoon / evening‚Äù, and ideally with ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù. <br>  2. ‚ÄúA reminder of the need to create a team to discuss issues ...‚Äù.  On the word ‚Äúnecessity‚Äù we already lost our addressee and our letter went to surf the spam or simply sunk into eternity of non-reading. <br>  3. ‚ÄúImportant‚Äù - this is a mark that should not be put because of its uselessness.  Absolute. <br>  4. Letters - this form of communication is not as fast as a telephone conversation.  Do not expect to respond immediately and do not write next, ‚ÄúI am waiting for comments / response.‚Äù <br>  5. You too are mistaken when you click on ‚ÄúReply ALL‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúReply‚Äù.  This is epic, so once again check. <br>  6. Politeness should not be excessive.  Wish a good day, all the best, or say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù is necessary only in cases where it is necessary.  Do not abuse.  Thank. <br>  7. Rather, include your contacts in the signature, if so far they are not there.  On the other hand, if your signature contains also a listing of your position, duties and other things - whoa, whoa, reduce! <br>  8. The structure of the letter should be verified: who, why, what the recipient will receive, the question, contacts and ‚Äúall the best‚Äù. <br>  9. Read the letter and cut it down mercilessly, change complex structures to simple ones.  Verbs! <br>  10. Letters should not provoke discussions - we ask the question specifically.  No ‚Äúshu-shu!‚Äù. <br>  11. Check your literacy (another plus in favor of reduction and simplification). <br>  12. PLEASE ANSWER URGENTLY!  - Caps Lock is unlikely to someone once helped better convey their message and is suitable only for quarrels in social networks. <br>  13. If you are writing to a colleague or about a meeting, then you can write ‚ÄúLunch at one o'clock?‚Äù In the subject line of the letter - your letter is guaranteed to be opened and it will also respond so quickly! <br>  14. Long paragraphs, no matter how important the information is in them, no one will read. <br>  15. Say no to loudly to different fonts that sometimes seem interesting.  Arial or Times New Roman - this is etiquette. </h6><br><br><h4>  // Help yourself </h4><br><h6>  16. Applications that weigh like a movie from your wedding are very difficult to open.  It is better to fill them somewhere, than to send to the poor colleague who then will open them with the help of the mobile Internet and that's it. <br>  17. Remind about how the project is moving regularly - do not disappear for a long time, directly organize information about your work and report when there is progress or vice versa (immediately !!!).  But, of course, here a sense of proportion can also play a cruel joke. <br>  18. Do not try to solve an urgent issue with a letter.  Call! <br>  19. Do not send letters to a colleague who sits across the table from you - communicate :) <br>  20. Instead of writing a huge instruction or information letter with a bunch of important facts, make an entry in a blog, Wikipedia, finally in a document for general use. <br>  21. Do not swear in letters.  It will always remain in the memory of the mail server and will be used against you. <br>  22. Do not forget that all the letters and chains that they are (sometimes shackles) can be the reason that you have not seen or missed something, so you need to scroll through everything. <br>  23. Do not ask questions, the answer to which you can google. <br>  24. Write what you need from the addressee.  Better in the first line. <br>  25. Do not keep love correspondence from the same mailbox.  Oh, it threatens you this sooner or later failure.  (Like the story we once told, remember? The guy in response to a message from HR that he was hired, accidentally sent a selfie naked. The poor girl called the police!) </h6><br><br><h4>  // A question of professionalism </h4><br><h6>  26. Always.  Always answer the boss's letters. <br>  27. Do not interfere with business, work and personal. <br>  28. It is advisable not to answer questions outside working hours - you yourself will regret it when the letters fall in at 3 am. <br>  29. Before you send a letter worth it sober up. <br>  30. Short letters may seem too rough, and long letters too sweet - draw a clear line and read them! <br>  31. Customers and team members are different people, do not interfere with them and do not send the same letters. <br>  32. Do not respond to emails when you are angry.  We count to 10. <br>  33. Never lie, if you nakosyachili. </h6><br><br><h4>  // Productivity </h4><br>
<h6>  34. Cut down all useless mailings and get rid of ‚Äú1200 unread‚Äù. <br>  35. It is better not to use applications that show that a letter has arrived.  It is distracting.  Just check your mail at the beginning of every hour.  And you will be happy. <br>  36. Email is not a way to slow down work. </h6><br><br><h4>  // Security </h4><br><h6>  37. Do you still send passwords by mail?  Oh, sit down, ‚Äútwo‚Äù! <br>  38. No information about money, salary ... <br>  39. Ask in the end to install yourself AdBlock.  Or do something. <br>  40. Sending databases by mail is also a bad idea. <br>  41. Email Management <br>  42. Always it is worth re-checking the address to which you send the letter, do not expect to auto-complete. <br>  43. Do not close Outlook before the letter is sent (unless, of course, using this method). <br>  44. Check if you can open the applications you send. <br>  45. You forgot what and in which folder you have. <br>  46. ‚Äã‚ÄãWriting is not art.  Write easier! </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297398/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297398/</a></p>
