There are sites such as <a href="http://cmslist.ru/">cmslist.ru</a> , <a href="http://smagazine.ru/">smagazine.ru</a> , and just the number of CMS for the last half year, the year has increased by an order.  Actually, the analysis of this situation is a completely different tale.  But building an ideal CMS or some higher principle of building one that aggregates most of the advantages and minimum of flaws in itself is a question, the answer to which is interesting, probably, not only for me, but for many developers. <br><br>  <b>Preamble.</b>  <b>(Part 1)</b> <br>  CMS - Content Management System [ <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC">WiKi</a> ], based on its name, says a lot already :) <br><br>  Here you can probably immediately assume the division of CMS based on the content used: <br>  plain text; <br><ul><li>  structured data (news etc.); </li><li>  A large number of structured data (product catalog with characteristics), combined with common data (reference books). </li></ul><br>  Further, delving into the expansion of work with users, we can assume the need for additional services - registration (personal account), an online store, the ability to leave comments, create polls, forum etc.

      A few words about typical terms of use and types of customers.  I'm not afraid of such a division of customers into two large groups such as: <br><ul><li>  those who want a website and management tool, but have little idea how all this should be; </li><li>  and those who use CMS in full; </li></ul><br>  This is a seemingly stupid and unformatted division, but let's see in more detail what is meant, for it is not easy to express the idea clearly in two words: <br><ul><li>  There are such customers who have a lot of information for the site, management of this information is planned by the secretaries or by the developer, development of new functionality is not planned, and if it is planned, then at any expense by CMS developers. </li><li>  And there are, for example, those who have specialists in their own power to fill, maintain, develop. </li></ul><br>  In general, such a division of customers causes another type of CMS division, namely: <br>  ease of implementation and further development; <br>  or ease of management, in the form of easy writing of content, and nafig all add.  modules, for difficult; <br><br>  Well and, the most, unobvious division according to the type of admin device and the CMS engine itself.  CMS representing the formation of the page on the fly, by assembling a template by means of a scripting language from the database; <br>  and a number of CMS based on the publication of pages in static html; <br><br>  <b>Total:</b> <br>  The question, gentlemen habracheloveki, whether there is a place to be all of the above and whether further consideration of the prerequisites for the creation and options for building some kind of ideal CMS will be interesting? <br><br>  <b>UPD0:</b> <br>  The absurdity of the ideal was clear before writing, it is clear that without the transformation of a thought form into a result, the ideal is doubtful.  However, in my opinion, such a concentration of thought that would not eventually turned out to be garbage still needs to be achieved, but this is already a philosophy. <br><br>  But, the ideal was presented to me as an aggregation of the most optimal solutions, and first of all for the developer, it was with this that the habra community tried to clarify the approaches and implementations, the habra community as the developer community.  And the comments from the customer turned out in the comments, offensively ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51820/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51820/</a></p>
