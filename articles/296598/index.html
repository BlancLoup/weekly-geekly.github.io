  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 simple tips to increase remote work productivity</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day.  Today I work remotely and build two companies, in which also each employee chooses whether to come to work in the office or work remotely.  Therefore, without extra admission, I want to share with you a dozen simple rules that help me to be more productive and a little happier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f4/c94/cef/4f4c94cefa114d1098b88b14f40abec1.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  <b>Turn off notifications on your smartphone.</b>  The first step towards successful remote work is concentration.  I turned off notifications from Gmail.  Initially, I couldn‚Äôt even imagine such a thing, I thought that the sooner I answered the letter, the better and more productive I worked.  In fact, each incoming letter only distracts from the really important task that leads the company forward.  Now I check mail once in the morning and once in the evening.  Moreover, if there is an important task, then I first carry it out and only then take up the parsing of mail.  Notifications from other applications are also disabled, I choose the time when I read news and feeds of friends, and not when the application reminds me of it. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Postpone interesting content for later.</b>  During the day there is a huge amount of interesting materials.  And Megamind is also to blame.  If I find the material interesting, then I send it to a separate bookmark folder, I have it called ‚ÄúRead‚Äù.  I really do not like to read from the screen, so from it all the most interesting is sent to my Kindle with the help of the ‚ÄúSend to Kindle‚Äù plugin.  In one click, the article appears in my e-book which is always with me.  I do not distract from work and do not miss anything interesting.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
    </li><li>  <b>Music is much more fun to work with.</b>  The main thing that she did not distract and did not come to the fore.  I like the best instrumental or quiet songs in a language unfamiliar to me (or English).  It is not distracting and makes the execution of tasks not so boring.  This helps me our domestic Yandex Radio. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Break complex tasks.</b>  It is very important, when performing complex tasks, to break them into small ones so that you can estimate how much the task has been completed and how much is left.  A simple example.  We need new advertising flyers for mailing: <br><ul><li>  Come up with content flyer </li><li>  Write a design specification </li><li>  Find a designer to design a flyer. </li><li>  Choose a printing house for printing at a cost / time ratio. </li><li>  Pick up or send a courier for ready-made flyers. </li><li>  Give the materials to the marketing department to send. </li></ul><br>  And now the task is broken down into exact subtasks and it should not be kept in mind, it should just be performed step by step.  So the task seems simple. <br><br></li><li>  <b>The task must be one.</b>  Do not try to perform several tasks at once, do not need to be sprayed.  Do not even try to think about them.  If another one appears during the task, just write it down and forget about it right away.  For her, the time will come.  To perform several tasks at the same time means not to perform any. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Remove all that creates information noise.</b>  If the work is related to the Internet, then be sure to install any ad blocker in the browser.  This will further focus your attention on the task and you will be less distracted by what you are definitely interested in.  And today, advertising knows what you are interested in, so each banner is your time spent, it is better to remove it in advance.  For example, it might be ABP for Chrome. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Place for work and leisure.</b>  If you work from home, it is very important to separate the workplace from the place of rest and sleep.  If there is a separate desktop - great.  On my own experience, I can say that brewing a cup of coffee and sitting down at a table is much more productive than starting a working day without getting out of bed with a laptop in your lap.  In this case, be sure to dress up, do not make Facebook or conquer the world while sitting in shorts.  It disciplines. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Be happy</b>  This is already a trivial pledge for a productive and happy person.  But I do not watch TV, do not read the news.  Rather, I read the news, but they are not about war, terrorism and death.  They are about high technologies, new start-ups and everything related to my work sphere - only what interests me.  The news that the guys from Silicon Valley came up with something new, while the other guys from St. Petersburg sold their startup for $ 7 million inspiring and do not spoil the mood, even on the contrary raise it.  I only read news on Twitter, I myself choose the one who interests me and intends to block any policy.  I can get into it when I am 55, but not now when I want to create.  In my opinion, Twitter is the most operational and convenient channel for receiving information. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Stay healthy</b>  When fully loaded with work it is difficult to imagine that it will be possible to allocate 3 hours per week to sports.  But in practice, the most difficult thing to start here.  After any physical exertion you will do something much faster over what you have been fighting for so long.  The head really needs a sport.  Good physical condition is directly dependent on the ability to concentrate and solve problems.  It will be more than enough to go in for sports twice a week, for example, on Mondays and Fridays during the day.  Moreover, remote work easily allows us to plan our time and come to the hall when there are not so many people there.  And if there is no money for the hall, then you can just run along the street.  This is no worse. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Turn on airplane mode on your smartphone after 23:00, get enough sleep.</b>  I do not think that today the phones emit dangerous signals, no, not for that.  I just incredibly often caught myself for the fact that it was already deep night, and I leaf through social network tapes for the third time, Why?  Unclear.  In order to concentrate and solve a difficult task, it will play an important role in how you slept. </li></ol><br><br>  By working remotely you are your own boss and boss.  Treat yourself stricter.  The more collected you are in work, the faster you solve your tasks and you have plenty of time for family, hobbies and rest. <br><br>  Work productively and solve interesting problems.
