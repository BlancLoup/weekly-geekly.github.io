  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Legal basis for data and business protection when hosting servers in a data center</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A lot of articles are devoted to information security, data protection at the technical level, but people and business sometimes in the desire to replay everyone replay themselves.  In order to protect your data more reliably, and sometimes due to ignorance or unwillingness to think a few moves ahead, arrange the services of placing and renting servers in data centers to fake companies or third parties.  Actually, the writing of this note has pushed me for 24 hours already lasting removal of the brain to me and all our employees.  And this situation is not the first time arises. <br><br>  One of the Horns and Hoofs LLC, possibly in order to protect its data, issued an agreement with our data center not for itself, but for its own employee, or incoming system administrator.  Whether it is possible to do this for any other purpose is unknown to me. <br><br>  Now Horns and Hooves, LLC appears to have broken up badly with the person on whom the servers are decorated.  This man asked to turn off the servers, and the company ‚ÄúHorns and hoofs‚Äù got the whole business up.  We were in a very unpleasant situation.  But we are obliged to act according to the law and send everyone to the court, the police. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  LLC ‚ÄúHorns and Hoofs‚Äù turned out to be just masters of social engineering and design letters.  Because from them, over the past 24 hours, we were approached by 5 people and were eaten several hours by the time of the general director, technical, and support engineers.  Really hell.  They want to come with all this circus.

      We have already had similar situations, but on a smaller scale.  Once even the father and son found out the relationship.  One called to turn on the server, the other to turn off. <br><br>  In order to avoid such situations, I will allow myself to make recommendations of a quite obvious sense. <br><br>  1. It is necessary to draw up a contract for hosting services (server hosting and rental) for the business owner.  It's all as with domains.  There is a rich practice across domains, but for some reason, not so serious about hosting. <br>  2. If there are several owners, it is necessary to draw up a contract only for the organization that you own.  In no case, not one of the owners. <br>  3. Spend time in advance and think about how you will divide the business and diverge.  The data center provides hosted servers only to the one who brought them to the location.  Even if you have your purchase documents, we will send you to court. <br>  4. Payment for server hosting services should also be made on behalf of the person for whom the contract is concluded.  Or the purpose of the payment must indicate that LLC Podstavnoe pays for LLC Horns and hoofs. <br>  5. Take care of all documents.  Yes, they need to be stored, not thrown away or lost. <br>  6. Timely issue power of attorney and think about what rights you trust. <br>  7. Do not bring us filkin letters and fake documents.  We already have a hand crammed into a variety of cases.  The article will be criminal, even if by all concepts you are right. <br><br>  An interview with Kseniya Sobchak‚Äôs Chichvarkin is also recommended, where he tells how his guard stole all the cars.  Well, the case of Berezovsky against Abramovich in London, where Berezovsky argued that Abramovich was the nominal owner. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284910/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284910/</a></p>
