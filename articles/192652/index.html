While the population of the planet every day is closely watching the news about who has done poorly and to whom, and to whom it has become even worse, wonderful projects of popular science topics in the past are dying off, are disappearing projects that seemed to seem incredible. complex things in the simplest and most accessible language.  Projects that the latest advances in science and technology do not feel so confidently either: no, not new interstellar passenger liners, but something that is useful and is already useful to people in everyday life and everyday life.  We decided that more should not be so, and this is what came out of it ... Or rather, it starts to turn out ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a49/c63/1ef/a49c631efd5a0e87ab436213dbbc33a2.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  On the day of the next end of the world, December 21, 2012 (we felt that the date is very symbolic for the start of a similar project, we would have to survive just after Armageddon just with the help of ingenuity and simple but effective inventions) we launched a <a href="https://vk.com/brainworks">public</a> in one of the popular social networks, which is not customary to mention often.  Public has narrated (and still is) about what improves a person’s life with the help of human thought and technical progress already here and now.  Since ideas and inventions were already very controversial, and at times, simply insane, it was decided to call the project “A World <s>Without</s> Smart Ideas”. <br><br>  Gradually, the number of sections grew, as the inventions of the present and the ideas of the distant past and not less distant future, as well as various creative works and the results of non-standard thinking, were added to the tape.  The sections “Do it yourself”, “What if…” and “Experiments” got even closer to the participants and there the subscribers could see what was done by the hands of other subscribers and other neighbors on the planet.  Public we built, built, and finally, built - hurray!  (with) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a96/5ee/e80/a965eee8051b85c75653d2e62009cf76.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  And so, on September 1, 2013, it was decided that it was time to move from the social network to the network (until then, the material on the site was simply archived so as not to disappear).  The approach is not quite standard, usually everything happens the other way around, but it was done that way.  This is how the Internet project <a href="http://brainswork.ru/">“World <s>without</s> smart ideas” appeared</a> .

      The project presents everything described above, but the site provides more opportunities for the development and involvement of active participants who are ready to share their ideas, thoughts, as well as real incarnations of thoughts into ready-made inventions. <br>  And perhaps, what you thought of yesterday in the section “if it were, then there would be no problems” already exists and other project participants will be able to tell you where this something can be found. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/f71/b14/313/f71b14313ec944f38883d60e25da9c4f.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  For example, do you want to live in an <a href="http://brainswork.ru/projects/2013/06/17/derevyannyy-neboskreb.html">“eco-scraper”</a> or use a <a href="http://brainswork.ru/projects/2013/03/03/levitiruyuschaya-kompyuternaya-mysh.html">levitating computer mouse</a> ?  What for?  We, as the authors of the project, cannot give a clear answer to this question, but the inventors, representing such concepts, are clearly confident that this will make the life of the average inhabitant of the planet much more comfortable.  Perhaps you also have your own opinion on this. <br><br>  The project is waiting for nourishment from the minds and ideas of habrovchan in free presentation, it can be just a thought that came to mind this night, and long-established ideas that can be published in the blogs <a href="http://brainswork.ru/blog/ifitwill/">"What if ..."</a> and <a href="http://brainswork.ru/blog/makeit/">"Do it yourself</a> . <a href="http://brainswork.ru/blog/makeit/">"</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/5a4/85e/804/5a485e804ef85b75978dc01bb655ae00.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  And if you already have real experiments behind your back, like <a href="http://brainswork.ru/experiments/2013/04/08/prostoy-elektromotor-svoimi-rukami.html">“</a> Do-it-yourself <a href="http://brainswork.ru/experiments/2013/04/08/prostoy-elektromotor-svoimi-rukami.html">Electric Motor”</a> or something more complicated, or even a series of experiments - you can share their results in the corresponding blog <a href="http://brainswork.ru/blog/experiments/">“Experiments”</a> . <br><br>  What are we counting for and striving for?  We hope that the “World of smart crazy ideas” will not be left without your attention and developmental assistance, because it’s on the ideas of our participants that we plan to place special emphasis in order to get away from the not very good stereotype that “everything is invented before us and to not with us. "  :) <br><br>  <i>Write your own articles?</i>  <i>Easily translate articles in the languages ​​of the “most anticipated adversary”?</i>  <i>We will be very grateful to the assistance!</i>  <i>Take part in the discussions of the project, and just go and read about the incredible and quite likely ideas and inventions every day!</i> <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> Suddenly, there was an opportunity to arrange a contest where the real achievement of human thought - the “Tula Samovar” (high-tech, electric!) Will be the prize.  Contest terms are <b><a href="http://brainswork.ru/smartideas/2013/09/04/mir-umnyh-bezumnyh-idey-obyavlyaet-konkurs.html">here</a></b> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192652/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192652/</a></p>
