The contractor receives the order, assesses the terms of his work and sits down at the last possible moment.  Someone this moment is at the beginning of the calendar plan, someone - the night before the delivery of the project, it all depends on the degree of self-organization and responsibility. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why did I say that it‚Äôs about beginners?  The fact is that they are often not fully aware that the design and design phase is by default designed for a large number of edits.  After all, it is at these stages that the performer turns some abstract vision into real pictures and mockups.  And the client, having seen these pictures, begins to understand how he would like to change them in order to achieve his goals.  By the way, the same understanding comes to the performer, because a rare person is able to hold dozens of drawn detailed layouts in front of the inner eye. <br><br>  Thus, these designers and designers already in the first versions of their work try to give maximum attention to details and trifles, while scoring on the organization of the project as a whole, without thinking about that it can be easily edited in the future.

      If we are talking about a prototype, then closer to the deadline for work, designers begin to hammer on the master and styles, adding to the page more and more elements made in a hurry, just to stand beautifully and show the essence. <br><br>  Designers often hammer on folders, layers, invent incomprehensible names of elements.  The picture in the end turns out to be quite good, but then you will be tortured to edit it.  Everybody ever had to redraw any new element again, breaking into layers. <br><br>  And it seems to be great in the end.  In the prototypes everything is clicked, in the layouts everything is beautiful, but suddenly comes a pack of fifty comments from the client.  And our pseudo-performers understand that in order to make these edits, we will have to do a lot of work on eliminating chaos in the first versions. <br><br>  This is where the negative begins to accumulate towards the client, who will not back down with his endless comments, some of which are also completely inadequate.  And the less the performer wants to make these comments, the more inadequate they seem to him a priori.  As a result, several days to make fifteen-minute edits, no desire to enter into discussions with the client, loss of interest in your own project, just to get it off as soon as possible. <br><br>  I can give some tips: <br><br><ul><li>  Learn to create such layouts that were originally intended to make a large number of edits; </li><li>  Quickly make changes to the content areas of your projects, because these changes will not affect the whole project, but the speed of work will please the client; </li><li>  Edit the navigation and end-to-end modules only after collecting all the necessary additional input and discussions with the client; </li><li>  Learn to show customers changes from version to version of the project.  The initial version should always be at hand on a par with all subsequent ones; </li></ul><br><br>  In this case, you will cease to negatively treat the edits and comments, you will even begin to like it.  It will not take you much time, but in the eyes of the client you will do a huge amount of work that makes him happy.  After that, customers, in the future, faced with new designers and designers, who make edits for weeks and, as a result, produce not a very good result, will definitely return to you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203030/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203030/</a></p>
