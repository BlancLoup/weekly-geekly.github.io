Yielding to the current trend - went to IT, got a job in a company engaged in cloud technologies.  And since the direction for me is completely new - he made an emphasis on RTFM and began intensively to study the mat.  In the process - I wanted to clarify the place of the company under the sun of the local market.  While I was doing this, I had some accumulated material, which I tried to systematize and lump together.  It turned out, like, a good thing.  Well, and since mom taught to share, then here's a treat for you, use whoever wants.  (Summary plate - at the end of the text). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>1.</strong> Microsoft Azure: 200, 77 ‚Ç¨ / month client will pay for 4 cores, 7 (seven) Gb of RAM, 120 Gb of disk for standard configuration.  The site stated that high-speed and resource-intensive configurations are based on Intel Xeon E5 processors.  For high-performance clusters, cores are offered - pure emerald Intel Xeon E5-2673 v3 (Haswell) processors with a frequency of 2.4 GHz, 12 cores and 30 Mb of the third-level cache. <br><br>  For comparison: we have the base XEON E5-2650v3 2,3, 10 cores and 25 cache. <br>  A request for 4 cores, 7 (seven), 120 disk drives will cost us 99 ‚Ç¨ / month (SDD).  That, with relatively the same capacity (after all, the E5-2673 they have in a much more expensive configuration) saves ‚Ç¨ 101.77.

      <strong>2.</strong> Amazon Web Services.  From the start they offer annual free trial of the cloud.  Almost all the buttons are tied to create a free account.  The main anti- ‚Äúbun‚Äù is a user calculating calculator.  Attempting to calculate the cost of using the cloud, on sensations, was similar to an attempt to establish a close and gentle acquaintance with a slide rule.  I am even afraid to imagine what their management interface is for the cloud itself.  In general, having suffered an hour - I went to such numbers: <br><br>  1 instant from 1 IP to 4 cores and 16 Gb (RAM?) Will cost 159.72 ‚Ç¨ / month.  Price is excluding date of transfer, storage and other ELB. <br>  In short - it seems that they want to fool the head, lure, and then outrage)) <br><br>  Some numbers from us: 4 cores + 16 = 96 ‚Ç¨ / month + a constant opportunity to ask for help from a consultant.  Greater plus in comparison with. <br><br>  <strong>3.</strong> IBM.  Fast support in German / English, there is a website in Ukrainian, everything is simple and beautiful.  True, there is a slight cognitive dissonance when you see the service ‚ÄúSp—ñlkuvannya with experts on the pitch to the cognitive business‚Äù.  There are a lot of cognitive business there, which is strange. <br><br>  At prices: 4 cores for 8 with 100 places out 136.45 ‚Ç¨ / month. <br><br>  For comparison: here it will cost 98 ‚Ç¨, which, out of the blue, gives a savings of 1073 UAH / month.  () <br><br>  <strong>4.</strong> Krok.  Russian company.  One of the few who really has a proven Tier III Gold, and yes even Operation Sustainability. <br><br>  The cost of 4vCPU, 8Gb RAM, 120Gb SATA is 9,487.20 rubles / month, which is 137.1 ‚Ç¨ / month.  Everything is good, but we still have 90 ‚Ç¨ / month, which is 34.35% of the difference. <br><br>  <strong>5.</strong> De Novo.  The level of reliability Tier TIA 942 (!). <br>  Calculator 4 cores 16 Gb RAM and 100 Gb SATA they will cost ~ 129.53 ‚Ç¨ / month. <br>  As will be seen further, compared with our 98 ‚Ç¨ / month (for SSD), this gap is quite small, only 24.35%. <br><br>  <strong>6.</strong> HostPro.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãprocessor time instead of cores and recommend taking servers instead of clouds. <br>  The cost of 4 cores 8 Gb RAM and 100 Gb SSD they have 172.75 ‚Ç¨ / month. <br>  With our 98 ‚Ç¨ / month.  at the same power, the difference is ~ 43.27%. <br><br>  <strong>7.</strong> Tucha.ua.  If you believe what is written on the site - DC in Frankfurt, Tier III, etc. <br>  Price op.  at a cost of ‚Ç¨ 2, against our ‚Ç¨ 1.54. <br><br>  <strong>8.</strong> Ucloud.ua, promote Microsoft 365, specialize in 1C. <br>  They have 2 cores, 8, 150 will cost 4500 UAH / month, i.e.  161.2 ‚Ç¨.  It will cost us 51 ‚Ç¨.  This is a 111 ‚Ç¨ difference.  Yes, they give 40 for the database, daily backup and storage of 14 copies of it, but such a huge difference (78.34%) still confuses me. <br><br>  <strong>9.</strong> VoliaCLOUD.  ‚ÄúGetting into the corporate server at the data center, the yak was designed by the TIA-942 standard in the Tier III class of the interconnection of the server‚Äù It‚Äôs strange for the national operator to see such a standard, but at least it‚Äôs said. <br><br>  They sell gigahertz virtual cores, not the cores themselves.  10 (~ 4 cores), 16 and 100 will cost 4440 UAH.  For comparison: We have the same cost in 2744 UAH / month.  That is 38.2% more economical. <br><br>  <strong>10.</strong> Cosmonova.  There is a difference in location in Ukraine (say 1 core = 3.3 Ghz) and Europe (1 core = 2.8 Ghz).  I suspect, then indicated turbo mode, radishes)) <br>  For SSD-shnuyu configuration in 4 cores, 8 Gb of RAM and 120 places requested 200 (two hundred) ‚Ç¨ / month. <br>  With our ‚Ç¨ 100 / month, and processors with 3.0 GHz in turbo mode, this is exactly 50% difference. <br><br>  <strong>11.</strong> Lattlelecom.  Less than a month ago, we began cooperation with Ukrtelecom.  He started selling their cloud. <br>  If you take them directly, then 4 CPU / 16 RAM / 100 SSD will cost 130.76 euros, which, compared with our 108.40 ‚Ç¨, is still more expensive, and this does not take into account the payment for the same virtual router that we have It is generally free (I checked). <br><br>  <strong>12.</strong> Rackray.  The exact opposite of Ucoud.  If they are surprised by the high cost, then these are incomprehensible cheap.  Even writing them further, he received the answer that: ‚Äúa virtual server in the cloud costs 43.60 Euros per month.  The server connects to the channel 10 Mbps (port 100 Mbps) without traffic.  The price was quoted for 4 cores of 8 Gb RAM and 120 Gb on SAS drives. The cloud is built on the latest generation HP G9 and E5-2630 v4 processors (2.2 GHz, 10 Core). ‚Äù <br><br>  I will risk an incorrect comparison, but we have the same characteristics on the SSD will be 100 ‚Ç¨ / month.  How can I explain the 5-fold (!) Difference with Microsoft - I do not know, but I can not refute either. <br><br>  <strong>13.</strong> Gigacloud.  The main site is not yet available.  Their DC operates under the same standard Tier TIA 942. <br><br>  Slightly boring 4 CPU / 8 RAM / 120 HDD will cost 2300 UAH, and the virtual router, IP address, Internet 100/10 - another 275 UAH.  They offer it all with VAT, because the total amount will be 3090 UAH, or 109.22 ‚Ç¨ / month.  Referring to the cost of the same resources from us - we get 90.40 ‚Ç¨ / month. <br><br>  In short: <br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>  No </td><td>  Title </td><td>  Their price (euro / month) </td><td>  EUR difference </td><td>  Difference in % </td></tr><tr><td>  one </td><td>  Microsoft Azure </td><td>  200, 77 </td><td>  101.77 </td><td>  50,69 </td></tr><tr><td>  2 </td><td>  Amazon Web Services </td><td>  159.72 </td><td>  63.72 </td><td>  39.9 </td></tr><tr><td>  3 </td><td>  Ibm </td><td>  136.45 </td><td>  38.45 </td><td>  28.18 </td></tr><tr><td>  four </td><td>  Croc </td><td>  137.1 </td><td>  47.1 </td><td>  34.35 </td></tr><tr><td>  five </td><td>  De novo </td><td>  98 </td><td>  31.53 </td><td>  24.35 </td></tr><tr><td>  6 </td><td>  Hostpro </td><td>  172.75 </td><td>  74.75 </td><td>  43.27 </td></tr><tr><td>  7 </td><td>  Tucha.ua </td><td>  112 </td><td>  14 </td><td>  12.5 </td></tr><tr><td>  eight </td><td>  Ucloud.ua </td><td>  161.2 </td><td>  111.2 </td><td>  78.34 </td></tr><tr><td>  9 </td><td>  VoliaCLOUD </td><td>  158.57 </td><td>  60,57 </td><td>  38.2 </td></tr><tr><td>  ten </td><td>  Cosmonova </td><td>  200 </td><td>  100 </td><td>  50 </td></tr><tr><td>  eleven </td><td>  Lattelecom </td><td>  130.76 </td><td>  24.76 </td><td>  18.9 </td></tr><tr><td>  12 </td><td>  Rackray </td><td>  43.6 </td><td>  -56.4 </td><td>  -56.4 </td></tr><tr><td>  13 </td><td>  Gigacloud </td><td>  109.22 </td><td>  17.78 </td><td>  17.34 </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/314290/">https://habr.com/ru/post/314290/</a></p>
