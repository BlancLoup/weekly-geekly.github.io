Tips allow the user to quickly enter a query, refine it, and also enter it correctly.  For the digital environment, the question "Can a brand get into the tips of a search engine?".  Based on what factors are tips prompted for users?  Is it possible to get into the list of tips through services like <a href="http://vpodskazke.ru/">‚ÄúAt the tip‚Äù</a> and how does this happen in practice?  It is believed that the presence in the tips increases the loyalty of users, who, for the most part, think stereotypically: since I often see a brand in the tips, it means you can trust it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Finding a vital, branded, company-related query in tips is a dream of any brand.  This can guarantee an increase in traffic and is especially important for young sites that find it difficult to ‚Äúget through‚Äù to the top.  At the same time, getting into tips can be almost as difficult as getting to the top: search engines use a special algorithm to generate tips.  On the algorithm for the formation of tips and how young sites may still be there, we will tell you in this post. <br><br><h2>  Algorithm for forming tips </h2><br><ul><li>  The following steps of the algorithm are collected and screened by user search queries to form hints: </li><li>  Collection: incoming user requests at the beginning need to be collected. </li><li>  Filtering: Fix typos, weed out obscene language and rare requests.  At this stage, according to different sources, there are from 15 to 25 million requests </li><li>  Grouping: filtered requests are divided into groups based on the same occurrences of words, as seen in the introductory picture of the post, where, for example, all the clues, beginning with "why should I ...". </li></ul><br>  Here it should be noted that the prompts differ in the following parameters: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  geo targeting </li><li>  tongue </li></ul><br>  The search engine marks the most popular queries of the city, region or country where you are now - if you let the search engine "see" your location.  In this case, you can observe hints like: <br><br><blockquote>  hotels + in Moscow, shipping + Yaroslavl, etc. </blockquote><br>  Personal prompts based on previous searches - another option that is based on the history of user requests in case this option is also enabled. <br><br><h2>  Tips ranking </h2><br>  Tips ranking is based on the following two factors: <br><br><ul><li>  query popularity </li><li>  value of the request for the user (determined by personal data) </li><li>  request specifics (for example, obscene or "adult" prompts do not exist </li></ul><br>  Here combinations are possible, for example, a sharp increase in the popularity of a query in a very short time will affect the ranking of the hint - even if this popularity did not persist for a long time.  As a rule, these are tips on significant events, the memory of which is stored on the Internet.  In this case, when ranking tips, the search engine will also take into account the resonance of this event in social networks and forums. <br><br><h2>  When are hints deleted? </h2><br>  Search engines update the information in the tips and take action in order to keep it up to date.  Removed prompts in the following cases: <br><br><ul><li>  Loss of relevance tips </li><li>  Tips related to pornographic services (eliminated at the initial stage) </li><li>  Clues related to incitement to violence or racial hatred (eliminated at the initial stage) </li><li>  Personal Information Tips </li><li>  Court requirement </li><li>  Obvious cheat </li></ul><br><br><h2>  How to get to the tips? </h2><br>  The very interesting presentation of the head and founder of the ALTWeb Group Nikolay Khivrin at a recent online conference on digital marketing was devoted to the mechanisms of the hint algorithm; <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nz5yJUeXjo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhT9UpuFTiBF6bIRMqP5o2D1Xn5Aw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="http://www.megaindex.tv/programs/osennyaya_praktika_megaindex_tv_2014/zapis_doklada_%3B_nikolaya_hivrina_/">A source</a> <br><br>  Search engines struggle with the presence of brands in the tips, but sometimes the appearance of the brand in the tips is justified and even the search engine has to agree with this.  This happens in the following cases: <br><br>  <b>Active outdoor advertising</b> <br><br>  You can try to make advertising so as to encourage users to search the site.  A large number of requests can - but do not guarantee - a brand hit the tips. <br><br>  <b>Participation in events</b> <br><br>  The event should gather a large audience - this can provide the necessary volume of user requests.  A brand can act as a sponsor, organizer or speaker at an event.  The method may affect the appearance of the brand in the tips, but does not guarantee this. <br><br>  <b>Service "In the tip"</b> <br><br>  By adding a vital (i.e. branded) request to the <a href="http://vpodskazke.ru/">‚ÄúAt the Tip‚Äù service,</a> you give the task to numerous users selected by geographic location to start searching for your site for this request.  Thus, it is possible to provide both a sharp surge in inquiries related to the brand and to stimulate a long-term interest in a specific query, which can ensure getting into the prompts of search engines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a34/ac5/9b1/a34ac59b1c9d456f0f6051057d8925b5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>An example of brands getting into search tips.</i>  <a href="http://source.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml%3F2014/01/21/557183">A source</a> <br><br><blockquote>  The In-Prompt service allows you to add a low-frequency query to the high-frequency prompts.  The screenshot clearly shows the presence of the acclaimed company "Gruzichkoff", which was in the tips on one of the most competitive and high-frequency queries "Shipping".  This is almost a unique case in digital marketing, which you can ‚Äútouch‚Äù yourself right now, just start typing the ‚Äútrucking‚Äù query in Yandex. </blockquote><br>  From the above, we can conclude that the search hints are also one of the tools of digital marketing related to brand awareness and the presence of traffic on vital inquiries.  Thus, you are very lucky if you see the name of your company in the prompts: this means that users are looking for you, reacting to your advertising actions and increasing the trust in the company. <br><br>  <b>More on this topic:</b> <br>  <a href="http://vpodskazke.ru/">Service "In the tip"</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.megaindex.tv/programs/osennyaya_praktika_megaindex_tv_2014/zapis_doklada_%3B_nikolaya_hivrina_/">Search tips report by Nikolay Khivrin</a> <br>  <a href="http://anokalintik.ru/smeshnye-poiskovye-podskazki-v-yandeks-i-google.html">A selection of</a> unexpected combinations of tips </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/241770/">https://habr.com/ru/post/241770/</a></p>
