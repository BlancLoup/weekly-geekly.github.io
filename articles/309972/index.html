According to Maslow's well-known pyramid, the Internet, of course, does not satisfy the primary level of needs (with food and sleep, on the contrary, often problems), but it copes well with the following steps, primarily with communication and self-realization.  Chat rooms, forums, social networks - all this is familiar to everyone area of ‚Äã‚Äãcommunication with people.  But there is an invisible sphere, where programs, scripts and bots carry out their important mission and speak with the user. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/infobip/blog/309972/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5f/933/dd8/b5f933dd83dc4a549781ee50d2415ba4.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Why should websites, applications and other Internet projects communicate with the user?  Among the many reasons, the key ones are increasing the loyalty of the audience to the project, ease of use of the service, providing the visitor with relevant information. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Systematic, but unobtrusive communication of the project with the client creates a sense of security and security of the latter.  Information received in time is invisible to the consumer and, at the same time, irreplaceable.  You can compare with a comfortable chair, the softness of which you do not notice until you find yourself on a hard chair.  The lack of information or, on the contrary, its excess causes the whole range of negatives - from panic to irritation. <br><br>  Let's look at several scenarios of communication service with the user, which <a href="http://www.infobip.com/ru">Infobip</a> offers for partner Internet projects: <br><br><h3>  Two-factor authentication </h3><br>  It is also called two-stage.  Today it is the standard for most services, working with which, the user is required to leave personal data.  One password is not enough to protect the data, it can be stolen, calculated, intercepted.  Therefore, more and more services offer the user to confirm their identity through an additional channel of information.  Most often, SMS is used for this, but other channels can be configured, for example, a phone call or one of the instant messengers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31b/b0a/6b6/31bb0a6b6c694931b599944d1d400d16.png"><br><br>  The presence of two-factor authentication is an important marker for the user that his data is protected, as well as good insurance for an Internet project.  Usually two-factor authentication is used during registration.  Further, in case of suspicious actions, for example, authorization from an unusual place, or when you run critical processes within your account, always protected by an additional password, such as transferring funds, changing the contact e-mail, etc. <br><br><h3>  Subscribe to news </h3><br>  Newsletter is the most popular way to interact with a web project.  It can be push-messages, and distribution by means of instant messengers, and SMS or e-mail.  The main thing is that users agree to receive the newsletter. <br><br>  For example, customers of online stores and auctions receive timely information about the appearance of new products of interest, and sellers instantly know that they are interested in their goods. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/435/5e9/649/4355e96494c648e895fcc6e5e0f8a884.jpg"><br><br>  If we are talking about an information portal, then the visitor can offer notifications on some topics, for example, all the news about the Olympics or Elections. <br><br>  But it is important to remember that what the seller needs is not always the buyer, and vice versa.  It is important to send only really relevant information.  Do not overdo it with the number of messages, otherwise your user will disable push or block email. <br><br><h3>  Electronic calendar </h3><br>  There are types of services in which it is important not only to provide the service, but also to plan its receipt.  For example, services for finding jobs and employees.  Here an excellent solution would be to use an electronic calendar, which reminds of important events, affairs and meetings, and also ensures that the planned actions of the user do not overlap with each other in time.  The best option is to send a reminder to your mobile phone.  If an application is installed, then push notifications. <br><br>  The calendar will allow a person to not forget and not miss, and SMS or push - to have on hand important information, for example, about the place and time of the meeting. <br><br><h3>  Booking systems </h3><br>  Another important area in which an Internet project needs to quickly and at minimal cost contact a customer is travel and travel services, buying airline tickets and booking hotels.  For example, the owner of a plane ticket must know in time that his flight has been rescheduled.  In this case, sending by e-mail is not always convenient, and besides, many people have developed a habit of checking mail only at certain times on working days, and forget about it on holidays.  With the help of the service, you can configure reminders of the upcoming flight.  The same applies to booking accommodation, buying e-tickets to various events.  It is better to find out about any changes in armor in advance, rather than on arrival.  You can use Viber, SMS, push, email. <br><br>  In a similar way, messages for the sale of tickets to the cinema, theater, football and any other events use the message. <br><br><h3>  B2B Alert </h3><br>  Any B2B service has an office for managing projects or campaigns.  Online advertising, Internet monitoring or technical monitoring of the system, tracking its performance, and many other processes.  The peculiarity of such systems is that the processes in them around the clock, a critical event can happen at night or on weekends.  Critical change notifications to a mobile phone is a service requested by the client. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/949/f54/a97/949f54a97a18464cbed30b08782d6897.jpg"><br><br>  If we are talking about the advertising office, then it is important to warn the user about such events as the exhaustion of the budget, the suspension of ads, the fall in the CTR below a critical value and much more.  Users are interested in learning about such changes immediately, and not after a couple of days when they check the mail associated with the account. <br><br>  A message, for example, might look like this: <i>Campaign N100500: 3 banners accepted by a moderator.</i> <br><br><h3>  Work with databases </h3><br>  Any client service gradually accumulates a database of user phone numbers, but the larger the database of numbers, the more outdated information it contains.  Users change numbers, transfer them to another operator.  Distributing to invalid numbers is actually throwing money down the drain.  Therefore, periodically the base must be cleaned using the HLR service (number check service).  It will allow you to update the database, clear it from invalid numbers, check the ported numbers (transferred to another operator), etc. <br><br><h3>  Voice Services </h3><br>  If your audience is not only residents of a megapolis, at the age of 25-30 years old, and you work with small cities and with older people, then you can use the option of voice services.  For many people, SMS is not the most successful communication channel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d78/d6b/fca/d78d6bfcadd24ecb915c7ce6ffecec37.jpg"><br><br>  Someone does not allow to read the message age and vision, someone may be in the zone of a weak signal of the mobile operator.  In this case, you can give your users the opportunity to choose whether to receive messages via SMS to a mobile or by voice call to a landline phone.  For a voice call, the text2speech technology is used, when the text that the system generated is voiced by the robot to the subscriber during a call on a landline phone. <br><br>  All the features described above are among the most common needs.  However, this does not mean that if the project works in a unique niche, then for him these possibilities are useless.  In our practice there are a lot of interesting solutions. <br><br>  One of the last is sending out to the employees from the automatic monitoring system, which monitors the performance of the system and signals to the technicians if something went wrong. <br><br>  In order for this article to bring not only theoretical, but also practical benefits, we suggest that you briefly describe your project in the comments, and Infobip experts will tell you how communication with your users can be used. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309972/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309972/</a></p>
