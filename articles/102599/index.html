      <b>Conclusion:</b> apparently, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking software available in the 40 most widely used languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world played a role. <br><br>  In general, it is not bad if you do not pay attention to the fact that we were on the move adding new devices and struggling with bugs. <br><br>  Inspired by the spread of our first program, we completely forgot to show people another free application that we developed two months ago, even translated into Albanian and posted on the site, but did not reach to show it to consumers.  It's not even that we were too busy with the first project, it‚Äôs just not very obvious how and where to offer this application.  The fact is that this is the Women's Calendar - a calendar for predicting the menstrual cycle and everything connected with it. <br><br><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_RGs6qhDaMXc/THSsKTCTwpI/AAAAAAAALwY/x_R0T2-2sE4/ovulationcalendar.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In fact, the demand for this kind of software is, it is steady and, assuming how many women in the world are between the ages of 16 and 51, it covers most of the population of the planet. <br>  By the way, here <a href="http://www.un.org/">are the UN data</a> for a sample of the target group. <br><br>  <b>Number of women</b> <br><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_RGs6qhDaMXc/THSsKFR9DGI/AAAAAAAALwQ/Wo2csuyg5RE/female.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Data on the age group of the population of the planet</b> <br><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_RGs6qhDaMXc/THSsKKpd57I/AAAAAAAALwU/pdcqvEclngM/populationage.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Based on the <a href="http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp%3Fid%3D703807">data of Garnter</a> that there are now more than a billion PCs in the world, I would like to hope that not many less than half a billion of them serve women. <br><br>  In a global sense, the Women's Calendar helps the girl to move towards one of the alternative goals: to become pregnant or abstain from pregnancy.  The calendar reports the days when conception is most likely.  It seems that the girl, having seen the message ‚Äútoday is the most auspicious day for conceiving a girl,‚Äù will take time off from work in order to go to work tirelessly over the set goal, since the chances are high.  Or vice versa, seeing the inscription ‚ÄúToday it is possible!‚Äù Will go to work with unclarging hands, but pursuing another benefit. <br>  In general, besides jokes, gynecologists recommend that all women of the fair sex keep records of their cycle, until today nothing has been cleverer that has been thought up except for stupidly ‚Äúremembering‚Äù and only the most advanced ones mark something in the pocket calendar. <br>  In addition to 2 large tasks - the Women's calendar clearly represents the information when the last time was ‚Äúwas‚Äù and when about ‚Äúit would start again‚Äù.  Those who have not been a woman since childhood probably cannot understand how sometimes it is difficult to remember the last date of the ‚Äúdays‚Äù and figure out whether you have a delay today or not? <br>  In general, the calendar is a useful thing, there is a whole lot of information on counting sex, medicine, and even planning the sign of the zodiac and the sex of the future child (for those who care). <br>  After seeing what similar products offer, we came to the conclusion that they all have three major drawbacks: <br><ul><li>  not an impressive interface at all </li><li>  no more than 5 localization languages ‚Äã‚Äã- this means that, for example, Polish ladies who do not know English, most likely will not use the program </li><li>  all developers want 20 bucks for their creativity.  <a href="http://www.ovulation-calendar.com/register.html">Seriously</a> . </li></ul><br><br>  Actually, <a href="http://ovulation-calendar.hamstersoft.com/">we did the calendar</a> , but somehow it does not work out to show it to the girls because of the delicacy of the questions that it is intended to solve.  If people freely share the joy of using a video converter, an archiver or a BlueRay-burner, and the product‚Äôs popularity grows by itself, then I have little idea that one young lady can advise another to use this kind of software. <br>  Why do we write about this in Habr√©: <br><ul><li>  it is necessary to present at least at a private show of an exclusive audience a new product </li><li>  I want to know the opinions about whether we made a mistake in choosing a home utility or just distributing this program will take a little longer and go a completely different way than casual software for entertainment. </li></ul><br><br>  PS Can we on the site of everyone <a href="http://www.google.com/images%3Fum%3D1%26hl%3Dru%26newwindow%3D1%26biw%3D1920%26bih%3D953%26tbs%3Disch:1%26sa%3D1%26q%3Dhappy%2Bcouple%26aq%3Df%26aqi%3Dg1%26aql%3D%26oq%3D%26gs_rfai%3D">here such a</a> post? <br><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_RGs6qhDaMXc/THSsKZdjYdI/AAAAAAAALwc/YtMtc7vIUDY/happycouple.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Well, at least just as a demonstration of the helplessness of glossy marketing? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/102599/">https://habr.com/ru/post/102599/</a></p>
