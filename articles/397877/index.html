Inkjet printers with "pirated" cartridges produced by third-party companies simply refused to work.  Inkjet, which is characterized by this problem, began to display the following messages: ‚ÄúThese cartridges are missing and damaged.  Replace cartridges to restore printing. ‚Äù  As it turned out, the point is not at all that the ink has run out. <br><br>  The problem appeared after March 12, 2016, the corporation released an updated version of the firmware, which was engaged in blocking the old versions of the smart chip installed in cartridges such as HP 950/951 (950XL / 951XL).  In order to achieve the ubiquitous blocking of old cartridges, which are not completely legally refilled, the corporation has released a new version of the firmware, which, among other things, blocks third-party chips. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af5/2ef/001/af52ef0013274c0696359ccc08a55ec2.jpg">

      Users of printers of this company found out about the problem only when they compared their messages received from the company.  At the forum, where the problem was discussed, HP representatives appeared, who began advising users to reflash their printers.  Representatives of the company believe that their application allows you to save up to 50% on the cost of ink.  At the same time, the possibility of using non-original cartridges is blocked. <br><br>  Representatives of the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> ) have already managed to condemn this act of the company: ‚ÄúNow the functionality of the HP printers has decreased significantly.  It is simply impossible to use "pirated" cartridges now. "  And indeed, it turns out that users who expected to increase the efficiency of the printer, have at their disposal a device with low functionality. <br><br>  EFF representatives asked HP with the next scheduled software update to remove these issues.  This request was joined by many users of printers from HP.  But the corporation, unfortunately, did not immediately abandon restrictions.  Moreover, CEO Meg Whitman, HP, rejected the allegations of a deliberate ‚Äúfight against piracy‚Äù, saying: ‚Äú... updating the software platform is intended primarily to improve the quality of our system for customers.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe purpose of this update is to protect intellectual property and innovation.  These printers will be able to continue working with the re-filled cartridges from the Original HP security group.  Printers with other cartridges may not work.  In many cases, printers began to work much slower, ‚Äù- said in a formal statement EFF. <br><br>  Today it became known that HP still decided to meet users and lift the ban on working with third-party inks and cartridges.  ‚ÄúWe updated the authentication procedure for the cartridge to make sure that the user is satisfied with everything,‚Äù the company said. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e51/3a0/0cd/e513a00cdc296f6e8f1161ff602ba49a.png"></div><br>  <font color="grey">Black inkjet cartridge.</font>  <font color="grey">Cost - "only" $ 26.99</font> <br><br>  A spokeswoman for HP says the company has indeed banned the use of products and services that are not served by them.  Now management has decided to slightly relax the recently introduced rules.  So far, users have the opportunity to work with third-party cartridges.  But the company reserves the right to introduce blocking of third-party cartridges at any time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/42c/e09/978/42ce09978065c5eecaf8ae9045ae356f.jpg" align="left">  HP has already apologized for the delays and has promised to provide maximum comfort for its customers.  According to her, for those who agree with blocking the system of "pirated" cartridges for their printer, nothing will change - these users both worked with licensed ink and will use them.  The company will release a new firmware, which so far will remove the problem of the inability to use third-party cartridges. <br><br>  But this, apparently, is a temporary measure.  HP reserves the right to release in the future a common firmware for all, which will close the possibility of using third-party cartridges without the original HP chip.  If there is such a chip in the copy, then there will be no problem.  ‚ÄúCloned products with the original HP security chip will work,‚Äù said a company spokesman. <br><br>  Electronic Frontier Foundation CEO Cory Doctorow [Cory Doctorow] <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/what-hp-must-do-make-amends-its-self-destructing-printers">says</a> that HP‚Äôs actions are not customer-friendly: ‚ÄúNow most people using HP printers don‚Äôt understand why their printers don‚Äôt work.  The company will have to take a lot of steps in order to explain it to its users. ‚Äù  He also believes that buyers of HP printers should be free from artificial restrictions.  The problem with the firmware, he said, should be solved for all users at the same time, and not only for those who are more or less versed in technology and understand the reason why printers once refused to work with installed cartridges. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397877/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397877/</a></p>
