But there is nothing permanent and now the situation is gradually moving from a dead center.  With the advent of the MegaFon SP-A20i, I had the opportunity to compare my expectations from the Medfield platform with reality, in one of its hardware implementations.  What came out of it - under the cut. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/697/63c/99b/69763c99b0ed16b630278025324a3931.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This paragraph assumes a description of the kit, but, alas, I got the device in a completely naked form.  Nothing wrong.  But you can immediately write that the pre-release sample participates in the review, and not everything that will be told about this sample can be compared with those specimens that went to the shop windows with one hundred percent certainty.  I warned you. <br><br>  The case of the device is made of several parts, the assembly is made without gaps and cracks in the places of interface elements.  The back panel has a soft-touch coating, due to which the smartphone is quite comfortable in the hand.  The case material is the most ordinary plastic, not to say that it is of poor quality, but I have seen better.  The quality of painting is also not great, in the process of using the paint will peel off, and the process will start from the microUSB socket, due to the connector retainer.  When you press the back panel, the case creaks softly, an unpleasant surprise for an expensive device of 2012 release. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/14e/349/13d/14e34913d6a2167a23fdeab2a0139306.jpg">

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3bc/854/f5b/3bc854f5bfffc5536509f23776ef273d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/669/e03/4de/669e034deec0bac5d8a5ba2c65156a03.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a22/a3d/372/a22a3d37230996e2ba2b5be8c148117a.jpg"><br><br>  Run through the edges of the hull.  Below are two cutouts for the speakers, covered with a steel mesh.  The solution is quite convenient, the chance that the device will be heard in the depths of the bag rises slightly.  There is also a microUSB connector.  On the right side of the MegaFon SP-A20i is a volume rocker, a camera release button and a microSim holder.  By the way, the SIM card holder is the only metal part of the case that you can touch.  Above - a 3.5mm jack for connecting a headset and a second microphone hole.  And finally, on the right, the microHDMI connector.  The connectors are not supplied with any plugs, so the presence of dust inside did not cause me any surprise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/076/3bc/b6d/0763bcb6d4f16ac828da84c0962fa307.jpg"><br><br>  The back panel is completely monolithic, non-removable.  The only holes in it are cutouts for the camera and LED flash. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/697/63c/99b/69763c99b0ed16b630278025324a3931.jpg"><br><br>  For sweet left to inspect the front panel.  Along the bottom are four touch buttons.  On the upper edge of the eye of the front camera, earpiece, light sensor and proximity sensor.  In general, the standard set.  The panel is made of plastic, which can not be called scratch-resistant, after looking closely, I found several shallow grooves that arose during operation.  When tilting you can see the application of a touch coating. <br><br>  According to general impressions, the casing was made quite decently, the quality of painting the elements and the plastic as a whole can be recorded as flaws.  MegaFon SP-A20i comfortably in the hand, the body does not slip out of the palm.  The hardware buttons are arranged correctly, but due to the fact that they practically do not protrude from the surface of the case and have a rather tight course, it is inconvenient to use them.  You have to either press them with your fingernail, or make a tangible effort, so that they work. <br><br>  Let's run through the technical specifications from the Megaphone site: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Support for WCDMA 850/900/1900/2100, GSM / GPRS / EDGE 850/900/1800/1900 MHz networks <br>  ‚Ä¢ HSPA + 21.1 Mbit / s, HSUPA - 5.76 Mbit / s <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Android OS 2.3.7 *</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Intel Atom Z2460 processor with support for Intel Hyper-Threading technology, 1.6 GHz <br>  ‚Ä¢ Touch capacitive TFT display 4.03 ", 16.7 million colors, 600x1024 pix <br>  ‚Ä¢ Random Access Memory (RAM) - 1 GB <br>  ‚Ä¢ Internal memory (ROM) - 16 GB <br>  ‚Ä¢ Main camera - 8 Mpix with autofocus, the ability to shoot 10 frames per second, the front camera - CMOS 1,3 Mpix <br>  ‚Ä¢ FM radio with RDS <br>  ‚Ä¢ Wi-Fi 802.11b / g / n dual band <br>  ‚Ä¢ Supports Intel Wireless Display Technology (WiDi) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Bluetooth 2.1, EDR, A2DP <br>  ‚Ä¢ Micro USB connector, 3.5 mm headphone jack, microHDMI video output <br>  ‚Ä¢ Stereo speakers, two microphones, noise reduction system <br>  ‚Ä¢ NFC <br>  ‚Ä¢ Accelerometer, proximity sensor, light sensor, compass <br>  ‚Ä¢ GPS, A-GPS <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1460 mAh lithium-ion battery <br>  ‚Ä¢ Battery talk time - up to 14 hours, standby time - up to 336 hours <br>  ‚Ä¢ Overall dimensions - 123x63x11 mm, weight - 124 g. <br><br>  As you can see, quite a decent set of parameters is declared, with the exception of one minus - <b>Android OS version 2.3.7</b> . <br><br>  Turn on.  Intel and Megaphone logos meet with the splash screen.  As a basic interface, Yandex.Shell is used, which works very smartly on this smartphone.  Additionally, it makes no special sense to describe it; if you wish, you can always change it for yourself.  In this sample, the pre-installed <b>Android 4.0.4</b> system is pre-installed, which allows us to hope that the official firmware for retail devices will be available soon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b43/cdf/c2f/b43cdfc2f3b18e662c0b0e99c9af1ed5.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c71/be2/02b/c71be202b261413a361fe942caf6676c.png"><br><br>  The display of the smartphone has good contrast and viewing angles.  The text looks smooth, the individual pixels are almost indistinguishable.  Among the shortcomings - a small margin in brightness, in sunny weather, the screen will go blind.  Otherwise, there is nothing to complain about, the picture on the screen looks very good, although it does not reach the level of Amoled displays that are put on smartphones comparable in value to MegaFon SP-A20i. <br>  The sensor is very sensitive, driving Angry Birds on the screen of the MegaFon SP-A20 is a pleasure, despite its small size. <br>  The sound is also in perfect order, all the speakers have a good sound, the ringtones are played without wheezing, the audibility during a conversation is also at a good level.  In general, the volume of the speakers is enough for everyday tasks.  Vibrating a medium power, lying in a pocket of clothes, the smartphone is quite capable of attracting attention.  The quality of the photo and video of the main camera can be estimated from the materials below, nothing outstanding, but far from a failure.  The front camera works much worse, but it has other functions.  For Scype (and he works there), quite enough. <br><br>  Front-camera: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/811/046/566/81104656696c5a5d42e086c17c51e5aa.jpg"><br><br>  Primary: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/004/c10/7c3/004c107c34578d6ce72680798312751d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0b6/8d6/616/0b68d6616b41eb97a322619cee287c23.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/316/4a1/076/3164a1076629254bbf2d676d19d6f27f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a14/707/425/a1470742518f201a434e25e28ed591d8.jpg"><br><br>  Camera settings are quite adequate and are not overloaded with excess, there are functions of serial shooting and auto-panorama: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/539/7fc/6be/5397fc6be143475d92193289bd8ec555.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/99f/28c/220/99f28c220479613b0accc83732f4a0ce.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e1/ec7/12c/6e1ec712ce810c887b53ca9baaea061a.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/506/79b/7e9/50679b7e9c281280d874ee1b04484fb2.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c2f/d18/b20/c2fd18b203e71a12bf8e384efdff9aef.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/506/79b/7e9/50679b7e9c281280d874ee1b04484fb2.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a9/943/173/8a99431739797ac15d0858bd931e4927.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c70/bce/b76/c70bceb76bd0d96adde28229561da251.png"><br><br>  We understand with 3D.  I will cite below a short list of what started immediately and without problems.  To be honest, except that it was included in the list of toys were set AirAttackHD and OsmosHD, which did not work.  I didn‚Äôt put anything else, and it‚Äôs clear that with 3D applications there‚Äôs almost complete order. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Babel Rising 3D! <br>  ‚Ä¢ AngryBirds <br>  ‚Ä¢ SoccerKicks <br>  ‚Ä¢ World Of Goo <br>  ‚Ä¢ Dead Trigger <br>  ‚Ä¢ Death Rally <br>  ‚Ä¢ Gravity Project <br>  ‚Ä¢ Mutant Roadkill <br><br>  There are a number of nuances with video playback.  MX Player was installed without problems, the codec for ARM v.7 was installed automatically.  There is hardware acceleration, but it does not always work on all video formats.  So, the opportunity to watch with comfort and without clamping all the videos uploaded to the phone cannot be guaranteed for the time being. <br><br>  Navigation works without complaints, just like the vast majority of devices with A-GPS. <br><br>  By the battery life of the MegaFon SP-A20i I was pleasantly surprised.  With 3G turned on, it lasted for about four days in standby mode (stock status without third-party applications, data transfer mode is on).  In the mode of active use of the smartphone lasts a day and a half, depending on the intensity of the load.  Under load, the MegaFon SP-A20i's body heats up noticeably, but that doesn't scare anyone now.  Some models of smartphones that have passed through my hands, are heated much stronger. <br><br>  MegaFon SP-A20i has 16GB of memory built in, of which 10.7GB is available to the user.  There is also a 2GB internal memory section, all applications are placed by default there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b9e/f2d/896/b9ef2d896b2ac7d1face8cfe6821d781.png"><br><br>  Below are screenshots from several popular benchmarks, where MegaFon SP-A20i shows average results: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c8/3f9/0af/1c83f90afd2836f467eefda43cb75483.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/61e/bd4/f00/61ebd4f004f838a9e5e3bdab48c43b7d.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f21/d4b/206/f21d4b2062ee326ff5a79f9cc883dd27.png"><br><br>  In the final, it was decided to remove the back panel in order to take a look at the new platform with at least one eye.  The cover is removed with the help of nails and a plastic card without much effort. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/32d/604/5ef/32d6045efbc6a979aa55d7cca2452915.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a9/f31/a7f/8a9f31a7fd2f4762d8096b8ba5fd731a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eda/8e6/720/eda8e67207a89bd05a6f4cc6c7006359.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f93/b4c/ab0/f93b4cab087188c1e0c555462f7c7e27.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f6/9f4/d67/5f69f4d6758b0a3bef17fd5a5b677149.jpg"><br><br>  The internal battery takes up about forty percent of the internal volume.  The capacity on it is not indicated, so it remains to hope for the accuracy of the parameters declared by the manufacturer.  The NFC antenna is built into the cover and connected to the case using two spring-loaded contacts.  From the obvious "crutches" you can select a microSD card with a capacity of 2GB, which in combination is the internal memory of the phone.  I hope that a more elegant solution is applied to the serial samples. <br><br>  Oddly enough, the bottom line from exploring the MegaFon SP-A20i is mostly positive impressions.  During the use of the device, I have never hung up and rebooted, all the declared functions from those I have tested work properly.  By the time of autonomous work there are no complaints, everything is at a completely ordinary level.  Unfortunately, the MegaFon SP-A20i is not some kind of technological breakthrough, but it is fully capable of becoming one of the most worthy solutions for everyday tasks.  He is a strong workhorse, with no claim to top, but far from being an outsider in the world of mobile devices.  It remains to be expected that soon its value in retail will fall to a competitive level, at the moment the price tag is very high.  As for the Medfield platform itself, it‚Äôs too early to draw final conclusions here, the appetite comes with eating and I really want to look at its other implementations in the gland, perhaps soon we will have them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150436/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150436/</a></p>
