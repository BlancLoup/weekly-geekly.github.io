And when you take ASUS Slider in your hands, you are confused.  Plump, with rounded edges ... You hold it in your hands and you think, but didn‚Äôt the company make a mistake when launching a device that was inferior to Transformer‚Äôs design?  All doubts disappear when you click on one of the faces and open the hardware keyboard hidden under the display. <br>  To add a keyboard (and solve the problem of using tablets in everyday life) means changing the established ergonomics of the device.  One time, ASUS was able to do this by releasing the Transformer.  Let's see if she will be able to enter the same river twice, and why do we need ‚Äújust another tablet‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Specifications </h4><br>  Screen: 10.1 ‚Ä≥, IPS / 1280 √ó 800 <br>  Processor: 2-core, 1 GHz (NVIDIA Tegra 2 platform) <br>  RAM: 1GB <br>  Flash Memory: 16GB / 32GB <br>  Wireless communication: WLAN 802.11 b/g/n@2.4GHz, Bluetooth V2.1 + EDR <br>  Camera (photo): front (1.2 MP), rear (5 MP) <br>  Interfaces: 1 x USB 2.0 <br>  1 x Mini HDMI <br>  1 x Audio Jack (Headphone / Mic-In) <br>  1 x Card Reader: Micro SD <br>  Battery: 25Wh Li-Polymer Battery (for 8 hours) <br>  Dimensions: 273 x 180.3 x 17.3 mm <br>  Mass: 960 g.

    <h4>  Equipment </h4><br><img src="http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/8500/93298365.jpg"><br><br>  A tablet, a power adapter, a USB cable for connecting to a computer and charging, a black case in a simple black box are available for sale. <br>  Usually, cases allow you to work with the device at any time (as was the case with ASUS Eee Pad Slate), but for ASUS Slider the case is a reliable bag that hides access to the screen.  The tablet conveniently fits into the case, and its use implies the absence of haste when working with the device.  No, no operations on weight, you definitely need to get the tablet to work, put it on a flat surface and push the keyboard - after all, for the sake of it, you need this device, isn't it. <br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br><img src="http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/7223/58056283.jpg"><br><br>  Slider weighs 960 grams, and compared with the thin and thin (680 grams) Transformer is a lot.  But the Transformer with a docking station weighs about 1,300 grams, while the Slider is already equipped with a built-in keyboard. <br><br>  When folded, Slider can not be distinguished from other tablets.  At the same time, it is more convenient to hold it with two hands, but this is not particularly necessary - it is better to put the tablet on the table or on your own knees.  Sophisticated design and proper balancing with the center of gravity make it possible to use the slider even on an uneven surface. <br><br><img src="http://img526.imageshack.us/img526/2294/20599481.jpg"><br><br>  The tablet coating is a combination of matte plastic, resistant to fingerprints, and metal used in the screen and keyboard mounts.  Slider makes a specific impression in the opened form and almost does not resemble a tablet. <br><br><h4>  Communication </h4><br><img src="http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/33/57367148.jpg"><br><br>  The recess and the red arrow are the marks for the place where the slider should be opened.  On the back of the tablet are both the miniHDMI output and the port for the charger / connection to the computer. <br><br><img src="http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/273/42458285.jpg"><br><br>  The front line is nothing extra.  It is understandable, when the keyboard extends, it is inconvenient to use another. <br><br><img src="http://img265.imageshack.us/img265/8120/97235029.jpg"><br><br>  ASUS understands that users may need additional storage space for files.  On the left side, in addition to USB, there is a slot for a microSD card. <br><br>  On the same side there are several tablet control buttons: the power button, the sound level control button and the unusual Reset key, which is responsible, respectively, for the reboot (taking into account the fact that in new versions of Android have improved the work with hardware, the need for this key seems doubtful). <br><br><img src="http://img831.imageshack.us/img831/8262/54107759.jpg"><br><br>  Right side - headphone and USB. <br><br><h4>  Slider </h4><br>  An ordinary tablet turns into ... mmm ... an unusual netbook thanks to several simple actions: if you pull the slider near the webcam and put your finger in the indentation marked with a special icon, the screen will turn back and take a position with a 45 degree angle.  The first time to do it correctly and open the tablet without effort is not for everyone, but then you can do this operation as easily as on an old slider phone. <br><br><img src="http://img405.imageshack.us/img405/7351/65052065.jpg"><br><br>  The whole structure is very reliable and stable and can not accidentally "collapse". <br><br><img src="http://img841.imageshack.us/img841/1011/37302025.jpg"><br><br>  Chrome stand in the open keeps the display, and closed - folds between it and the keyboard. <br><br><img src="http://img703.imageshack.us/img703/4189/47444362.jpg"><br><br>  The angle of screen rotation, unfortunately, is not adjustable, which is slightly offset by the capabilities of the IPS-screen with large viewing angles. <br><br><img src="http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/6497/73189618.jpg"><br><br>  The tablet does not slip on the surface - the clutch is provided by four rubber feet. <br><br><h4>  Keyboard </h4><br><img src="http://img221.imageshack.us/img221/1126/67321820.jpg"><br><br>  The main dish of today's dinner party.  The ASUS Slider keyboard is a subtle engineering solution, on the one hand, providing dimensions acceptable for the tablet, and on the other hand, allowing the user to fully use this work tool.  The size of the keyboard is both its advantage and disadvantage.  It was possible to place all the necessary keys on it, but it had to be paid for with additional space: there is no palm rest, there is no touchpad with which you can control the cursor. <br><br>  The keyboard keys are rectangular and slightly small. <br>  However, new keys have also been added that are not found on conventional keyboards: ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome screen‚Äù, ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù.  These keys are designed specifically for greater integration with the Android operating system. <br><br>  The buttons are made of gray rough plastic, the key travel is soft.  The lack of extra space did not prevent the keyboard from giving a trendy ‚Äúisland‚Äù type, when there is free space between the keys to avoid accidental keystrokes. <br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br><img src="http://img402.imageshack.us/img402/7042/34084653.jpg"><br><br>  No difference from ASUS Transformer.  Two cameras, 5 MP on the rear panel and 1.3 MP on the front panel for video calls and chats.  With their tasks - participation in video conferences, a quick photo of anything-on-memory - cameras cope, and it is useless to demand more from them.  It is possible to shoot 720P video, but its quality will be inferior to video from modern smartphones. <br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br><img src="http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/9058/20058175.jpg"><br><br>  ASUS Slider has the same screen as ASUS Transformer and it makes no sense to talk about it well twice.  This IPS-display - one of the best on the market, shows well even on a bright sunny day.  Its only drawback, inherent in all tablets in the world, is a glossy screen that easily seizes fingerprints. <br><br>  A nice feature is the special protected glass that is resistant to damage even with sharp objects.  Gone are the days when the screen must have been stuck with a protective film. <br><br><h4>  Battery </h4><br>  The specifications for the device stated operating time at 8 o'clock.  This is almost the case, during normal operation (print work, Internet via Wi-Fi, music, video and some games) the tablet will live up to 7 hours.  Of course, reducing the brightness of the screen and more careful handling of energy-intensive applications will be able to bring the device up to 8 or more hours. <br><br><h4>  Software </h4><br>  It makes no sense to once again tell you about Android, while ASUS practically does not use its own "decorations" for the system.  Of the nice features, we note the presence of MyCloud, MyNet, Polaris Office.  In the previous review, we received a few questions about the work of MyCloud, so we will tell you more about it.  When installing Splashtop Remote Streamer on a computer, you can remotely control a computer through the application.  Also, MyCloud provides access to the cloud storage WebStorage, allowing you to backup or synchronize files. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  The main and only competitor on the Slider market is the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer.  Even if we recall that ASUS Slider is more an image device aimed at corporate users, Transformer still looks more attractive.  Indeed, with identical technical capabilities, ASUS Transfomer has a large number of interfaces, the longest battery life and a more convenient keyboard. <br><br>  However, the Eee Pad Slider has a full-sized USB 2.0, while the Eee Pad Transformer, in its tablet form, without a docking station, is deprived of this port.  The Eee Pad Slider is a true hybrid device, while the Transformer without a docking station is just another tablet (don't forget the importance of the visual effect).  Transformer becomes larger at times when you connect the keyboard. <br>  The mistake will be to use ASUS Slider as a tablet.  Ultranetbuk - that's his true face.  Only with an open keyboard all the richness of its capabilities is revealed.  He knows how to do everything that other tablets do, playing the role of a toy, and he can do more, becoming a really useful thing thanks to the keyboard. <br><br>  ASUS Eee Pad Slider is a replacement for a full-fledged ‚Äúoffice‚Äù laptop for people who appreciate mobility.  ASUS Slider does not replace ASUS Transformer, it does not try to compete with it, but searches for its niche in the field of ultraportability.  The next step to miniaturization is a slider phone, a long-past stage.  More weight, other engineering solutions - we will move to another niche.  Niche captured by the Transformer.  ASUS Slider is balancing on a thin line, but this place is his and it will not be occupied any more. <br><br>  <b>pros</b> <br>  Excellent performance <br>  There are all necessary ports <br>  Hardware keyboard <br>  Interesting design <br>  Screen <br><br>  <b>Minuses</b> <br>  Battery life <br>  Speakers behind <br>  3G missing <br>  No touchpad <br>  Weight <br><br>  Official price: 24,490 p. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132788/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132788/</a></p>
