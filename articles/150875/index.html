      We all work with computers and sometimes do not notice what we are sitting on. <br><br>  It turns out our sanitary rules and norms <nobr>(SanPiN 2.2.2 / 2.4.1340-03)</nobr> describe well enough a comfortable ergonomic chair for adults to work with a computer! <br><br>  <b>And which chair is correct?</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I did not think about it even once. <br>  Today, this said to think back. <br><br><h4>  About the chair </h4><br>  I personally have a chair ‚Äúfor visitors‚Äù at work, with the back on 4 legs strongly bent back, without any adjustments - these are put in reception rooms. <br><br>  It is lucky for those to whom the existing chair has approached, but I, reclining on my back and practically leaning back, cannot work for a long time.  And if you sit on such a chair in the correct position - your back is left without support. <br>  After a day of work, my back hurts.  I note that I take scheduled breaks every 2 hours for a physical exercise for 10 minutes - it does not help. <br><br><h5>  A bad and uncomfortable chair has its advantages. </h5><br>  You have to get up from it to take a break from its inconvenience - thus interrupting the process of mass accumulation.  But the uncomfortable chair has significant shortcomings: you have to invent uncomfortable poses, sit, crouching like a burnt match, which leads to scoliosis and osteochondrosis. <br><br>  Spine suffers!  But we subject him to these tortures 5 days a week for more than 4 hours a day! <br><br><h5>  Nice comfortable chair </h5><br>  It makes it possible to forget about the body and work with the mind really effectively.  Of course, there is a minus: inactivity develops, but this is easily solved by forcing yourself to do exercises and breaks.  After all, it is much more pleasant to periodically make physical efforts than to constantly deal with inconvenience. <br><br>  <b>I am tired of fighting with inconvenience!</b>  <b>Give a normal correct chair!</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/283/c89/050/283c890508f5af5cd8d63ae314e4328d.jpg"><br><br><h4>  What is this correct chair? </h4><br>  So, SanPiN 2.2.2 / 2.4.1340-03 "Hygienic requirements for personal electronic computers and work organization" gives us a description of the correct workplace, including the description in Fri.  9.6, 9.7, and in Fri.  10.4 required characteristics of a computer chair. <br><blockquote>  9.6.  The design of the working chair (chair) should ensure the maintenance of a rational working posture when working on a PC to change the posture in order to reduce the static tension of the muscles of the neck and shoulder area and back to prevent the development of fatigue.  The type of working chair (chair) should be chosen taking into account the height of the user, the nature and duration of work with the PC. <br><br>  <b>The working chair (chair) should be up-and-down, adjustable in height and angle of inclination of the seat and back, as well as the distance of the backrest from the front edge of the seat, while the adjustment of each parameter should be independent, easy to implement and have a reliable fixation.</b> <br><br>  9.7.  The surface of the seat, back and other elements of the chair (chair) should be half-soft, with non-slip, slightly electrifying and air-permeable coating that provides easy cleaning from contamination. <br><br>  10.4.  <b>The design of the working chair should provide:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  the width and depth of the seat surface is at least 400 mm; </li><li>  seat surface with a rounded front edge; </li><li>  adjustment of height of a surface of a seat within 400 - 550 mm and to tilt angles forward to 15th hail, and back to 5th hail .; </li><li>  the height of the backrest bearing surface is 300 + -20 mm, the width is not less than 380 mm and the radius of curvature of the horizontal plane is 400 mm; </li><li>  back angle in the vertical plane within + -30 degrees; </li><li>  adjustment of the distance of the backrest from the front edge of the seat in the range of 260-400 mm; </li><li>  stationary or removable armrests with a length of at least 250 mm and a width of 50 - 70 mm; </li><li>  the adjustment of the armrests in height above the seat is within 230 + -30 mm and the internal distance between the armrests within 350-500 mm. </li></ul><br></blockquote><br>  Image is clickable <br> <a href="" title="Adjusting the correct chair for working at the computer"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dac/582/784/dac582784710b5a5e6139cce59b47b76.jpg" alt="Adjusting the correct chair for working at the computer"></a> <br><br><h5>  Do I need armrests? </h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26c/ea7/7f4/26cea77f4ba56ed9c4ac815f92a40305.jpg" alt="Correct position" align="left"><br>  The armrests are designed to support a person when he gets up or sits down.  If the elbows rest on the armrests, then the shoulders can be in an unnatural raised position. <br>  The surface of the table can be used to support the forearm and reduce the effort to support the arms.  Armrests should not restrict the movement forward, resting on the table. <br><br>  If the design of the armrests interferes with work at the table, then it is better to refuse them. <br><br><h5>  Sit down comfortably, and your legs hang? </h5><br>  You may need a footrest. <br><br>  SanPiN recommends the use of footrests at workplaces: <br><blockquote>  10.5.  The workplace of the PC user should be equipped with a footrest having a width of at least 300 mm, a depth of at least 400 mm, height adjustment in the range of up to 150 mm and the angle of inclination of the support surface of the stand up to 20 ¬∞.  The surface of the stand should be grooved and have a 10 mm high rim along the front edge. <br></blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f8/a2d/603/7f8a2d60393bfb3fb88885aebbcb9f01.jpg" alt="Footrest" align="right"><br><h6>  How to understand that you need a footrest? </h6><br>  It depends on whether your table is at the right height after you have picked up comfortable chair settings.  If the table is too high and its height cannot be reduced, then you should increase the height of the chair and use a footrest to raise the floor level by the same difference. <br><br><h5>  What is offered abroad? </h5><br>  I found several types of ergonomic chairs from foreign manufacturers, looked at the websites of companies: Intershtul, Duorest (forked chairs), Herman Miller, New Style of <s>Light</s> (Ukraine).  Ergonomic models fulfill the requirements of SanPiN and offer a number of additional functions.  We and they have the same understanding of convenience. <br><br><h5>  Exceptions </h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36e/a7c/87e/36ea7c87e8e5ac77aa0fb87c101b370b.jpg" alt="Kneeling chair" align="right">  As an exception, chairs with supports on their knees should be noted - this is a separate type of chairs and they have different principles for redistributing the mass of the person sitting.  Of course, they do not fit into SanPiN, but I do not have reliable data comparing a traditional chair and a chair with an emphasis on the knees.  Chairs are not very popular, and in everyday life you could hardly see them, except in the Simpsons of Lisa.  In Russia, manufacturers of this type of chairs are not encouraging with attention, in Australia, for example, Kneelsit makes such chairs. <br><br><h5>  Where to find the right chair for working at the computer? </h5><br>  Regular chairs and office chairs in most manufactured by the production, unfortunately, do not have all the required characteristics.  Because you are unlikely to find such a chair in a regular furniture store.  Finding the right chair is the whole thing.  Basically, the required characteristics have premium class foreign-made chairs. <br>  Look for online furniture stores. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  I think a good chair is the basis of a pleasant comfortable work and the investment in it is worth it.  The invested money will definitely be returned to you, but not in the form of bills, but in the form of a lack of back pain and good health.  Proper good chair will last for years and keep you healthy. <br><br>  <i>Dear,% username%, I want to know if you have such a workplace, or maybe you use a chair with a support on your knees?</i>  <i>How has your work improved?</i> <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  Is there any sense in the headrest? <br><br>  <b>UPD 09.2018:</b> ‚ÄúTo get rid of back pain, you may have to sit differently‚Äù <a href="https://habr.com/post/421563/">came out</a> . <a href="https://habr.com/post/421563/">Habr.com/post/421563</a> - here you will find a completely different approach to the chair, maybe it will suit you.  I approached. <br><br>  PS For myself, a gift for this new year I have already chosen. <br><br>  <u>Corrections:</u> <br>  The name of the Ukrainian manufacturer of chairs was incorrectly indicated.  Correct <b>New Style</b> <s>Light</s> .
