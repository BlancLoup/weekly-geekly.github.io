This tradition is deeply rooted in the history of the E-LUG community, and no one remembers why it is so common.  But this is not the main thing.  The main thing is that we, finally, can loudly announce such a wonderful event and invite everyone to the business center Kontryent on 18th of September (Kuznechnaya St. 50b). <br><br>  I ask all interested under the cat.

Something has turned out, something has not yet been realized, but we will definitely do it next year.  By the way, for the first time we will keep a record of the reports and the event itself, and then post the video in open access.  Well, from the experience of past and before last conferences, we realized that the display stands are cool.  There will be two of them: "Multimedia in Linux" and "Games in Linux."  The stands, as expected, are progressing, new musical instruments are being added and iron is being improved, new game controllers are appearing.  Actually, this year there will be a MIDI keyboard and a guitar and a microphone, and a steering wheel with feedback will be added to the game.  During the break, you can go and see everything with your own eyes, touch it with your hands, and you can bring something of your own and connect it - complete freedom of action. <br>  There will be a small experiment this year.  One of our speakers is not a programmer and has nothing to do with IT.  Understand about who we are talking about can be easily from the announcement =) <br>  Another important difference is that we have moved away from the format of the event held at the university.  Now the venue - BC in the city center.  This has already saved us a lot of headaches and should solve the problem of accessibility to the venue.  In general, we decided that we need to make such a step forward. <br><br><h4>  Why do we do this? </h4><br>  We are often asked this question.  Exclusively for fun.  The event does not bring us money, on the contrary, every year we put our own in it.  In our club there are well-established specialists and entrepreneurs.  All of them sincerely support open source software and consider it their duty to support, develop and conduct their educational activities in this direction.  This is what some people call an "active life position."  We don‚Äôt call it that, we just do our favorite thing.  Of course, there are sponsors who support us in our endeavors that incur part of the costs. <br><br><h4>  Why visit </h4><br>  Such events are great for meeting people from IT parties.  Last time, a lot of people met and started joint projects, someone found a job, and someone started their own business.  This year, we are not only waiting for those who are looking for work or want to establish connections, we are waiting for ordinary users and people completely distant from IT.  As mentioned above, this year we will try to be even closer to the people. <br><br><h4>  Event program </h4><br><h5>  Part One: Community </h5><br>  <b>Nikita Lyalin</b> - "Club of open technologies in Yekaterinburg" <br>  <b>Valentina Shadurskaya</b> - ‚ÄúWebmin'im‚Äù <br>  <b>Kirill Lukonin</b> - ‚ÄúDecentralized self-organizing networks and anonymity‚Äù <br>  <b>Ekaterina Mikhailova</b> - ‚ÄúProgramming without an Android code‚Äù <br>  <b>Anton Derlyuk</b> - "SPO without beautiful" <br><br><h5>  Break and demostands </h5><br>  <b>Multimedia in Linux</b> .  The traditional stand, demonstrating the wide possibilities of open source software for creating music and creativity in general.  For everyone it will be possible to connect with their own musical instrument and try everything right on the spot.  However, for those who have no desire to carry with them, there will be a guitar, a MIDI keyboard, and a microphone on the stand. <br><br>  <b>Games in Linux</b> .  Igor is not!  Some will say.  It is not true!  This year we will once again show that there are games and there are a lot of them.  In order not to lag behind the multimedia booth on interactive possibilities, those who wish can play the races on the steering wheel with feedback and something else on the joystick.  It all depends on the preferences of our dear gamers. <br><br><h5>  Second part: guests of the festival </h5><br>  <b>Konstantin Beklemishev</b> - ‚ÄúDevelopment of multilingual multi-component applications‚Äù <br>  <b>Igor Tolkachev</b> - ‚ÄúLinux ahead of the rest‚Äù <br>  <b>Nikita Kardashin</b> - "The prospects of open source software in Russia in the context of sanctions" <br>  <b>Herman Deputy</b> - "Breaking Bitcoin" <br>  <b>Evgeny Palmov</b> - ‚ÄúRock programming‚Äù <br>  <b>Maxim Dubinin</b> - ‚ÄúNew Open Technologies in GIS‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Abstracts </h4><br>  <b>Nikita Lyalin</b> - "Club of open technologies in Yekaterinburg".  Every self-respecting city has an ACT community.  Or ... Every self-respecting ACT community identifies itself to some city.  In this case, the story will be about the community of the city of Yekaterinburg.  Easy educational program on how things are going, what tasks are being solved and why we are doing it.  For the seed itself. <br><br>  <b>Valentina Shadurskaya</b> - ‚ÄúWebmin'im‚Äù.  Own server?  Console?  Missing GUI?  For a novice Linux user, these phrases are able to put an end to the desire to raise something on their own.  Fortunately, in the world of open source software, most routine tasks are solved and all tools are freely available.  And you can master these tools in just a few minutes.  Especially when the professional speaks. <br><br>  <b>Kirill Lukonin</b> - "Decentralized self-organizing networks and anonymity."  It will be about various ways to go unnoticed in the network, about what solutions for this are available and what prospects are awaiting us in the near future.  Well, it would be foolish to miss the current topic of decentralized networks.  They are also called MESH networks.  What they are, is it possible to organize your home / house / yard network?  The topic is very interesting and relates exclusively to the practice of our day. <br><br>  <b>Ekaterina Mikhailova</b> - ‚ÄúProgramming without a code on Android‚Äù.  When you want to create your own application for a mobile phone or tablet, but there are no programming skills and computer science lessons are forgotten a long time ago.  A full-fledged graphical environment Scratch comes to the rescue, it looks quite funny, like a puzzle, only each element means some kind of action.  No code, no magic and complicated terms, everything is extremely simple and clear, and there are more than enough possibilities. <br><br>  <b>Anton Derlyuk</b> - "SPO without beautiful."  Often, when using consolidated software, one has to encounter undocumented features or errors.  Yes, there, some distributions already during installation may give surprises.  For example, format a disk with an already installed system.  Scared?  Everything is normal, there is nothing to worry about, you just need to follow the tips and always remember a couple of basic recommendations.  In general, as in any business, it is important to know how to cook.  And then everything becomes just elementary. <br><br>  <b>Konstantin Beklemishev</b> - "Development of multilingual multi-component applications."  Well, where are we without programming reports?  Right, nowhere.  Developing programs is necessary and important, especially in the context of open source software.  But this should be done correctly, with a modular architecture and an eye to international use.  The report of Konstantin is a real find for a perfectionist developer.  By the way, we are always glad at our event. <br><br>  <b>Igor Tolkachev</b> - ‚ÄúLinux is ahead of the rest.‚Äù  Where only will not bring the life of our brother ITshnika.  Sometimes it can even be a neighboring state.  But even there, in the CIS, as it turned out, Linux is quite alive and well.  Business and open source software, open source software and personal life.  Everything is so tightly intertwined and the reality gives the plot no worse than the Fellini film.  It was just an easy intrigue.  In general, it is necessary to just listen, it will not be boring, we promise. <br><br>  <b>Nikita Kardashin</b> - "The prospects of open source software in Russia in the context of sanctions."  Sanctions!  Sanctions!  Shout to us from all sides.  Someone prohibits something, somewhere impose additional taxes.  It seems that this is all tangled in a tight logical tangle.  We cannot but answer such a call.  Someone should tell not only about the negative aspects, but also about what new opportunities are opening up for us, and this is very important. <br><br>  <b>Herman Deputy</b> - "Breaking Bitcoin".  Recently, the topic of Bitcoin has repeatedly raged in the media and ordinary kitchen conversations.  Many things for the average user seem to be "magic", but something can go completely beyond understanding.  In fact, there is nothing difficult in technology and the only thing you need is the presence of someone who can explain everything in simple language. <br><br>  <b>Evgeny Palmov</b> - ‚ÄúRock programming‚Äù.  Scala on Scal and Scal chases.  Not for holivar's sake, but why not?  Especially when they talk with the soul and, as they say, first-hand.  This report is a severe Ural programmer about the harsh rock programming. <br><br>  <b>Maxim Dubinin</b> - ‚ÄúNew open technologies in GIS‚Äù.  GIS is developed by leaps and bounds.  New services, new maps, new technologies.  It would seem that the main contribution is made by mobile devices, and there are still clouds and open systems that can be edited by anyone.  All this abundance of various technologies, nuances and trends will easily melt the brain.  It is good that there is such a person as Maxim, who kindly agreed to interpret everything and sort it out on the shelves. <br><br>  PS If you have any wishes for the event, it is not too late to write about it in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/361717/">https://habr.com/ru/post/361717/</a></p>
