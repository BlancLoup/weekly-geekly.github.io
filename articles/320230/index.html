      Fujitsu offers various processor configuration options - the company's catalog includes 21 models.  Thus, you can choose the system in exact accordance with the budget: you can purchase a server based on E5-2603 v4 entry-level processors with 6 cores or on the basis of the most efficient E5-2699 v4 processors equipped with 22 cores. <br><br>  In addition to the basic version with 4-compartment LFF chassis, Fujitsu also offers a server with SFF chassis, in which you can install up to 8 compartments.  This model was tested.  If you remove the compact optical drive, you will get as many as 10 SFF bays.  But this configuration must be ordered separately, because  The 8-bay model does not support the option for further expansion. <br><br>  Specifications <br><br><ul><li>  Case: 1U, rackmount </li><li>  Processors: 2 Xeon E5-2630 v4, 2.2 GHz processor </li><li>  Memory: 32 GB DDR4 (max. 1.5 TB) </li><li>  Data storage system: 2 HGST SAS SFF drives, 300 GB, 15 thousand rpm (max. 10 drives) </li><li>  RAID: Fujitsu PRAID CP400i, 12 Gbps SAS </li><li>  Array support: RAID 0, 1, 1E, 10, 5, 50 </li><li>  Network: 4 Gigabit DynamicLOM Cards </li><li>  Expansion options: 4 PCI-e 3.0 slots (3 free) </li><li>  Power supply: 2 hot-swappable power supplies (450 W) </li><li>  Management: Fujitsu iRMC S4 </li><li>  Warranty: 3 years, on site, next business day </li></ul><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe0/31b/2d4/fe031b2d4e204bcdb108244b8a7c0160.jpg"></div><br><h3>  Server management software </h3><br>  For remote monitoring, Fujitsu installed an iRMC S4 controller and a dedicated gigabit port in the server.  The web console is not as thin in the settings as the HPE iLO4, but it is quite informative and contains a variety of information about the performance of key components and data on temperature and voltage. <br><br>  In addition to the remote power management units, the console displays electricity consumption tables for different periods of time: from one hour to five years.  Email alerts will notify the administrator if the sensors detect that the maximum set values ‚Äã‚Äãare exceeded.  In addition, when purchasing a license is available Advanced Pack for advanced functionality for remote control of the server and operating system. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a4/94c/1c8/0a494c1c83da44668dbc36b9d5c15703.png"></div><br>  <i>The iRMC S4 controller monitors the main server parameters</i> <br><br>  The iRMC hardware and software supports the eLCM (embedded Lifecycle Management) function, which is licensed separately.  This feature automates hardware and software updates and allows you to use the built-in micro-SD connector of the motherboard for local storage of OS images and their deployment, various OS updates, drivers and firmware for the server.  This license also allows you to centrally collect server ‚Äúlogs‚Äù and automate their sending to a service center, remotely test server components (RAM, CPU, HDD, etc.) with different load levels and according to the schedule, test and configure RAID arrays . <br><br>  Fujitsu's ServerView Suite provides a whole range of utilities for monitoring multiple servers from a single console, but it looks rather outdated.  However, an updated version of the iRMC management tools is expected in the coming months. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2a/3e8/7d3/c2a3e87d3114419c9649d6a45f3dff2e.png"></div><br>  <i>ServerView boot disk helps a lot when installing OS</i> <br><br><h3>  Different storage configuration options </h3><br>  For more modest requirements, the base system version offers two 4-port SATA connectors on the motherboard.  This configuration includes four LFF drives or eight SFF SATA drives, but the functionality built into the C216 chipset only supports mirror and stripe RAID arrays. <br><br>  For better performance and greater capabilities, you can use one of the Fujitsu PRAID PCI-Express expansion cards with SAS3 support (12 Gbit / s).  A CP400i card with RAID5 support and 50 arrays was installed in the system under test, an optional EP400i card has 1 GB of cache memory. <br><br>  The older version of the EP420i supports RAID6 and 2 GB of cache memory.  It is also possible to choose a configuration based on a flash memory backup recovery unit. <br>  The SAS SFF model with 4 compartments is easy to upgrade in the future.  Each group of 4 compartments has a backplane, so to increase the number of compartments, you just need to install a second backplane and connect to the RAID card. <br><br><h3>  Construction and power consumption </h3><br>  There are 24 DIMM sockets around the processors that are easy to access.  The maximum supported memory capacity is 1.5 TB, but with the latest 128 GB LR-DIMM modules installed, the total capacity can be increased to 3 TB. <br><br>  The cooling system is performed quite effectively.  The processors are cooled with large passive heat sinks.  The server is equipped with 8 dual hot swappable fans.  Entry-level models are equipped with 1 hot-swappable power supply (450 W) and Platinum efficiency level.  It is also possible to install 2 power supplies for redundancy and power supplies (800 W) with a level of efficiency of Platinum and Titanium. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a76/9db/631/a769db631b9f44668476bc168e3f1d14.jpg"></div><br>  The system has low power consumption - the tested model consumed only 96 W at idle and 212 W at maximum load (SiSoft Sandra).  Fujitsu did a good job of improving the energy efficiency of the RX2540 M1 - the power consumption of a system based on 2 Xeon E5-2695 v3 processors (14 cores, 2.3 GHz) was 107 W and 360 W, respectively. <br><br>  Fujitsu Cool-Safe technology optimizes the direction of air flow, and the Advanced Thermal Design (ADT) option allows you to work seamlessly at an ambient temperature of 40-45 ¬∞ C.  In addition, there are no hardware limitations on using the ATD function at 40 ¬∞ C, and systems that support the ability to operate at 45 ¬∞ C are not allowed to use the PRAID cards installed in the flash disaster recovery module. <br><br>  Fujitsu DynamicLOM network cards do not use a PCI-Express slot, because  They have their own connector on the motherboard.  The tested server was equipped with 4 gigabit cards.  Fujitsu offers versions with 2 gigabit cards and 2 10GbE RJ45 or SFP + cards. <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  <b>Pros:</b> highest performance with low energy consumption;  elaborate design for easy access to all components;  Xeon E5-2600 v4 processors, large memory capacity;  various storage configuration options. <br><br>  <b>Disadvantages:</b> outdated management software, but Fujitsu promises to correct this flaw in the coming months by releasing a new version of the software. <br><br>  <b>Verdict:</b> PRIMERGY RX2530 M2 server, despite its compact size, has an adequate supply of resources and is able to cope with various loads, including high-performance computer calculations, databases and virtualization projects.  ServerView management software, of course, needs to be updated, but the server itself is a good investment protection with various possibilities for expanding resources.  And high performance is confirmed by VMware tests. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320230/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320230/</a></p>
