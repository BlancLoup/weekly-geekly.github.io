  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Oh brave new world" or dreams of EDS-future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many people remember (and if they do not remember, they probably heard something) the wonderful Soviet film ‚ÄúGuest from the Future‚Äù.  Space pirates, time machine and clear-eyed Alice Selezneva.  Many, I think, then, having watched this film, they dreamed of being in the place of schoolchildren of ‚Äúone ordinary Moscow school‚Äù, whom Alice, in the end of the film (when evil pirates were disarmed and it was time to say goodbye), told about who and what will be in the future, as follows from the musical accompaniment of the film, though ‚Äúfar‚Äù, but ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù.  And now we all hope that the future will not be cruel to us, but on the contrary, it will please us and it will become easier to live - at least thanks to new technologies.  Details about the future and place of EDS in it - under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Unlike Alice, who knew what would happen to a group of Moscow pioneers who lived in the mid-80s, we cannot be sure what to expect, but really want to at least try to imagine what it will be like, this is the future.  For example - what unique devices and technical innovations - these unique ‚Äúmyelphones‚Äù of the computer era - will make our life more interesting, and most importantly, simpler. <br><br>  Due to the specifics of the industry in which our company operates, we would like to talk about the future in the first place from the point of view of developing services that make it easier for people to live in the ‚Äúpaper‚Äù field, that is, in the field of all those documents, references, reports and invoices that ordinary life is not encouraging, but "without them nowhere."  In our opinion, and here we will not be particularly original, the future is in electronic documents.  One of those technologies, the development of which will make life easier in the future, no doubt, are user authentication systems and crypto-protection of electronic documents.  Of course, today a lot has not been done, and much has been done not as conveniently as we would like, but the process of improvement continues.  Cryptographic products in Russia continue to evolve, and this is evidenced by the increasing interest on the part of those for whom they are intended (in particular, services that use the so-called electronic digital signature are gaining popularity), and the inexorably continuing process of informatization in government structures.  From what has been actively discussed lately - the transfer of public services into electronic form, the launch of the SIEV (that is, the exchange of documents) between the federal authorities and the process of issuing a ‚Äúdigital signature‚Äù to ordinary citizens. <br><br>  It is possible that in the near future we still wait for the fact that products and services implemented on their base for private users, involving authentication and encryption of documents, will be widely distributed.  Yes, now it can be difficult to imagine the use in everyday life of such things as e-signatures, the exchange of legally relevant documents in electronic form, and the like.  Moreover, to an ordinary person who is not particularly versed in all these subtleties, both these definitions and formulations seem to be somewhat similar to an explanation of the principle of the myelophone, but in fact everything is much simpler.  If at the household level we consider the possible prospects for the use of authentication solutions, then much becomes clear.

      Let us imagine, for example, one day from the life of an ordinary metropolis resident in the near future and where he can use new technologies from the specified areas: Waking up in the morning, our hero is going to work, and while coffee is being prepared, he‚Äôs from his mobile gadget ( it is not known yet what the mobile devices will look like in the future, but the fact that they will be high-tech and will have a large number of functions is beyond doubt) is booked via the Internet a place for a car in the parking lot next to work.  To do this, he sends a request and confirms his identity using his "electronic signature".  By the way, this signature itself in the future will not necessarily look like today (we all know that now the digital signature for ordinary users is essentially a ‚Äúflash drive‚Äù with an electronic key).  It is possible that in the future it will be enough for the user to simply leave his or her signature on the screen of the mobile device or leave a fingerprint on the screen of the gadget.  Already, for example, in some countries, an email address is considered the authentication method by which a user is identified.  From the point of view of simplifying solutions with cryptographic protection, solutions are now being presented in Russia that display signatures in a user-friendly way familiar to work with paper, so just such an option for the future is not all that far away. <br><br>  From the point of view of obtaining certificates, this, of course, does not bring relief, but from the point of view of use, the difference is obvious, since several years ago the situation was when the function of signing electronic documents existed only integrated with the ERP system.  When using such a system, often after signing at the bottom of the document page, a string of characters incomprehensible to a normal person was printed, or somewhere a tick and the like were put.  On these grounds, the person had to judge that the document was signed.  In the future, I want to believe in it, everything will be as simple and understandable as possible even to those who are very far from IT - even children and senior citizens have learned how to use smartphones and computers. <br><br>  But back to the future.  Coming out of the house and sat behind the wheel, our hero goes to work and, perhaps, the traffic police inspector will stop him (after all, cars will drive even faster in the future).  Paying a penalty for speeding is also not difficult, since it will be done electronically, and the signature on the protocol, as we have already agreed, can be put, for example, by putting a finger on the screen of a special device.  And it is possible that in the future, in connection with the development of electronic document circulation, inspectors of the road service will no longer need pockets on the form, since they will not need to carry protocols with them.  Of course, because of the delay in the journey, our hero will be late for work, but he will be able, on the way, having received official documents on his ‚Äútablet‚Äù, put a resolution on them and send the document ‚Äúto work‚Äù - our hero was lucky in this life and he not the last person in the company.  Well, the faster the documents are agreed and signed, the faster the work is going on, whether it is a state institution or a private firm. <br><br>  At work, our hero will exchange various documents that require seals and signatures (various invoices, contracts, etc.) with their partners, not sending them to the courier, but using e-mail (with documents signed with an ‚Äúelectronic signature‚Äù - no one will even have a desire to protest them).  True, students who are currently working as couriers will have to look for another source of income. <br><br>  Then his wife will call him and remind him that it‚Äôs time to extend the passport because they were going on vacation to go to Crete (or even far away).  Of course, our hero will not be dismissed from work in order to stand in line in the ‚Äúfront office‚Äù to extend the passport, but simply make an application via the Internet and ‚Äúsubscribing‚Äù, for example, with his mobile phone number (which is not a way of identification) or address e-mail, calmly continue to work, in the future receiving notifications about the processing of his application for mobile. <br><br>  It remains only to add that in the evening he will check the electronic diary of his son or daughter on the Web (or both, since we hope that the demographic situation will also improve in the future) and ‚Äúsign in the diary‚Äù again with an electronic signature.  And no two will not remain unnoticed !!! <br><br>  Such a picture we have drawn is already now in many ways close to the real-life solutions that allow us to create the services mentioned above.  Already now we see that the development of cryptographic protection solutions will go towards lowering the ‚Äúthreshold of entry‚Äù for the user and simplifying the solutions themselves.  I really want to believe that in its developments EOS brings the future closer.  Our company is on the way to facilitate the work with electronic signatures.  In addition, there is a development of the possibility of signing documents from any device (remote computers, mobile devices).  This functionality may be included with the KARMA system or presented as a separate product.  EDSIGN will develop in the direction of increasing usability and expanding functionality.  In addition, it is planned to provide work with various most common formats, such as xls, pdf. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131361/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131361/</a></p>
