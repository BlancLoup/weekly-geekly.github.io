  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Budget tablets in the New Year: demand is growing, smartphones are behind</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, MTS published interesting statistics regarding sales in its brand retail.  Namely: the most popular gifts during the New Year sales were tablet computers.  In the last two weeks of 2013 and the first week of 2014, the demand for such devices grew by 193% compared with the average for the year.  The tablets managed to overtake even smartphones: they grew "only" by 180%. <br><br>  According to the results of the New Year sales among the tablets, the most popular brands have become ... no, not all well-known brands, but so-called B-brands.  The fact is that, according to MTS, the interests of users shifted precisely towards low-cost tablets: over the year, the average price of ten popular tablet models at MTS retail dropped by almost half and amounted to 7,900 rubles (~ $ 230).  That is, people look primarily at the price tag, and then at the brand.  Last year, such a dominance of budget tablets on the market simply did not exist, so people took expensive devices.  Or even abandoned the idea to buy a ‚Äúpill‚Äù.  Now everything has changed, for which it is worth saying thanks to the domestic brands.  In the top five entered the model <a name="habracut"></a>  Explay, Digma and Prestigio.  All of them are 7-inch and, as you might guess, have the simplest characteristics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/12d/a42/105/12da421059d7c0d4ab636e3773fe05af.jpg"><br>  <i>Explay N1</i>

      From myself I can add that with the quality of tablets of local brands in recent years, everything is much better than it was a year ago.  I have in my personal use a certain device from the Russian brand, but with an IPS-screen, and with a design from ‚ÄúAipad‚Äù, but I‚Äôm just not using this monster of the beginning of 2013 model non-re-al-no.  The single-core Chinese processor allows you to drink tea, while Chrome‚Äôs new tab opens, and Chrome itself managed to be put out after an hour of dancing with a tambourine, since the tablet‚Äôs memory was full of tons of free (and uninstalled software) software, and the browser simply lacked .  But this product once cost 10 thousand rubles ... Of the five 7-inch tablets that MTS is talking about, I only saw live Explay N1 for 2,500 rubles (~ $ 74), so he doesn‚Äôt have these problems.  Yes, the device is not the fastest and not the most functional, but it already works quite stably and does not cause any rejection - rather the opposite. <br><br>  In general, the progress of the ‚Äúlocalists‚Äù is observed, and the progress is serious.  Now here is a wave of inexpensive tablets on the Intel Atom - the Explay has a model I1 with a metal case and a 7.85-inch screen (hi, iPad mini) for 8,000 (~ $ 235).  Not that Intel today was a leader in the field of platforms for mobile devices (I mean smartphones and tablets, not laptops), but personally I am pleased with this tendency - I was tired of cheap devices with Rocchips, Amlodzhiki and Alvinners ", Characterized by curved software and inability to correctly spend battery power. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad9/ea7/a2f/ad9ea7a2f21ee92e3f5d549847acc880.jpg"><br>  <i>Explay I1</i> <br><br>  It is very possible that I will take Explay 1I to the test - I wonder how the Z2580 will behave in the tablet.  In the smartphone, namely the Lenovo K900, it made a generally normal impression, but the ‚Äútablet‚Äù is a slightly different thing, it is not ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù with cellular networks, which means that it is possible that power consumption will be at a slightly lower level.  The developers promise 7-8 hours. <br><br>  Well, to dear readers, I, therefore, have two questions. <br>  <u>First:</u> what do you think about ‚Äúlocal‚Äù tablets?  Are you ready to buy or are you keeping off? <br>  <u>And second:</u> does Intel have any prospects in the market of smartphones and tablets?  Personally, I think the near future of Intel is just in collaboration with small companies: their products are selling better and better, which is beneficial for Intel, and this cooperation allows brands to get out of the "Chinese pit", that is, get rid of the charges of using cheap Chinese hardware. . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210972/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210972/</a></p>
