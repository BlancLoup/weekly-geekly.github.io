  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Two federal agents who run the Silk Road case are accused of stealing bitcoins</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Two former federal agents who worked on the Silk Road case must be detained on charges of fraud, money laundering and stealing federal property, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/nyregion/silk-road-case-federal-agents-charges.html">according to the</a> NY Times.  As it turned out, while working undercover in Silk Road, agents managed to steal Bitcoins from merchants' accounts (now these funds must be confiscated and belong to the state).  Moreover, for theft, they used complex schemes with dummy firms, forged documents on behalf of government agencies, with investments in dubious foreign Bitcoin startups, etc. <br><br>  Perhaps, the authorities specifically held this case until the end of the trial of Ulbricht, so as not to raise a wave.  By the way, one of the agents received a salary directly from the owner of Silk Road. <br><br>  The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/30/criminal_complaint_force.pdf">document</a> filed with the court on March 25, 2015, on 95 pages reveals a whole detective story with fascinating details.  Apparently, agents should be immediately detained and placed in custody.  But this is unlikely, since their whereabouts are unknown. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the case are Carl Mark Force Four (Carl Mark Force IV) from the Anti-Drug Administration and Shaun Bridges from the US Secret Service.

      The charges against the agents were put forward despite the work they did in the process of collecting evidence against Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the underground exchange Silk Road.  Togo was convicted in February on several counts.  True, he was acquitted of murder charges, and the Baltimore group, which included Force and Bridges, was in charge of this case.  So even if they cancel the evidence they collected, it will not change the sentence for Ulbricht. <br><br>  The Silk Road site was closed, and Ulbricht was detained in October 2013.  Bitcoins from the accounts of merchants and Ulbricht confiscated and subsequently sold at auction.  The preventive measure and term Ulbrichtu will announce on May 15. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMr. Force during the investigation of the Silk Road case stole and transferred a significant amount of bitcoins for his own needs,‚Äù said the documents filed with the San Francisco District Court.  ‚ÄúInstead of transferring them to the state, Force has deposited funds into personal accounts.‚Äù <br><br>  Tigran Gambaryan, a special agent of the United States Internal Revenue Service, filed a court document against the two unscrupulous feds. <br><br>  Force worked in the Anti-Drug Administration for 15 years, resigned in May 2014, and Bridges served in the Secret Service for 6 years, resigned on March 18, 2015, when he learned of the investigation being conducted against him. <br><br>  According to the investigation, during the work of Silk Road goods worth $ 213 million were sold. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366675/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366675/</a></p>
