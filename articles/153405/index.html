And if you really want to move, now is the time to strive for it.  Persistently and with all his might.

      To begin with, a good specialist needs to <s>find a suitable tractor</s> to become a good specialist, make a good impression of himself both on paper and in practice, and learn to present himself. <br><br>  If you exclude a university, then a good specialist will consist of: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8e4/81f/9e2/8e481f9e29e5d9eec1f4f504adc7f2f0.png"><br><br><br><h5>  <b>Certificates <font color="green">+ 3% success</font></b> </h5><br>  I have a stack of thick cardboard with patterns, seals and signatures, which is called certificates.  One of them (CIW) was even obtained on offline testing with recording to the camera, but these papers will only help to fill in the item on LinkedIn.  Otherwise, not very serious. <br><br><br><h5>  <b>Letters of recommendation <font color="green">+ 10% success</font></b> </h5><br>  Oddly enough, a person at one end of the world is ready to trust a paper signed by a person at the other end of the world.  Therefore, it is better not to be lazy to ask the manager to sign a recommendation on company letterhead.  A good recommendation describes the position, achievements in the project, the duration and quality of the relationship.  By the way, in order not to take the time of the manager, you can write the text yourself and send it for review. <br><br><br><h5>  <b>Knowledge of language and ability to speak <font color="green">+ 12% success</font></b> </h5><br>  Before my interview in Berlin, I found a couple of tutors and quickly improved my English.  And the mistakes in my letters were helped by my friends.  Now, a year later, I do a couple of units every day from English grammar in use and signed up for an additional module English for academic purposes.  And after strengthening theoretical knowledge, I will be more immersed in practical, until my English is perfect as a second language. <br><br>  Good English will prove to the employer the ability to think adequately and communicate effectively with potential colleagues. <br><br><br><h5>  <b>Publications and speeches <font color="green">+ 15% success</font></b> </h5><br>  You can work for 3 years at Google and remain one of 50,000 employees, or you can - 1 month in a startup and write a useful article or speak at a conference.  Perhaps you do not believe that your experience may be of interest to someone, but there are different audiences, including beginners. <br><br>  In addition to the obvious benefits of this experience, he will prove to the employer that you are interesting in your field.  After all, the project manager may not understand the whole steepness of the implementation of the Soundex algorithm in the Bash language, but he will definitely appreciate the 50 comments on the article. <br><br><br><h5>  <b>Experience and achievements <font color="green">+ 60% success</font></b> </h5><br>  The employer really wants to know how a candidate can help his company.  Therefore, it is necessary to show achievements in previous projects and, best of all, how they affected business and customers.  I am talking about any achievements: even in a company, even in a personal project.  If during the year you have not achieved anything, then this is an alarm signal and you need to do something in your free time or change jobs. <br><br>  By the way, about the change of work.  If you are striving for achievements, but your work is a complete routine for supporting the project, then obviously you need to change something.  Explain to the manager that you want to do something new, and new candidates will be happy to work on this work. <br><br>  Read many articles, invent and propose solutions that will create an achievement both for the company and for you.  Once it is achieved, it is necessary to highlight its value and sensibly describe in the summary.  I will give an example, a description of my achievements in the company Qiwi, in which I worked only about six months: <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Javascript Developer, Qiwi</b> <br>  Development software for instant payment terminal based on Web-technologies. <br><br>  <i>Details and achievements</i> : <br>  More than 100,000 payment terminals are placed across Asia and Africa.  Whether it is a mobile phone or for online purchases.  My main achievement was saving about 60% of time spent of 80% of users.  In the case of millions of customers. </blockquote><br><br><br><h4>  <b>What we get in the end</b> </h4><br>  As a result, an HR manager logs into LinkedIn, drives in the keywords that the development manager gave him and goes to your page.  He sees that the specialist: <br><ol><li>  <b>did a lot of good</b> for people in three companies </li><li>  <b>Oh</b> , even some <b>tricky articles published</b> , there are comments </li><li>  <b>english knows</b> ok let's talk </li></ol><br><br>  Then the development manager receives your resume and understands that you have something to discuss at the interview.  If you pass it, the company will do everything possible to get a work permit issued.  And the ministry will love your color <b>recommendations and certificates</b> . <br><br>  Successes in your achievements! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153405/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153405/</a></p>
