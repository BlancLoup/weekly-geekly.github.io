But we must find such people, they are.  They were not supported and their ‚Äúrotting mobs‚Äù, as they usually say, are jealous of the rich, they don't like the smart, and they simply kill the talented.  How do we do this to raise talented people from the people, to support them?  This is not an easy task, but we also have a weak government, right?  Let him take it, and we will move the whole world.  We need to catch new items in the world, we need to invite the best people to manage our companies, as we did with Air Astana, which is headed by a foreigner and, in my opinion, one of the best companies, ‚Äùsaid the Head of State, speaking on the results of a national teleconference.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  At the same time, the President noted that the task of Kazakhstan is to form a critical mass of innovators. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThey should be looked for, these innovators, to cook at home.  Without them, we will not carry out the tasks.  In my messages of recent years, I set the task of the government in search of 100 absolute innovations.  There is only one example: an innovator from Karaganda, Mr. Borisenko, and I have been engaged in his innovation for so many years.  Even I can not break through, but he would never break through.  The point is that he came up with such a technology, when the gases that go to our power plants are caught, they create completely pure carbon and there will be no emissions.  If this is a world sensation, can you imagine?  To clear all stations that are fueled by coal from smoke is an absolute innovation.  Where do we have such innovations?  We have such innovations.  Probably, we can immediately set the task (create. - Approx. Of the author) ten such innovations, so that Kazakhstan sounded all over the world, then ten more and come to the point that such innovations would come from us, ‚Äùsaid the President and noted that Kazakhstan did not need to hesitate to attract valuable shots from abroad. <br><br>  The head of state cited the example of Nazarbayev University, which is headed by the Japanese Shigeo Katsu, ‚ÄúEverything is going well there.  And do not be ashamed of it, so everyone did.  Singapore at one time implemented the program ‚ÄúGray Hair‚Äù - they invited the famous talents from Japan to work in retirement.  We do not need to be shy and do not be afraid of it.  Well, what can you do if you have not taught us this.  And we have no time to teach, we need to move now, "concluded Nursultan Nazarbayev. <br><br>  <b>Editor's Note</b> <br>  <a href="http://tengrinews.kz/kazakhstan_news/nazarbaev-prosit-pravitelstvo-nayti-kazahstanskogo-billa-geytsa-225744/">Original news here</a> <br><br>  For me, to hear this to be honest was wild.  Recalls the recent trend of Medvedev. <br>  At one time, many brains have flowed to the States, and now they say again, come back. <br>  For Kazakhstan, which by and large is rich only in oil and rich, it was a bit ridiculous to hear that. <br><br>  Everyone has a lot of ideas, but funding is hard to find. <br><br>  I really could not get impressive subsidies for my project <a href="http://forum.oszone.net/thread-205822.html">DriverX</a> which is used by 4 million users throughout the CIS. <br><br>  I would like to hear what they think about innovation HabrasHiteli))) <br>  Immediately I want to apologize for the copy paste.  I could not resist, so as not to discuss this news with Habr. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288920/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288920/</a></p>
