  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Losses of companies due to information leaks amounted to $ 36.9 billion for the year</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/588/f24/943/588f24943aea626d3d33e3234713d9aa.jpg"><br>  <i>Image: jetinfo.ru</i> <br><br>  Information security should be considered by companies as a matter of paramount importance.  According to Gemalto, in the first half of 2015 alone, the number of information leaks in various companies around the world increased by 10%, to 888 cases, RBC <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/09/09/2015/55efd5819a794775b6d8155e">reports</a> .  The main reason for this situation, experts say, is the outdated ways of protecting data in companies. <br><br>  Thus, due to information leakages, the companies lost a total of 245.5 million records, according to the Gemalto Breach Level Index report (the main focus of its work is information security).  The total damage incurred by the organization is $ 36.9 billion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the first half of 2014, the number of recorded leaks from companies around the world was 803. This year, this number increased by 10%.  82% of the data lost in a year accounts for only 10 of the most serious leaks in various companies.  The reason for this situation is an outdated data protection strategy that was effective several years ago, but not now.

      According to experts, companies must pay attention to controlling access to corporate information and user authentication.  The same applies to encrypting all sensitive data and storing encryption keys. <br><br>  Another research company, IDC, claims that the volume of the information security market now amounts to $ 32.6 billion. Of this amount, about $ 20.2 billion has been invested in leak protection systems. <br><br>  According to representatives of InfoWatch, the situation indicated in the report is more relevant to Western Europe and the United States.  In Russia, according to Natalia Lezina, InfoWatch representative, a similar situation is now observed. <br><br>  So, most often companies lose personal and billing information of customers.  9/10 of all information leakages are related to this data.  Most often, leaks occur in educational, medical and public institutions.  In Russia, various Internet services that store large volumes of personal users and are careless about the protection of this information are added to this list. <br><br>  According to Gemalto, the greatest losses for the reporting period were incurred by the medical insurance company Anthem Insurance.  Thus, as a result of hacking data, about 78.8 million customers of this company were affected by attackers. <br><br>  As for Russia, in the first half of this year, Gemalto specialists recorded only two data leaks here.  True, one of them entered the top 5 of the most serious.  It is about selling your personal data to 20 million users of the Russian dating service Topface. <br><br>  At the same time, the founder of Topface, Dmitry Filatov, claims that the data leak did not cause financial damage to the company, and that no data was included on the Internet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294354/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294354/</a></p>
