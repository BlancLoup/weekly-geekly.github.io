Continuing the <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/lenta/5343.html">theme</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Today we held a press conference with 1C, where we announced the creation of a 1C ‚Äì Bitrix joint venture. <br><br>  Our companies join forces to create new Internet solutions and achieve their strategic goals in the web development market. <br><br>  The 1C-Bitrix joint venture is created with an equal stake of the parties (50/50).  The company will be invested significant resources for intensive development.

      The 1C ‚Äì Bitrix company transfers exclusive rights in the territory of the former USSR countries to the Bitrix: Site Management software and new Bitrix products, including the product for the .NET platform. <br><br>  The software product is renamed to ‚Äú1C-Bitrix: Site Management‚Äù.  The release of the new version 6.0 of the product planned for March 2007 will be already produced under the new trademark.  The development and technical support of software products "1C-Bitrix" will be carried out by the company "Bitrix". <br><br>  1C Company provides the joint venture with the right to use its trademark to promote products and build a unified partner network. <br><br>  From the moment of the start of the joint venture 1C-Bitrix operation, sales from Bitrix are transferred to it, and existing agreements are re-registered with Bitrix partners.  Firms "1C" and "Bitrix" emphasize that the working conditions of existing partners, "Bitrix" in this regard will not change. <br><br>  1C and Bitrix will work together to actively develop a common product, promote it and build a partner network for its distribution, implementation and support. <br><br>  Sergey Vladimirovich Ryzhikov is appointed Director General of 1C ‚Äì Bitrix, who is also the Director of Bitrix LLC. <br><br>  Sergey Ryzhikov, Director of Bitrix: ‚ÄúThe market for business solutions is expanding rapidly, and the demand for Internet solutions from business is growing.  And the company "1C" today is the flagship in the market of corporate solutions.  We are pleased that Bitrix can complement the 1C solutions line with a full range of opportunities for organizing and managing an Internet business.  Creating a joint venture "1C-Bitrix" - this is the right, logical step for organizing the development, support and distribution of new products and services.  Special thanks to ValueTech Advisers, which provides financial advisory services on merger of companies, for timely assistance in the process of preparing the transaction. ‚Äù <br><br>  Boris Nuraliev, director of 1C, comments: ‚ÄúThe web development market is growing rapidly now.  The situation is partially reminiscent of what happened in the market of accounting systems in the early 90s or in the adjacent market of integrated automation of management several years ago.  The demand for technologies and services for the creation and management of sites is becoming widespread, which makes it efficient to create and distribute replicable platform solutions.  The Bitrix approach is to create a technological development environment and modifiable solutions based on it, which allows a large number of partners to organize an effective website development business and reach a significant share of potential market customers. <br><br>  It fits well with the consistently built ‚Äú1C‚Äù business model, based on a combination of an industrial approach to the development, distribution and maintenance of programs based on energy, qualifications and interest of the mass affiliate network.  Previously, this model has allowed us to achieve excellent results in such areas as 1C: Enterprise or 1C: Multimedia, and the 1C-Bitrix joint venture makes it possible to apply this approach in the field of the Internet. ‚Äù <br></blockquote><br>  In general, something happened that should have happened.  Many predicted the full sale of "Bitrix-Soft" company "1C", but this did not happen.  There was an equal union of interests under the new company.  ‚Äú1C‚Äù gives ‚Äúto use‚Äù its name and resources, and ‚ÄúBitrix-Soft‚Äù puts its knowledge and experience for the development of a joint product.  There is no doubt that the prefix "1C" to "Bitrix" will increase the trust of ordinary people, will have a very positive effect on the image of the product, and in general will open for many such a class of products like CMS.  Samopisny CMS and naive ideas to create your universal CMS hammered the penultimate nail into the coffin lid. <br><br>  It is obvious that mutual integration of products will be intensively developed.  In the near future, for those who have implemented 1C in their company, the creation or transfer of an existing site to Bitrix will be a more than logical decision.  This is especially true of online stores. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3780/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3780/</a></p>
