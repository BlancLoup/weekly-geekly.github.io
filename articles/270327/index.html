  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Call Tracking Paying Lead, Not Numbers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sipuni/blog/270327/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/653/f75/31a/653f7531a25b40b0a2825b0ba595f6bb.jpg" align="left"></a>  Many companies have a significant part of sales through the phone: customers call from the site, from advertisements, from offline channels.  Tracking where a visitor came from when ordering online has long been a problem.  But in the case of selling over the phone, we do not see what kind of advertising led him.  This task is solved by call tracking. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition to our PBX <a href="http://sipuni.com/ru_RU/">Sipuni</a> , which was described <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sipuni/blog/266921/">in the blog</a> , we decided to create our own dynamic call tracking.  In this case, approach the task in a new way: the price of the service should depend on the number of tracked calls.  The client should not think about the number of telephone numbers.  Numbers are allocated automatically as needed.  Thus, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcall-tracking with pay per lead, and not for numbers, was born. <br><br>  It took us about 5 months to do dynamic call tracking, which can be used for a large number of sites.  And there is still a lot of work ahead. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#2298D5">Where are the results of our call tracking?</font> </h2><br>  To display statistics on calls, we decided to use ready-made tools: Google Analytics and Yandex Metric.  The call is transmitted to them as an event on the basis of which the goal was created.  In the reports you can learn a lot about the visitors who called.  For example, how many times they came before calling, what devices they used, from what sources they came to the site.

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Thanks to the Measurement Protocol in Google Analytics, we also send offline calls.  Suppose a visitor has closed the browser and only then called.  In this case, the fact of the call will still be noted in Google Analytics.  But in Yandex Metric, this can not be done yet. <br><br>  But to completely abandon their own reports failed.  After all, it is necessary to show how many untracked calls, the list of phone numbers of visitors, the ability to listen to the conversation.  This information cannot be transferred to web analytics.  Therefore, we decided to give our clients a minimal set of reports so that they can understand what the conversion is to calls without even looking at web analytics.  Reports are currently under development, therefore temporarily unavailable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/193/ead/e99/193eade9960ba9082b4c4e6962093129.png"><br>  <em><font color="#999999">Sipuni Call Tracking Sample in Google Analytics</font></em> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#2298D5">Features of our technology</font> </h2><br>  Through the use of web sockets, we can issue a dynamic phone number and take it from the page, even if the visitor does not move around the site.  Of course, taking the number, we replace it with the default number. <br><br>  Phone numbers in the transition from one site to another "defend" within 7 days.  At first we had a period of one day, but this turned out to be obviously not enough, and we increased it to a week.  This almost completely eliminates collisions for many sites.  If visitors to a site record a number and call after 7 days, we can increase this period individually. <br><br>  For a long time, it was not possible to achieve tracking accuracy of more than 60% of all incoming calls.  Now the accuracy is from 70 to 85% for different sites.  This is already a good result, but we continue to improve it. <br><br>  It is important to understand that dynamic call tracking is a statistical tool: as in Google Analytics, there is no point in drawing conclusions based on one visitor.  In call tracking, it is important to gather enough information before building patterns and making decisions. <br><br>  Tracking accuracy of about 80% already shows useful information about callers who called.  In addition, you can increase the accuracy by narrowing tracking down to certain channels, for example, only traffic from VKontakte.  Soon our users will have such an opportunity. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#2298D5">Technological secrets</font> </h2><br>  The whole project is written in Python.  We use Tornado server and RabbitMQ message queue to work with webboxes.  Tornado is an extensible and non-blocking web server that is distinguished by high speed.  RabbitMQ as a message broker takes care of all the processing of mass messages and their routing. <br><br>  We have a mode when the phone number is shown not immediately, but after some time.  For many sites, you can safely show the number after 50 seconds after a visitor has entered the site.  This is due to the fact that people do not call immediately, but first they get acquainted with the site. <br><br>  If you look at the statistics, any site has visitors who leave almost immediately.  Due to the delay in displaying the number, it is possible to economically use the number pool. <br><br>  It happens that the visitor opens the tab and leaves for an hour.  In order not to keep the number, we ‚Äúselect‚Äù it and replace it with the default number.  Thanks to web-based software, there is a constant connection with the browser.  If the user has several tabs open, then all of them change the number. <br><br>  During one of the brainstorming sessions, we found a solution - to use several numbers by default.  One is shown at the beginning, before the dynamic number appears, the second is shown after the number is ‚Äúpicked up‚Äù, if the dynamic number has been displayed.  By calls to these numbers by default, you can understand how many calls we have missed and at what interval, and, accordingly, adjust the delay time and the number display time. <br><br>  We invite everyone who needs to track customer calls.
