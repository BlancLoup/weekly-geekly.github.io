Then the register was empty - neither the software brought in it, nor applications for introduction there was not.  But the application form on the site was. <br><br>  Yesterday it became known that the first applications did arrive.  On January 13, the Ministry of Communications held the first meeting of the expert council on Russian software, at which these applications were considered. <a name="habracut"></a>  The ministry reported that more than a hundred applications had already been filed through the registry operator‚Äôs website since the beginning of the year.

      A source familiar with the meeting told CNews that about half of the first ready applications concern <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25D0%25A1">1C</a> products (they called Accountancy, Theater, Museum and electronic tutorials).  The developer plans to include about 600 products in the registry. <br><br>  Another five applications fell on New Cloud Technologies.  The Council will soon consider applications for <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D0%259E%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581">‚ÄúMyOffice‚Äù</a> products, which are scheduled to begin selling through distributors from February 2016: ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù, ‚ÄúProfessional‚Äù, ‚ÄúMail‚Äù, ‚ÄúPrivate Cloud‚Äù and ‚ÄúStorage‚Äù. <br><br>  From other well-known companies whose applications are moving to the stage of consideration, the source recalled <a href="http://www.raidix.ru/products/">Raidix</a> . <br><br>  Attempts to sell applications for the inclusion in the registry of domestic software of any localized products of Western vendors have not yet been fixed. <br><br>  The Association of European Businesses had previously <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/20840/">requested that</a> localized foreign software be incorporated into the created registry of domestic software.  The largest foreign IT companies represented by the Director General of the Association of European Businesses ( <a href="http://www.aebrus.ru/ru/">AEB</a> ) Frank Schauff were asked to postpone the entry into force of the law from January 1 to July 1, 2016. <br><br>  SAP CIS Director General Vyacheslav Orekhov notes that localization of production in the company implies ‚Äúprocedures for transferring the software creation process to Russia: development, training, service support and data center centers‚Äù.  ‚ÄúSpecific criteria for considering a company or a product as localized should be defined in a dialogue between business and the regulator,‚Äù he said.  While the dialogue did not work. <br><br>  The meeting of the application review board was chaired by Nikolai Nikiforov, head of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media.  In addition, it was attended by representatives of the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Ministry of Finance, the Pension Fund, the Federal Antimonopoly Service, as well as the Federation Council, development institutions and industry associations of software developers. <br><br>  Decisions of the expert body are taken by a simple majority of votes of its members participating in the meeting, including remotely.  In case of equality of votes, the vote of the chairman is decisive.  ‚ÄúThe basic condition for the work of the board is that officials, representatives of departments can not have more than 40% of the votes in it, while representatives of the IT industry - those in whose interests the reform is implemented - should have at least 50% of the votes.  Only at the level of federal authorities we estimate an order for IT products and services at 80 billion rubles, the same amount is made up of regional and municipal IT state orders, ‚ÄùNikiforov <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/2016-01-13_1cmojofis_i_raidix_poprosili_priznat_ih">told</a> CNews. <br><br>  The law obliging state agencies to submit a written argument for the purchase of foreign software from January 1, 2016 was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin at the end of June. <br><br>  From January 1, 2016, the state customer will have to argue his choice in favor of foreign software, if his Russian counterparts in a specially created registry of domestic software.  The software should belong to the state, the municipality, a Russian non-profit organization or company with a share of Russian beneficiaries of more than 50% - this is the main criterion that makes it possible to consider software as domestic. <br><br><h4>  How to apply </h4><br>  You can apply for inclusion in the register on January 1, 2016 on the specialized website reestr.minsvyaz.ru.  All registered applications will be published on it in the appropriate section. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297868/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297868/</a></p>
