Let's see how to create an effective newsletter for your users. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To make a truly attractive and literate letter, it is worth remembering these five questions: <br>  Why, What, To, When and Where.

    <h2>  1. Why are you creating this newsletter? </h2><br>  Always ask yourself this question: why do you need this letter?  After all, every message you send to a client should serve a clearly stated goal - maybe you want your client to register on your site, or maybe this offer to switch to a new tariff?  Knowing exactly what you want to achieve from the client, you will be able to build a competent letter structure and calculate the effect that the letter should have. <br><br><br>  Let's look at how this happens in the <strong><a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D5voprosov%26utm_campaign%3Demail-marketing">Carrot Quest</a></strong> .  In addition to tracking standard metrics for mailings (opened the letter, clicked on the link), we can build a funnel and see how this letter affected the further actions of these users.  For example, if you send a letter with an offer to try your new product (in the funnel you will see how many users who read the letter, eventually bought a new product). <br><br>  This is achieved through the integration of Carrot Quest with Mixpanel, the setup takes just a couple of minutes.  Here is our example of such a letter.  This is a letter with a lesson, the purpose of which is to induce the user to try the trigger letters in our service.  The main goal - the user will create a trigger message. <br><br>  We collect only 3 actions: the letter is sent - the letter is read - created a trigger message.  This will help not only to evaluate the effectiveness of the letter, but also to test it for different audiences and make the best option for each.  This is personalization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/983/924/474/9839244747283718571f2a565714c4e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This way, you can track how your posts have influenced users.  For example, did users buy after writing or read information about a new service, and many other scenarios. <br><br><h2>  2. What do you say? </h2><br>  In <strong><a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegan%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D5voprosov%26utm_campaign%3Demail-marketing">Carrot Quest,</a></strong> we are well aware of the full value of personalizing communication with a customer: this is the whole point!  Regardless of what goals you intend to achieve with a letter, there are five key parameters for the content of your letter.  Try to deal with them and understand them, otherwise there will be no point in reading further. <br><ul><li>  If you already know the username, then try to contact in the message by name.  For example - hello, Dima.  In the service it is very simple to do, you need to put the parameter {{user ['$ name']}}, when sending, it will substitute the user name.  You can also insert any user properties that you collect in the Carrot Quest (for example, last name, city, product that the user was browsing, etc.); </li><li>  Be concise.  Your message should be moderately capacious and have a clear message, otherwise, the client will quickly stop reading it; </li><li>  Be polite and delicate.  This is the key to communicating.  Do not use specific jargon from your sphere, do not forget that not all clients are experts in your business; </li><li>  Control the style of communication.  With the growth of the company, do not forget to introduce a common style of communication for all. </li><li>  Immediately go to the point, without long introductions.  Do not forget that the client has something to do besides looking through your letters. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  3. Who do you write to? </h2><br>  The identity of the addressee determines everything.  In Carrot Quest, we found the right approach to segmentation and delimiting a huge customer base.  We make our communication with the client meaningful and personalized. <br><br>  It all starts with analyzing the client.  It does not make the slightest sense to communicate with all customers at once, It is much more logical to segment customers by the type of their activity.  For example, focus on customers who have not tried new features of your service or a new product, and tell them about them.  Do not try to tell them about what they have already used, it is ineffective. <br><br><br><br>  You need to know everything about the client in order to personalize your message as much as possible.  Here's what each user's card looks like in Carrot Quest: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b50/09d/b74/b5009db747a753657b43284cdcdb082d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The card and the service collects all the information about the user: what is his name, where did he come from, what pages did he visit, what did he enter, what buttons did he press and more.  Further, these clients can be segmented by different filters. <br><br>  For example, customers who have not tried your new products and services.  You can de-segment them and create a personalized letter.  At the same time, you are not ‚Äúunloading‚Äù those who have already used these new services or products. <br><br><h2>  4. When exactly do you send the message? </h2><br>  To achieve the maximum effect from each letter, you should send them in suitable, precisely verified time.  But how to understand when you need to send a letter to the client, if you have a large and diverse customer base? <br><br>  To get started is to create a kind of schedule for distribution.  It is worthwhile to include functions, products, and features untested by the client in this table, distributing information over a time period. <br><br>  Start with a simple time frame on which you can mark key moments and events at the moment of which, as you think, the client just needs to read an important message from you!  In the course of increasing customer immersion in your service or company products, he needs to be given the opportunity to evaluate new opportunities for using your product.  Make travel notes for the customer.  This is a great way to remind you of the value of your product. <br><br>  In <strong><a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dnegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D5voprosov%26utm_campaign%3Demail-marketing">Carrot Quest,</a></strong> we use letters with lessons, which are sent sequentially after the user's registration.  They are designed to tell everything about the product and help the user as they dive into the service. <br><br><h2>  5. Where does the letter go? </h2><br>  The bottom line is that it is important to remember not only about the addressee of the letter, but also about WHERE he is going to read the letter.  And not only: from which device will the client sit?  All this is of great importance on the effectiveness and efficiency of the letter. <br><br>  Any external irritant can prevent your writing: children, news, physical activity, social networks.  In the morning, without really opening your eyes, you can easily miss the letter.  Do not think that in the morning users are all consciously browsing mail and analyzing every letter. <br><br>  Chatting is much better in this regard and always on topic.  It is worth considering that most often such messages are received by the user when he sits on the Net after dinner or in the evening on the sofa. <br><br><br><br>  It is not easy to get a client to come in, read, and become interested in your letter.  However, if you use these five questions before planning a message, it can be invaluable.  Each post has its own place, time and content.  Only in this case you will receive feedback from the client. <br><br>  With pleasure, the <strong><a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D5voprosov%26utm_campaign%3Demail-marketing">Carrot Quest</a></strong> team is a service for automating Internet marketing (which combines eCRM, online chat, email distribution, pop-ups and web analytics). <br><br>  Some of the information is translated from the book "Customer Enagagement". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296526/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296526/</a></p>
