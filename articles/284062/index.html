The format of the conference is quite interesting: 15 owners of online stores talk about their business.  With the permission of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/saidnavy">Alexander Safonov</a> (the managing partner of the online store of additional auto equipment and electronics <a href="http://realxenon.ru/">RealAvto</a> , which is now seriously diversified: sports, goods for children, hunting and fishing, and much more), I suggest reading the text version of his speech. <br><br>  For information: per month the site realxenon.ru visits, according to the data for December 2014 and January 2015, more than half a million users doing more than one and a half million views.  In 2014, more than 33 thousand orders were issued.  In addition to the main part about the creation and development of the store, Alexander shares his experience in overcoming crises (in the entire history of their store went through 2 crises: economic in 2008 and industry in 2010, and also successfully copes with the crisis of 2014-2015). <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b><b>Safonov Alexander</b></b> : In a few words about yourself.  My name is Alexander, I have been creating and managing Internet projects since 2003, from the moment I moved from Russia to Germany.  At the moment I constantly live in Germany and, in my opinion, I manage quite successfully remotely all projects that are located mainly in Russia.  The team and offices are located in Moscow, Belarus and Germany.  You can say that I am all over the world. <br><br>  My advantage as a manager and a managing partner for an online store and generally internet projects is that I worked before, let's call it the ‚Äúdark side‚Äù, that is, I was a service person.  I was engaged in SEO, worked for a very long time and successfully in payment systems, again, as a partner, and learned the main truth for myself: all service providers are bad, because they absolutely do not understand what shops need, and they do it according to the principle: ‚ÄúWe have done - use.  And this is not to be done.  Therefore, I went to the shops finally, and my main project today after journalism and many other informational publications is RealAuto.  This year we will be 10 years old, around November, I will not name the exact date.  It is from its very foundation that I work, I work for the good of the store, I invest in its development.  Around the store, I will build my speech.  I did not prepare presentations, figures, nothing, because I understand that in the morning it is hard to take numbers and graphics.  To whom the numbers are interesting, I will tell you separately - come up, then share. <br><br>  As I was told, the general theme of today is a crisis: what to do, how to be, what steps to take.  Practically in 10 years of operation, our store went through three crises: 2008, in 2010 we had an intra-industry crisis, which completely turned everything upside down and made a new store history, and today what is happening in the country is also a crisis for us.  I will dwell on each one in more detail, it will be interesting to someone, not to someone, some steps can be adopted. <br><br>  About Shop.  The store is currently the leader in the Russian Internet segment on our subject of additional automotive equipment ("dopavtotoborudovanie") and electronics.  Not to be confused with tires, wheels, cars.  The car market, in my opinion, is divided into three parts: the cars themselves, spare parts and tires-wheels, and our dopavtooborudovanie and electronics.  I do not take servicers (in fact, this is the fourth segment).  I refer to spare parts as tires and wheels, because it is iron. <br><br>  In 2014, we accepted 33 thousand 294 orders.  What of them was done, I will not say now in numbers.  Who is interesting - I will tell later.  Quite a lot we do.  This was an increase of 40% compared to 2013.  In 2015, I expect a fall, but what will happen - we'll see in a year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d06/e15/556/d06e15556d774b47b133b2119465b28e.jpg"><br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe store.  We all create some shops here.  Mostly here are the people who created, either want to create, or work on the development of their stores.  Everyone says: ‚ÄúFor a store to be successful, you need to love things, you need to understand how to plan things.‚Äù  Nothing like this. <br><br>  The store began with such a story that Vitali - he, unfortunately, had not yet arrived - that is, the owner, my friend, partner, and even now a relative, once came to friends in 2005, and they said: ‚ÄúWhat do you do nonsense?  Take our goods and trade. " <br><br>  It was xenon.  That is, there Vitaly was given the goods, they said: ‚ÄúTake it, someday you will give money for it‚Äù.  What did he do?  He thought: ‚ÄúOkay, 2005, you have to go to the Internet‚Äù.  I found myself cheap hosting, they gave some kind of store platform.  Cool, here's the store, here's the product, you have to sell.  How to sell?  Hmm, search.  He was looking for hosting in the search.  Got on some optimizer forums, started looking for someone, found me, and I worked for him for $ 80 for five years.  In fact, for five years I received $ 80 in salary, came or flew for a weekend to Moscow, we had a wonderful time, and that was enough for me, because I had other major projects. <br><br>  Therefore, the first crisis, 2008, was absolutely not noticed for us, because it was a three-person store, such a family-owned store.  Insane 300-500% margin on the product, and the goods were given us all this time without money.  That is, we took, took, took, and then someday: <br><br>  - Oh, you owe us a couple of millions. <br><br>  - Well, okay, let's bring it on the weekend. <br><br>  Absolutely the crisis is not it, but he played into the hands.  We realized that, sooner or later, it will end, because suppliers have already begun to say that the product has become much more expensive, then the dollar also played some joke, and something must be done.  Vitaly left the business absolutely, he went to develop for himself the ‚Äúnew old‚Äù - he recalled the 1990s when he was carrying AvtoVAZ spare parts from the Talyatynsky plant and selling them on the market.  He opened several xenon pavilions in the automotive markets in Moscow. <br><br>  So we worked for three years.  In 2010, the state told us: "Dude, everything is great, but xenon is banned."  In general, everything flew.  I then arrived, lived a year in Russia, here in Moscow, actively began to promote information projects.  Acne came to me, called, said: ‚ÄúSash, I have two news, both are bad: I am getting divorced, and we have no money, we are closing, we have several million debts.  What do we do?".  Cool, great.  Then I studied at the RMA, and there I defended a diploma in exit strategy from the crisis.  We have closed absolutely everything, we left ‚Äúone good‚Äù, and this was our industry crisis, which told us what to do. <br><br>  So, the steps that you can take and need, in my opinion, when you have some kind of internal crisis: the crisis of the company, the crisis of the industry, the crisis of the supplier and so on. <br><br>  It is clear to reduce all possible costs.  For us, it was the closure of absolutely all stores in Moscow, all points of sale, pavilions, markets and everything, and to abandon the goods.  That is, we took the goods, gave it away for debts, should still have some money, and thought about what to trade further.  We have completely redesigned the online store and expanded the range at once by two thousand times, that is, we have become the dopavtooborudovanie and electronics. <br><br>  We cut costs, close everything we can, create a large storefront.  The showcase has become really good, big, I would say huge.  Found suppliers.  They asked, begged.  Nobody knew us, nobody needs us.  It doesn't matter that you are five years old, but you are none at all.  Here, thanks to our friends and partners, with whom we worked five years before.  They vouched for us, said: "They are great, let's work." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/765/466/9c3/7654669c3f7b467a914f713f41789986.jpg"><br><br>  Great product line, you have to sell.  How to sell?  Where to get people?  And so on.  The next step, which is very important.  Small businesses, even small ones, and such pocket online stores start, as a rule, from what?  They invited a friend, invited a brother, a matchmaker, a relative, and begin to work with them.  He is not motivated at all, he doesn't care.  It seems to be a pity for friendship, on the other hand, it is a pity for a relative, on the third hand, for my children, they must be fed.  Since 2010 (a new era in our store) during the first year I was engaged in proving to the project owner that the people who are now working should be removed.  These were our friends, with whom we worked for many years, went to the bathhouse, raised children together.  But business is business, and rest is rest.  Someone understood me, some did not.  One of these people organized, as a result, their successful business, the second person does not communicate with me for five years.  So he wasn't such a great friend ... probably.  Remove not only inefficient people (they are all effective) - remove those people with whom you simply cannot go on ideologically.  In my opinion, this is true.  And do business with friends, with relatives, only with those with whom there will be one ideology. <br><br>  Removing everyone in Moscow, I thought: ‚ÄúCool.  It is necessary to reduce costs in this direction. ‚Äù  I have a friend Andrei Poddubny - he is the ideologue of the Belarusian Drupal, that is, Drupal.by is his project, he supports international development in Belarus.  And since he himself was in Belarus, he told me: ‚ÄúSash, that you in Moscow pay people money, rent expensive premises?  What will you do next? ‚Äù, I said:‚Äú And what is there? ‚Äù, Andrei:‚Äú Come to Belarus. ‚Äù  So for the first time I ended up in the city of Mogilev, and fell in love with him, fell in love with this country, fell in love with what was happening there, and started building a company there.  The company still exists today, it is engaged in project management.  So an important step for us was - this is the removal of all that is possible, from Moscow to Mogilev.  Today it is: the department of editors, this is all development (programmers, designers), a call center.  But he (the call center) was much later, in 2012, when Vitalik arrived in Mogilyov, literally spat on girls (call center employees), the author‚Äôs comment to which he said: ‚ÄúYou can never sell This is our product.  It is complicated, you will not understand it, you will be called by customers who will say: ‚ÄúCan I connect with a boy?  Because you are stupid blondes ‚Äù.  This was done on purpose.  The girls got angry, went through classroom training, and they trade very well.  As a result, now 99.9% of calls and all communication with customers does not take place with manager-boys in Moscow, who are specialists, namely, girls who are in Mogilev.  Thus, we have reduced the costs of payroll, rent, etc., etc., at that time every five.  Belarus was insanely cheap country. <br><br>  I'll run ahead and say now: if someone plans to take something out of Moscow, look at Ukraine.  In Ukraine, there are very smart, kind and hardworking people, and now they are worth a penny.  I look there. <br><br>  <b>Question from the audience</b> : Talk is not confused? <br><br>  <b>Alexander Safonov</b> : At one time they said something similar.  We have 30 phone numbers, all the main cities of Russia, and people think that they call their city, and there the girl takes: <br><br>  - Hello, online store, hello. <br><br>  - Girl, are you from Moscow? <br><br>  - Yes, and sho? <br><br>  In Belarus, the talk is extremely rare, after all, it‚Äôs not like in Ukraine, so we found people there.  At first they focused on this.  Now, nonsense, you can find people in Ukraine who will not speak with a noticeable accent, people there can speak "purely".  It's okay  I am not embarrassed, this is not Tajikistan, after all. <br><br>  So, it was such a big milestone that made me literally live in Mogilev, and not at home.  I am happy, I am at home for four months of the year, the rest of the time I travel somewhere, travel and so on.  On the other hand, it gave me the opportunity to create a great team that works great, is functioning, and, unfortunately, which I am now closing in a new way, but more on that later. <br><br>  Let's go further.  The steps that have been taken, I told.  The internal crisis for us was painless.  Then there were several successful years of growth, crazy and wild growth of two or three times a year.  As a result, we have reached the point that we are today.  In 2013, we realized that we can do quite a lot for us, but we make absolutely no profit, and it became very sad.  The last two years I have been carrying an ideology in eCommerce such that if you are a store, then you should be a business, and if you are a business, then you should be about money.  If you are not about money, you do not have a business, but a hobby.  If you leave, the business will not work, then you do not have a shop, you have, again, a hobby that is tied to you. <br><br>  I can leave, Vitalik can leave, everything will work for us, and we earn money.  So, we dedicated the year 2013-2014 to the fact that ‚Äúlet's make money‚Äù. <br><br>  We began to review suppliers.  Reconsider your suppliers, open the door to them with their feet, and they will listen to you, in fact, no matter how much you turn around.  Just tell them your potential.  Having explained our potential, we began to earn money, leaving everything as it is, but after talking with suppliers. <br><br>  In 2014, we made more than 33 thousand orders, in 2013 it was just over 25 thousand units.  Growth was not as big as I expected. <br><br>  Now for the next crisis, as the time for speaking is limited.  I will not say how and what we do (logistics and the like).  If you ask a question, I will tell you about our internal kitchen.  Now time, unfortunately, is not enough. <br><br>  In 2014, I planned to grow three times.  Under this case, a new wonderful office was taken under 300 square meters with a billiard, with a TV, a PlayStation, so that people feel comfortable, even with a shower - everything is as it should be.  We moved, began to recruit staff, everything is fine.  All, perhaps, the problem of personnel - the main problem.  This is a headache.  Everyone wants to work, everyone wants to get paid, but no one wants to do this job, everyone wants to just work.  So, before the crisis came into the country, it came to our subject.  The crisis has a great impact on automatics.  In the summer of 2014, the car market in Russia fell by half, that is, it became exactly two times lower than in July 2013.  This is scary, in fact, because it will catch up with us and all other people who provide and equip vehicles for a long, long time.  And it was then that the market began to fall, and we began to fall, and in the spring we began to take steps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5c/cf8/116/a5ccf8116c374e32b1d916005acb84e9.jpg"><br><br>  So what to do in this crisis, in the next financial crisis, the crisis of the markets and other things.  Now, in general, everything is very sad for many, everything is fine with us. <br><br>  The first thing we did was that we decided to deal not only with automotive topics, we said: ‚ÄúYes, we are cool, we sell both this and that.  Let's sell something else. ‚Äù <br><br>  On New Year's Eve we sold Christmas trees (in 2013), in 2014 we sold 10 times more of these goods.  We started selling barbecues, we started selling products for fishing and stuff, that is, everything that a car enthusiast can do outside the car, we sell. <br><br>  We went further - we started selling medical equipment.  Nobody cares that the domain is called RealXenon.ru, because it is RealAuto, because it can be RealMed, Real anything.  For half a year we are preparing a redesign, we will soon come out in a completely different form, literally from week to week, and we will sell everything.  Auto - this is our main, but in order not to subside along with the market, we went from automatics, went to other subjects. <br><br>  But since there is not much money, we start working as a marketplace.  Marketplace do many.  But we do not like Wikimart and others.  We make an exclusive affiliate marketplace, that is, for every topic, if we start it, we take one partner with whom we work long and dreary, adjust and so on. <br><br>  We have tested our partners in two years.  We work great.  We get a small commission, but we do what we can, they do what they can.  We do not know how to do logistics, so logistics is our weakness.  If someone wants to offer us a cool logistics, I am ready to talk.  This is what we did, knowing that the car market is falling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/766/cdb/ec0/766cdbec05934c779527272db3fcc75b.jpg"><br><br>  Everyone says, "Let's cut costs."  How to cut costs?  They say to me: ‚ÄúDismiss inefficient people.‚Äù  Guys, we just had no ineffective people.  I do not understand people who work inefficient people.  Therefore, we just cut people.  How, where did we go?  Over the past three years we have invested millions of rubles in the future, in development.  We had a very strong IT development.  We have invested in the study of markets, products, in some analysts, in the writing of our CRM and other systems.  We use only our own.  This "eats" a lot of money.  That is why ‚ÄúIT people‚Äù we broke up (fired) first thing.  They were also designers. <br><br>  I myself am a project manager in one of the formations, I stayed, I can not be fired.  I will not fire myself.  And I removed all the rest.  Now left only one programmer.  We cannot do without programmers.  That is, we gave up growth, we decided for ourselves: ‚ÄúWe fix, fix profits and development, we will not develop this year, we will simply work, we will not invest in the future now.‚Äù  This is a concrete step, how to reduce costs.  For us it was a big step to reduce costs. <br><br>  Further, what we did was we started working with marketing more deeply, that is, we started counting money not as they were previously considered according to the principle: ‚ÄúLet's bring a client, he will cost us 100 rubles, we will earn 90 rubles on it, and tomorrow we will be second , third, fifth sales will earn some more money, and make a profit. " <br><br>  This is nonsense and nonsense.  I talked to many people.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most, it seems, like, in RuNet, effective people who say: ‚ÄúOh, we are doing the second and third sales,‚Äù they honestly admitted: ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt work, Sasha. Not for Russia, not about Russia. ‚Äù We abandoned the idea: "Let us catch up with the client by repeated sale." It does not work, at least with us. Earn this money immediately. The client came, earned - goodbye. There will be a second sale - it will be cool. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We stopped spending on gifts. We really gave gifts. Now we have started looking for partners who give these gifts for us. It works, it is loyalty, people really get a phone number, a trip, who wants - come to us, give presents, we will give you a base, reach 1.5 million users during the promotion.</font></font><br><br>    ?      .   ,  ,   ,   .         300   .      .     ‚Äî   .        270     230     .       500,     300. 200  ‚Äî    .     ,    .      ,   ,  ,   -.  ,  , ,          ,   : 500       ,        .     .   ,   ,   ,     ,     .   ,    ,     ,      ,     ,      ,   -.  How to do it?<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here is the specifics.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f0/d65/559/3f0d65559fb04c0295e527e5b84a610d.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We used to work a wonderful person who had worked as a carrier for 20 years in Moscow. He was a taxi driver official fleet, he drove everything that only fiddles. And then he got an education when he got tired of the steering wheel and became a great logistician. And he came to us and said: ‚ÄúI will ruin everything for you, because I know Moscow, I went, I know traffic jams and everything.‚Äù He did everything perfectly. We worked on his system. They thought: ‚ÄúWhat if it is ineffective?‚Äù. We came to one company that provides route automation services. They showed us how and what they are supposed to do, and how we do logistics, namely the movement of drivers, the distribution of points and so on. And we were able to dismiss 20% of drivers. What did they do it on? Doing our logistics, we thought about how to drive around Moscow in traffic jams. And these guys take into account the time the driver is at the supplier,because with one supplier you are five minutes, quickly unloaded, and another supplier is 40 minutes. And taking into account this time, waste of driver's time, being at the supplier - these are the expenses that simply make logistics much more expensive. We are now beginning to optimize these expenses. Everything is great, we all have time, despite traffic jams and winter slush. Less drivers, more efficiency.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What other steps? We have 99% of the goods - imports. We have a number of our products, which we ourselves produce. Our product is in currency. If you go to Yandex.Market today, then the head unit, which costs 43,000, costs 28,000 there. You will never buy it for 28 thousand rubles, you will call the store, and they will tell you: ‚ÄúGuys, it costs more‚Äù, but you will be sold to it, say, for 35-39 thousand rubles. We do not sell cheaply, we sell expensively, that is, we have raised prices since November for everything, twice already, and we are buying from us. We have no drop in sales. January, on the contrary, is abnormal. I expected a fall, I expect a stronger fall. Believe me, you can - no, I'm preparing for it. It will not be - then I will go to profit, and again I will go to rest somewhere for a long time with my team. I expect a fall.January is anomalous - we doubled the prices, our sales increased by 30%. This is great and wonderful. If not for the two weeks that the country saw, maybe it would be even better. That is, sell high. How to sell high is a topic for another conversation. We do it.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What else have we done, in my opinion, the last and most important thing? We refused from such positions as director and so on. All people must do the work. We do not have people who organize this work. Each person took over a pool of tasks. Let's just say, the former director general of the Mogilev office, having gone to the decree, assumed the position of "problem". That is, she is the person who solves problems. There are always problems with suppliers, problems with customers, returns, some complex orders, when a customer tears and throws, and before that certain employees did it, but they cannot do it quickly, they do not always have authority to do so. As a person says: "It does not work for me, give him a thousand dollars." And he cannot accept this risk. He has certain job descriptions.Each of our employees has a job description. I hope you have it all. It helps a lot - job description, where everything is spelled out absolutely. But the first point is: "Turn on your head." We have it. This is the official approach to people - the availability of job descriptions.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No need to bring to situations like in "Beeline", "Megaphone", and so on, where this person sits: "And if you have it, do it." And you talk to the robot: first point - think, but follow the instructions, but think what you are doing according to the instructions. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These tasks, they are very distracted and loaded. We removed them from those who do, in our opinion, should not, and hung up their performance on the manual. First, the leaders are now busy 24 hours a day, insanely demotivated to do some nonsense, they want to throw it all off, but in order to throw it off, you have to earn money. Everything is great, we strive to make money. This is what we did.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df8/43f/feb/df843ffebd4e432ba58fc714dd645c2f.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now on the internal work of the store absolutely any questions. I will answer the numbers as we do. Anything, in principle, I can tell. Or how we do our duties, what I do, what Moscow does. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Preobrazhensky Boris</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : I will ask the first question. You say: "Sales have grown." First, they grew in money or in pieces? </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander Safonov</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : They grew exactly in units by 30%. I do not take a comparison with the last year (January - this is understandable, we grew up), namely, what the dynamics for 2014 was. November and December, I do not take. December I threw out of the statistics. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Davlet Suleymanov</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : Sasha, one more question. What about advertising? In a crisis, what marketing tools did you use? </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Safonov Alexander</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: In a crisis, we actively went to Yandex.Market, Direct, all that is possible, something that we used to be extremely reluctant and little. But through the management and automation systems, who knows, in November we nevertheless reached an agreement with Guyam Karapetyan, who spoke here frequently at you, Guy does us marketing. I do not do more marketing. We took the person who will do it, in my opinion, more effectively than me. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Davlet Suleymanov</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : Has the cost of a client increased or decreased? </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Safonov Alexander</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: Here the question is as follows. Those main channels that gave 95% of traffic earlier, they were very cheap for us. 70 rubles - client's input, 150 rubles - completed order, figuratively speaking, plus or minus. Yandex.Direct was 250 rubles, now 350 rubles, but not KPI, but CPO. The cost of one order, one order was 250 rubles in November, when Guy and I were talking. Now I said: ‚ÄúWell, now it is 350 rubles,‚Äù but this is the average for the hospital. There are goods, where there are a thousand rubles, 1500 rubles even ... 350 rubles is an average in a hospital, something that I am ready to pay for a client in general. I can, in fact, pay 500 rubles, but I do not want to. I believe that it‚Äôs better to give these 150 rubles to some employee who will be in charge of placing an order and will issue this order with high quality. That is the answer: "the cost of attracting a client has not changed for us yet."</font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Question from the audience</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : are you going to expand within one platform, or to develop several? </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander Safonov</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : This is one place. Ideologically - this is one site and this is one store. Roughly speaking, we can enter there now (I can show the password with a new design and marketplace), I can not show you the password, but if you are interested, you will come up and I will show you the new design. And what will it look like? AliExpress have seen everything? Here is something similar in hierarchy. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We will sell different subjects, but as I said, not all in a row. We take a new partner. Suppose the subject of clothing. I take Davlet ( </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Davlet Suleymanov</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - one of the organizers of the PraktikaDays conference, the owner of a chain of fashion boutiques </font></font><a href="http://www.rezedasuleyman.com/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rezeda Suleyman</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- approx. author), soot, he teaches my people to sell clothes. It is he who is the specific person in my company who is fully responsible for this area. Yes, the entrance is divided, but he is responsible for that. That is, it will be technologically one site, but inside the work will be carried out by department: clothing department, automobile department, children's department, and so on. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Question from the audience</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : Alexander, the question is this. You have increased the window 2 thousand times. This is a serious step. How was this done? How to work with suppliers? That is, they bought it, sold it, or sold it, then bought it? </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Safonov Alexander</font></font></b> :  2       2010 ,        .      40 . ,     20-25 . ‚Äì   ,  15-20 .,    . <br><br>     ?     2010   , : ¬´  .   .     ¬ª.  It is not right.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We do not have the money to buy even one thing at a time. We have analysts who say: "This is what they buy every day, we buy it at the warehouse." Now, maybe 3-5 million. In the goods in stock, not more, at the pick-up point or somewhere nearby. All the rest is communication with suppliers. We have leftovers. Some suppliers in our assholes are complete, I apologize for not formatting, you get out of them for half a year. An order arrives, we accept it, there is a purchase, in the evening we form route lists, the drivers have left. Regular drivers from us are engaged only in purchases, third-party courier services are engaged in delivery. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Question from the audience</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : Such a system, as I understand it, would not have been possible if all the suppliers were not located within the city where you work? </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Safonov Alexander</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A: Yes, our all suppliers are from Moscow. The region works with us according to the principle: ‚ÄúDudes, do you want to work with us? Give us the goods for sale. ‚Äù We have a couple of suppliers who just brought us the goods, threw them into the warehouse, we do the accounting every few months. Either on demand. That is, we come, we believe - this is so much money. We send some money, then sold, arrived, checked: 100 thousand. They owe us, or half a million we owe them. OK good. Then, yes, regions with us can, all the rest - no. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Question from the audience</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : That is, if your store was located somewhere far beyond the Moscow Ring Road, such a scheme would not work at all, right? </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander Safonov</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : She would have worked. I would just hire drivers who also live outside the Moscow Ring Road, and they would drive.</font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Question from the audience</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : But three thousand kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road? </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander Safonov</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : We have our main colleagues - AutoGSM, the store that does the same, and they are also cool. In some ways we make them, in some ways they rule us. I don't know where their money comes from. They are from Voronezh, or they started from Rostov-on-Don. They have long been conquered and conquered by regions, they live off of it. I know for sure that, being there, they worked for the first years without a large warehouse. They had a delivery there. But they therefore went first to the regions, in the regions it was normal to wait two, three, four weeks. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Question from the audience</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : So, they had a longer order processing time? </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander Safonov</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : Yes. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Question from the audience</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A: That is efficiency, today I did not send the order - no question? </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Safonov Alexander</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : They ordered tomorrow, two days later the transport company received it, then they sent it. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Question from the audience</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : Good afternoon. I have a question about repeat sales. I heard a very bright pain about the fact that if suddenly the order does not pay off after the first sale, then it does not beat you further. In this connection, the question. I understand that you have a large enough base. What proportion of marketing plays in your sales for the year? If it is possible, just by the number of ratios, and how do you work, what do you think about how to strengthen it in 2015? </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Safonov Alexander</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: Our base is, in fact, small. Those who want to receive our e-mail are only 40-50 thousand clients. We do our weekly newsletter. It is not segmented by a fig, it is stupidly ‚Äúon sparrows from a cannon‚Äù. Yes, we connected services this year, started testing, a couple of service providers here at the conference are from the same series. Hooked trigger mailings and so on. Now a wonderful RetailRocket is my favorite test. No sales there. There, the conversion of those letters that they sent out - 3.5%. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Question from the audience</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : Open Rate - 3.5%? </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Safonov Alexander</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: 3.5% is the conversion of orders through them, via trigger mailings of the number of letters they send. But the number of orders is nothing at all, it‚Äôs fie, so I don‚Äôt believe in all this. But I will say this - we just do not know how to cook it. Yes, Guy Karapetyan came here, let him work out his presence. Hope we can. If we can not - part. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Question from the audience</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : You use a call center for all your incoming calls. How does the work, if the employee does not know the answer to the question? What she does? </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Safonov Alexander</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: In 2010, when we went out to Mogilyov ... That is, 10 people were sitting there, today it has become smaller (we are reducing), the girls describe the goods in as much detail as possible, plus there are question-and-answer fields hidden from customers for each product. The operator will find 90% of the answers to the questions on the item card. If suddenly she does not know, she is transferred to the supervisor in Moscow. That is, it translates to Moscow, to a specialist person in that subject, and he will finish off a client. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Question from the audience</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : The second question. I looked at your site. There are many self-collection warehouses and so many local telephones. Are they really effective? </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Safonov Alexander</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: Local phone numbers, as I said, about 20 in Russia. Pickup points are the points of Pickup at SDEC. Yes, we "cheated" in order to be cool in the regions. Palu is such a life hack. He no longer works, he worked two years ago. If you want to sell in the regions, you need regionality. Take the pickup point (no matter whose), put a full stop there, and ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù assigns you a region. Sometimes there were hand checks by Yandex, and we were not assigned a region. Then the designer sits down, at this point the pickup makes you a picture that your signboard is there. I myself call this pick-up point, I say: "Listen, if you have a person, you have a supermegaclient, tell me that we can pick up the goods from such an online store." And they do not cheat. Is it possible to pick up goods from our store?</font></font> Can.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This was enough for Yandex. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And everything, we are in the region, plus we connected local, regional telephone numbers there. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We got there, then made a region in Yandex.Catalog. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such things worked. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now, in my opinion, they no longer work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Try it, I do not know. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These are the pickup points of the shipping company. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But they are really working, they are comfortable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There comes a product, you want - take the money, you want - no. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are sending 100% to the regions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nalozhka - evil. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not kill yourself, do not kill your business overlay. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We do not have the money to give them to the client with a overlay. </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the author: the next conference Practice Days for eCommerce will be held in April-May 2015. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For updates, follow the official </font></font><a href="https://www.facebook.com/praktikadays"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Facebook</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> group </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you liked the material - leave a comment, publish other presentations with the permission of the speakers.</font></font></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284062/</a></p>
