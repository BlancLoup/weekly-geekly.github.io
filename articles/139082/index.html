      In the modern world, the number of personal electronic devices is constantly growing.  In daily communication, an active person is not limited to just one device.  According to a global study by Kaspersky Lab <sup>1</sup> , <b>an average of 3.3 personal electronic devices</b> with Internet access and the ability to store large amounts of information <b>per family in Russia</b> . <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c7/207/951/4c7207951f0e9566b19285233ba61cd1.png" align="right" alt="image"><br><br>  The highest rate of the countries studied was found in Saudi Arabia, where 4.3 households per household.  The least amount of gadgets in the house turned out <b>to</b> be <b>in Romania - only 2.6</b> .  Russia in terms of security devices was on the same positions with Mexico and China. <br><br>  <b>pros</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/438/0bd/da9/4380bdda932664fa76821cc33159623d.png" align="left" alt="image">  From the modern set of personal electronic devices, the most popular in Russia is the desktop PC.  Almost <b>66% of</b> respondents confirmed its presence in the house.  And <b>18.8% of</b> respondents indicated that they have two or more desktops. <br><br>  Laptops also do not lose their relevance due to the combination of high power and mobility: every second family uses them - <b>53.2%</b> .  <b>16.2% of</b> respondents have two or more such devices in the house. <br><br>  More than half of the respondents were owners of ‚Äúsmart phones‚Äù - <b>52.5%</b> , while <b>24.5% of</b> respondents reported that there are two or more smartphones in their families. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/14b/600/991/14b60099145c08ebb4c71ae24d6c2e55.png" align="right" alt="image">  As for such a new-fashioned gadget, like a tablet PC, there are not as many of them as it seems!  Only every tenth respondent, namely <b>10.7%</b> , has already acquired it, and almost as many research participants ( <b>11.3%</b> ) are going to acquire them in the next six months. <br><br>  Already, in Russia, almost <b>6.5% of</b> families in big cities are happy owners of a full set of modern gadgets (home PC, laptop, smartphone, tablet). <br><br>  <b>Minuses</b> <br><br>  Meanwhile, such popularity of personal electronic devices opens up more and more opportunities for cybercriminals.  As you know firsthand, every day a user makes purchases online, communicates in social networks and chat rooms, checks email and surfs on the Internet.  To do this, both home PC or laptop, and a smartphone or tablet on different operating systems can be used equally effectively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/64e/781/813/64e781813f51c8567873597a5c268d61.png" align="left" alt="image">  In 2011, Kaspersky Lab experts observed an intensive growth of malware for most platforms.  Thus, the Windows operating system that dominates among PC users is equally popular among virus writers: the malware for it has increased by <b>80%</b> . <br><br>  Malware for Mac OS also showed a significant increase of <b>35%</b> . <br><br>  Among mobile operating systems, the most increased number of malicious software for 4 platforms.  Closes the rating of Windows Mobile with <b>13%</b> .  Bronze receives Symbian OS with <b>16%</b> . <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/283/366/707/2833667079348bf53e3d879afb3dc684.png" align="right" alt="image">  The Java2ME environment is still a tasty morsel for virus writers, because most simple mobile phones work on its base.  The amount of malware for it has increased by as much as <b>160%</b> . <br><br>  But the ‚Äúchampion‚Äù in increasing the number of malicious programs has become the Android OS.  Believe it or not, at the beginning of 2011 there were about two dozen of them, and closer to the end it was about 2000. This means that the <b>increase in Android malware amounted to almost</b> <b><i><u>12,000%</u></i></b> . <br><br>  <i>Here is such an interesting mathematics.</i>  <i>Of course, we all thought it was not just that, but in honor of the release of our new product Kaspersky ONE to protect the entire fleet of devices at once.</i>  <i>It was thought that it was time to offer users universal protection.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>What do you think, does he need someone at all or not?</i> <br><br>  <sup>1 The</sup> <sub>study of Internet users was conducted by an independent research company O + K specifically for Kaspersky Lab in 20 countries in several stages during 2011.</sub>  <sub>The last wave of the survey took place in October 2011, more than 7,000 users were polled.</sub> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139082/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139082/</a></p>
