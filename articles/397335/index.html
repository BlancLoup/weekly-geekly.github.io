The corresponding <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/statement-on-galaxy-note7">statement</a> was published on the official website of the company. <br><br>  According to the manufacturer, he is taking a similar step as he ‚Äústrives to produce the highest quality products‚Äù and ‚Äútakes incident reports from his customers very seriously.‚Äù <br><br>  According to Samsung, a total of 35 cases of explosion or ignition of Galaxy Note 7 batteries were recorded. Sales in the United States began on August 19, and sales in Europe were scheduled for September 2.  Galaxy Note 7 has not yet reached the Russian Federation - on the territory of Russia, the beginning of the implementation of Galaxy Note 7 was planned on August 26, but was postponed to September 16. <br clear="left"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A number of American consumers have problems with related products and subscriptions that they received from a dealer represented by mobile operators along with the Galaxy Note 7. While there is no single position on this issue: someone leaves additional functions active, someone else has not announced official position.

      The return of the device is made absolutely free of charge without any additional fees for shipment to the manufacturer. <br><br>  The president of Samsung‚Äôs mobile unit, Ko Don Jin, states that the cause of the problems was ‚Äúa small problem during the production process‚Äù, which, however, led to very tangible consequences for several dozen smartphone owners. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HQQOiilJwJ0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <em>Video of one of the owners of Galaxy Note 7, in which the battery caught fire</em> <br><br>  ‚ÄúA small manufacturing problem‚Äù turns a new smartphone into a piece of charred plastic without any hints about the possibility of recovery: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/966/170/9a8/9661709a81f7a9ffffcc7c03a465dced.png" width="800"><br><br>  The manufacturer estimates the return will affect about 10 countries.  Total Samsung will return one million potentially defective devices, the retail value of which in the US is $ 850. <br><br>  At the same time, the Galaxy Note 7 was shipped with a different battery to the main market for Koreans - to China - and they will not respond from the Celestial Empire. <br><br>  A number of users reported that the incident occurred when they charged their smartphone using a USB to Type-C adapter, that is, without using the original Samsung cable. <br><br>  This is not the first time that the batteries in Samsung phones catch fire.  At one time, the story of the explosion of the battery in the Samsung S3, right in the hostess‚Äôs pocket, was widely publicized.  The girl received serious burns of her legs, and the device turned into a piece of charred plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ac8/9e4/b4f/ac89e4b4f84ff6f4ba76d202262d3754.jpg"><br>  Burnt Samsung S3 / <em>Photo: dailymail.co.uk</em> <br><br>  At the beginning of this year, the Samsung Galaxy S6 caught on one American, which, like the new model, was still charging.  The incident occurred at night - it was at this time that many people left their phones charged to start the day with a full battery - and the fact that no one was hurt and the smartphone did not cause a fire was a great success. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/127/c90/2b9/127c902b95a917bc6c1d9d9cf77496e0.jpg"><br>  <em>Samsung Galaxy S6 burned down in March of this year</em> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b3/f10/2ea/3b3f102ea01c565a8f2694b03760e8fb.jpg"><br>  <em>And what's left of his charge</em> <br><br>  It's amazing how often Samsung attacking the same ‚Äúrake‚Äù of flammability of their devices.  Since the time of S3, it is possible that the problem of a spontaneous explosion of the battery has been resolved, however, incidents, both with the new flagships and with the older models standing on the network during charging, continue. <br><br>  How Samsung will solve this already ‚Äúclassic‚Äù problem for itself, if the situation repeats from year to year - it is not clear. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397335/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397335/</a></p>
