  <section class="page js-page"><h1>b2b - serious business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good time, habra users, it so happened that in our team there was a joyful event - moving to a new office.  Fortunately, the process of his choice didn‚Äôt touch me (except, of course, monitoring of people calling at the moment of price announcements), but all the consequences fell on my shoulders.  And it would seem that the difficult thing can be in organizing the workflow of an unassuming team - set up tables, connect phones with the Internet, and enjoy life.  (oh, naive me) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first thing I took the furniture.  Where can I buy some cheap tables?  Memory prompted IKEA, because how many times it was possible to buy cheap good furniture there.  I go enthusiastically to ikea.ru, click on the link ‚ÄúInspiring Solutions for Business Development‚Äù, then on ‚Äúoffice furniture for staff‚Äù and I understand that something is wrong.  I see that they offer me ‚ÄúComputer eruptions‚Äù, though I cannot buy them - 404. For the sake of interest, I look through several more pages - I meet empty sections, 404, texts written by a person who knows Russian even worse than me and absolutely wonderful ‚Äúpseudo-basement‚Äù (try guess what the bottom page of the text).  Yeah, apparently IKEA is so rich that it doesn‚Äôt need any extra customers (By the way, what surprises me is how much love in the pages of the site is scattered nofollow?). <br><br>  In the upset feelings I decide to go online.  It is worth saying that in the past the office was not just bad with the Internet, but worse than ever.  Not only did the local dwarf monopolist want a lot of money, it also provided speed at the dialup level, and it was possible to catch wifi or yota only by leaning out of the window to the waist and holding the laptop with outstretched hands (and it‚Äôs not very convenient to work).  In the new office, at least 3 providers existed, and even caught yota and beeline.  First of all, I went to the websites of the submitted providers.  First on the list was the First Telecom Company, which immediately informed me of the following: <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Unlimited Internet to the office is the <i>most powerful</i> service of the First Telecom company.</b> </blockquote><br>  A call to this wonderful company only confirmed that I work there notable "most powerful".  Our modest request in the form of 2mb anlim was offered to pay a little more than 14 thousand rubles a month (although I still have light faith in people and I hope that this was the price for the connection and we misunderstood each other).

      Next on my list was a local micro-company, which fortunately offered adequate rates and pleasant discounts, although several times more expensive than the ‚Äúhome‚Äù Internet, but this is already the norm in Moscow.  But for the sake of interest (and with a timid hope for a miracle), I went to the Corbina website, chose high-speed Internet for corporate clients, confirmed once again that I was a corporate client, and not accidentally clicked on the link and got to <a href="">b2b.beeline.ru/index. wbp</a> (by the way, the encoding was broken on that page, now it was fixed - progress).  Of course, we talked to a pretty girl from biline, she asked whether I was making the decision, how many people we have and how many competitors ask and promised to write to the post office.  Which, however, did not surprise at all, because the previous companies also actively hinted that they were ready to do better than the competitors, just need to tell them (I really wanted to quibble about penny jot every time). <br><br>  Furniture in the end we certainly bought and connected to the Internet.  But the sediment remained. <br><br>  <i>In no case do I want to say that I discovered America by telling all this, but at a minimum, a strange attitude towards corporate (and, I think, more demanding) customers from existing companies annoyed me so much that I wanted to share.</i>  <i>I am almost sure that those who have ever dealt with have no less problems and stories to enter the new office.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97255/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97255/</a></p>
