      This is probably one of the most impressive and important archaeological finds of all time the existence of historical science.  The fact is that no one thought that the ancient Greeks were so advanced in the study of science and possessed the knowledge and technology that made it possible to create something similar.  Antikythera mechanism showed that we still do not know much about the distant past of mankind. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The device was raised in 1901 from an ancient ship that sank not far from the Greek island of Antikythera (Greek ŒëŒΩœÑŒπŒ∫œçŒ∏Œ∑œÅŒ±) and was discovered by a Greek diver on April 4, 1900.  Dated around 100 BC.  e.  (perhaps before 150 BC. e. or 205 BC. e.).  Stored in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens.  It is not possible to determine more precisely the age of the mechanism, since there were many artifacts on the ship that carried it.  These artifacts were created at the most different times, so the date of the creation of the Anti-Hitter mechanism cannot be tied to anything on the ship. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e75/6f3/6db/e756f36db0c9aa950d400c86cce776dd.jpg"><br>  <i>Photo: The Associated Press</i> <br><br>  The mechanism contained 37 bronze gears in a wooden case, on which were placed dials with hands.  Other devices of similar complexity are unknown in Hellenistic culture.  Approximate dimensions of the assembly are 33 √ó 18 √ó 10 cm. In 2005, the discovery of new fragments of the mechanism <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC">was announced</a> .  In order to restore the position of the gears inside the mineral-covered fragments, they used computed tomography, using x-rays to make volumetric maps of hidden content.  Due to this, it was possible to determine the interrelation of individual components and calculate, if possible, their functional affiliation. <br><br>  Specialists from various branches of science and technology have studied the mechanism for many years, making up a single team - the research group The Antikythera Mechanism Research Project (AMRP).  The study of the mechanism was carried out using the latest achievements of science and technology, including tomography, computer simulation, x-rays and so on.  The team for the study of the mechanism includes astronomers, engineers, archeologists from different countries.  A relatively recent idea was expressed that this is an analog computer predicting the motion of celestial bodies.  In particular, scientists have suggested that this system showed the priests when a solar or lunar eclipse happens.  And it seems that scientists have drawn the right conclusions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/530/ff5/51d/530ff551d8cbecb50caa2fb948715c5d.jpg"><br>  <i>Photo: Petros Giannakouris / Associated Press</i> <br><br>  The fact is that the mechanism was supplied with instructions for use.  The instruction is <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/mapping-eclipses-worlds-first-computer-104147768.html">divided into several</a> parts.  Some texts were located near the elements of the system, some on the surface of the ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù itself.  The overwhelming majority of texts were on surfaces practically destroyed by erosion, and it was only now possible to read the texts found.  To understand the difficulties scientists have encountered, imagine how the characters 1.2 mm in size look engraved on a bronze surface that has been in water for two thousand years.  Until recently, not only to read, but to find such symbols could not be due to the imperfection of the tools available to man.  In total, about 3400 characters (500 words) were found and read.  Although experts suggest that the mechanism was applied about 20 thousand characters (respectively, about 2000-2500 words). <br><br>  Scientists could not only read the found symbols, but also determine that only two people who were working (supposedly) in one workshop put them.  The workshop was located on the island of Rhodes, since the mechanism was ‚Äútuned‚Äù to observe astronomical events at a latitude of 35 ¬∞.  sh.  Perhaps the mechanism was not the only one, but was part of a whole series of similar "devices".  If specialists succeed in proving their point of view, the origin of the system can be connected with such ancient Greek astronomers as Hipparchus (190-120 BC) and Gemin (I century BC).  They conducted a study of "celestial mechanics" on the island of Rhodes.  It was Hipparch and Gemin who lived closest to the indicated latitude during the specified period of time.  About other astronomers who are able to perform a similar work (including in Crete), historians are currently unknown. <br><br>  It is noteworthy that the descriptions that are relevant to <a href="http://gizmodo.com/the-world-s-oldest-computer-may-have-been-used-to-predi-1781749625">solar eclipses</a> , were based on the color of the eclipse itself.  According to experts, this indicates that the device served not only as a scientific tool, with its help they tried to predict the future - both of individual nations and the entire ancient civilization.  ‚ÄúSome colors could indicate positive changes.  If this is so, and we interpreted everything correctly, the mechanism was more an astrological tool than an astronomical instrument, ‚Äùsays one of the members of a team of scientists who studied the mechanism.  The instruction itself is descriptive: here it is as if the observer is told what he should see as a result of the operation of the mechanism.  There are no explanations for the phenomena themselves - the text was clearly made up for a person (people?) Who possessed certain knowledge in astronomy and astrology.  The mechanism showed its owner how the movement of celestial bodies affects the life of the ancient Greeks and their environment, and how celestial bodies will affect the fate of peoples in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/022/19e/925/02219e9250c54dae0fce43d2bfd25136.jpg"><br>  <i>Photo: Petros Giannakouris / Associated Press</i> <br><br>  One of the most interesting questions about the ancient computer - for whom it was created, and where did the customer live?  It may be possible to find out and that - in 2016 they plan to carry out new excavations at the crash site of the ship that was carrying the mechanism.  And if new fragments of the mechanism are found, it may help to complete the puzzle completely.  Or at least complement the existing picture. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372365/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372365/</a></p>
