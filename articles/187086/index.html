When this phone was announced in April, I immediately liked it.  As you can see, the LUMIA style is clearly being played up.  Bright colors, monolithic case, the phone immediately attracts attention and leaves no one indifferent.  Having learned the price of 3,000 rubles, the interest is further enhanced.  The device can be considered an excellent companion for the voracious smartphone, sometimes not reaching the end of the day.  Also pleased with the presence of a second SIM card, which can be installed without turning off the device.  By the evening, the smartphone was discharged, inserted a SIM card from Nokia into it, and then we stay connected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/966/0a4/0d2/9660a40d25579877e4ff1ce5eb966380.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Specifications </h4><br>  <b>Form Factor:</b> Monoblock <br>  <b>Operation System:</b> Series 40 Asha <br>  <b>Screen:</b> 2.4 "320 x 240, 64 thousand colors <br>  <b>GSM network:</b> 850 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 1900 MHz, 2 SIM cards <br>  <b>Communications:</b> WLAN IEEE 802.11 b / g, Bluetooth <br>  <b>Connectors:</b> 2 mm charger, 3.5 mm minijack, microUSB <br>  <b>Battery:</b> BL-4U 1200 mAh <br>  <b>Memory Card Type:</b> MicroSD <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 2 megapixels (1600 x 1200), fixed focus, f / 2.8 <br>  <b>Package Contents:</b> Nokia AC-11 Battery Charger, Nokia BL-4U Battery, 1200 mAh, Nokia Stereo Headset WH-109 <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 111,56011,8 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 99.5 g

    <h4>  Package and package </h4><br>  The phone comes in a bright compact box the size of almost the phone itself.  On the one hand, this is good, on the other - we can guess that inside we will see almost nothing. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f15/434/bdb/f15434bdbbce8092eef81d15e2bf7616.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Indeed, the kit is small: a 220V charger with a 2 mm jack and the simplest WH-109 headset, no answer button, just a microphone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/511/2f2/a04/5112f2a04de68f7bc03761e61cd8af7d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a0/64d/b91/0a064db91a2b5f81aa0911d9bb01ff4e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is no cable for PC synchronization.  The box is made of renewable materials, contains 60% of the materials that are the product of recycling.  Packaging is fully recyclable. <br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  In the hands of the Asha 210 it feels like a durable candy bar, no crackling and no backlash.  Dimensions small 11.5 by 6 cm, thickness 11.8 mm.  The entire surface is made of matte plastic, similar to polycarbonate. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/901/92b/ac7/90192bac7bfa8911833d7f849c7c657e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The familiar Lumia style is recognized, the colors are especially pleasing.  In Russia, it is still sold in black and yellow, blue is expected. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d25/791/36e/d2579136e84ca04ee950741742f42c52.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main glossy part is a navigation block with function keys and a screen.  Since the buttons are black, the prints are not visible so much. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/555/af9/6bc/555af96bc4163375f39cbb7b6fd79333.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The device is perfectly in the hand, there are no sharp corners, it does not slip out of the hands. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ef/f95/956/1eff959567bd2a0e73405f5a12d37b8a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the top there is a 2 mm jack for charging, next to microUSB, by the way, through which you can also charge, then a 3.5 mm mini jack for the headset. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aaa/07a/8cc/aaa07a8cc896c591d9368f7c2976c69d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the left side there is a stub covering the slot for the second SIM card.  The device accepts standard <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">mini-SIM</a> .  That's all, no you need the volume buttons or the off key. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/362/5c3/3ca/3625c33ca52c7cd1c661e9ea0f66c08c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the back of the phone is a camera and speaker grille.  The lid closes the entire back end and holds onto a large number of snaps, somewhat resembling a Galaxy cover. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e29/613/a88/e29613a8897c7f51aa33717d3b02ad09.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The lid is removed simply and very tightly held, nothing staggers.  Under the cover we see the battery and just below the speaker. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dfc/247/37d/dfc24737d0f7494d1bc341fc38d96b8b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the battery slot for SIM-card and MicroSD, the memory can be increased up to 32 GB. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e8/81d/054/3e881d054936dd8c27e6cc317fb54f6f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Keyboard </h4><br>  Of course, it is worthwhile to tell about the Asha 210 keyboard separately. We have a QWERTY keyboard of 37 keys in front of us.  In general, the style of previous QWERTY devices, key sizes and stroke are noticeable.  All keys are convex with a short stroke and good tactile feedback. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee6/c9b/5af/ee6c9b5af0592e2b946cd3a58fb41ad6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main characters are black, Russian letters have a grayish tint.  Also during illumination, there is a noticeable difference between Russian and Latin letters. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ea/e35/156/4eae351566f9cf2535e537e21437821e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's go to the input.  Consider a set of Russian text.  A new text begins with a capital letter, if you need to forcibly put a capital letter, hold down the Shift (second key from the left) and enter a letter.  You can also enable Caps Lock with this key. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1c/634/741/b1c634741119d1e69d12dbced21687f5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you need to put a symbol, for example a question, then we press the letter ‚Äúsh‚Äù and in a second it will change to ‚Äú?‚Äù.  Accordingly, all additional characters that are printed on the keyboard can be entered in this way.  If it is inconvenient for you to hold the key for a long time, then you can simply press the key with the desired symbol with the leftmost button pressed.  For example, it is convenient when you need to enter a long number. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de4/759/d22/de4759d2230123c82cddd0332c6cd958.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is also a separate ‚ÄúSym‚Äù key that will display various smilies and additional characters.  A comma and a dot are placed with a long press on the "x" and "x".  As you can see, the letters ‚Äúe‚Äù and ‚Äú‚Äù did not have enough space to hold ‚Äúy‚Äù and ‚Äúz‚Äù for a long time.  Since the time of the Nokia 5800, the lack of a separate key that would quickly switch to 1-click caused me the inconvenience, I did not wait for this function.  Here, the extreme Ctrl key successfully switches the language without unnecessary gestures.  Successfully work out such familiar combinations as Ctrl + C, Ctrl + X, Ctrl + V, Ctrl + A. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/367/f30/c9f/367f30c9fb0fee03e706114f3ffb85e7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In standby mode, pressing the keys can quickly turn off BlueTooth, Wi-Fi or turn on silent mode.  We also have access to all the buttons of push-button phones, such as assigning various actions when pressing the joystick or function keys.  To the left of the joystick there is a key to which you can assign a quick launch of the application, for example, WhatsApp, in some countries it even has an icon of this popular messenger.  On the right is the quick start camera button. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/582/110/818/58211081831bc1d3a53b3f5cc785a074.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The 2.4 "inch screen of stars from the sky is not enough, even with small deviations, color distortion is noticeable. The screen resolution is 320 by 240 pixels, 169 PPI, 64 thousand colors. But for 3000 rubles it is a normal screen. The brightness value can be set in steps from 1 to 5. <br><br><h4>  Battery </h4><br>  The removable BL-4U battery with a capacity of 1200 mAh gives an unusually long operating time, the phone can quite easily last several days, or even a week, depending on the activity of use.  Previously, we somehow freely focused on the charge sticks, but now smartphones are accustomed to accurate percentage data and this is not enough in this phone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6af/041/8b4/6af0418b47104d0493d773c616930900.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Communications </h4><br>  The phone works only with 2G networks (850/900/1800/1900 MHz), i.e.  The maximum speed of the mobile Internet is EDGE 236.8 kbps.  On the other hand, the lack of 3G saves us battery power, and high-speed Internet is not needed here, the browser is not so convenient to use it all the time.  Two SIM cards are in a call waiting mode.  You can call on any SIM-card.  As soon as the conversation begins on one SIM-card, the second becomes unavailable. <br>  Wi-Fi can also be used for the Internet, b / g standard networks and all encryption protocols are supported.  HotSpot mode is missing. <br>  And of course, Bluetooth, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dfg9o30v39T8%26feature%3Dyoutu.be%26t%3D1m30s">everything gets better when there is Bluetooth</a> .  All necessary protocols for data transmission and headsets are supported. <br>  Camera <br>  The camera module is the simplest.  2 megapixels with fixed focus, resolution of pictures 1600 by 1200 pixels, matrix size 1/5 inches, f / 2.8 aperture.  There are simple settings, in general, nothing special. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9c/c47/1ea/d9cc471ea7680a0df0bafa12b95e2616.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The camera application does not work quickly, pictures can be saved for a few seconds.  The "Self-portrait" mode seemed interesting, turn it on, point the camera at yourself and the phone prompts: to the left or to the right, above or below.  After your face is in the center of the picture, a shot is taken.  Pictures from the gallery can be sent via Bluetooth, E-mail, MMS, Odnoklassniki, VK, FB, Twitter.  You can also shoot videos in terrible quality and a minimum resolution of 176 by 144 pixels. <br><br><h4>  Software part </h4><br>  The phone works on the Series 40 software platform, that is, it is not a smartphone.  Although many who take the device in hand, they first think that there is Android.  It turns out in the world sold 1.5 billion devices on the S40!  Of course, it‚Äôs a pity that this is not Symbian, the price could have increased, although Nokia was selling budget touch Symbian phones for about the same price. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fec/a8f/5d4/feca8f5d45e1d8c70040e106b1decc7f.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/261/dcd/853/261dcd853ec3ecd8f88bd53fa3a0a130.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I see no reason to talk in detail about the program part, briefly tell you about the most interesting. <br>  The system already has WhatsApp Launcher, when launched, which downloads the full version of the program.  Nothing to pay. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77c/693/5df/77c6935df920909aca0d3d27849260ae.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  WhatsApp can be quickly launched through a special button, or assigned to it another application.  The application is not smart, although it may slow down the device itself, the launch of WhatsApp takes a good 8 seconds. <br>  Even if you left the application to view SMS or answer a call, the application will open for a long time as well.  There is some push, i.e.  In the locked state in the standby mode, the phone can vibrate and make a sound that a message has arrived, the screen will light up and a message will appear on it that you can open or exit. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ee/093/6a0/4ee0936a0278fe40c79bd6a6a0d184f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Also in the notification bar icon appears that a new message has arrived. <br>  The messenger works well, messages are delivered correctly, you can receive and send multimedia content, group chats are supported. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c2/cf7/5dc/3c2cf75dc0b1d93af81a71d8deae9ef6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thanks to the developers for making such a cheap device a good client.  For me, you can say this is one of the most basic applications for which the device was taken. <br>  For music there is a built-in player and FM-radio.  If applications seem small, there is a store where you can buy or download free games and programs, but the choice leaves much to be desired.  For some reason, Viber did not want to be installed, I think they will soon add support for the phone and it will work.  Impatient can try java applet and check its work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c1/361/b43/3c1361b4394fab909b7804ab473acd13.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The performance of the entire system cannot be called fast, small delays of a few milliseconds immediately make themselves felt, although it is rather because of the habit that everything flies on the Nexus.  For a regular phone, I find this speed normal.  If you want to sit in the browser, then it is better not to do it.  Wildly uncomfortable, only for urgent needs. <br>  My contacts are stored in Gmail, so my main Android phone synchronizes contacts with Gmail.  Having rummaged in the phone settings, we managed to set up synchronization, and the contacts were successfully filled into the address book.  Synchronization can be configured by time and periodically update contacts. <br><br><h4>  Work with two SIM-cards </h4><br>  Consider working with two SIM-cards.  The first SIM card is mounted under the battery and is referred to in the system as SIM1.  An additional SIM card can be installed ‚Äúon hot‚Äù and the network will work successfully.  As I said, the radio module is one, i.e.  while talking on one SIM card, the second one becomes inaccessible.  While waiting for a call, both SIM cards are available.  The menu has a special section on setting up SIM-cards.  You can set priority SIM cards for certain services.  In particular, if a call is made, then do it only from a certain SIM card or provide a choice.  For example, I have free SMS on one SIM card and in the dispatcher I can indicate that SMS would always be sent only from this SIM card, and the second SIM card would only be for the Internet.  Everything is simple and affordable.  The only thing that didn‚Äôt like it was that you couldn‚Äôt remember in the address book which SIM card to call a certain contact.  Let's say I want to call the cat from the second SIM-card and I don‚Äôt want the phone to constantly ask - ‚ÄúWhat will we call with?‚Äù Remember this for certain contacts. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f8/ae3/633/9f8ae3633725c6180be4a1d21fca0011.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  No wonder I've been waiting since April, when this phone comes out.  Of course, this is one of the nicest budget phones.  Everyone likes its color, design and nice grungy body.  QWERTY- everything is clear.  Also one of the big advantages is a good work with WhatsApp and the presence of 2 SIM-cards, which will help you to stay in touch if the main handset has sat down.  Of the minuses - this is a slight slowdown of the interface and a long launch of WhatsApp.  The phone is convenient to use in conjunction with a small tablet.  With the reception there are no problems, during the conversation you hear a very small echo of your own, it does not cause discomfort. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187086/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187086/</a></p>
