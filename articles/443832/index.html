When we see something imperfect, our consciousness wants to find out what is happening - we become curious.  On the other hand, when something is too irregular or ‚Äúcheesy‚Äù, we ignore it as irrelevant noise. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e22/d5e/87d/e22d5e87d87de9af4d65795e6a0560b9.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  Curiosity is one thing ... but what makes imperfections beautiful? <br><br><h3>  The difference between excellence and skill </h3><br>  You may have read the famous story of Giorgio Vasari about Giotto, an early Renaissance artist.  In this story, Giotto was asked to prove his mastery in painting.  He did this by drawing the perfect circle without using any technical tools other than his brush.  Unfortunately, I did not attend myself, but I suppose that the circle of Giotto was <b>not perfect, but was a workshop</b> .  To explain the difference between them, I'm going to show you how good, or bad, I draw:

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebc/b0c/549/ebcb0c549d1fa2e0bfd9ae99a45d0399.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  As you can see, my drawing is far from perfect.  The red area indicates how much my circle is different from the ideal circle drawn by the software.  This illustrates the <b>tension between goal and achievement</b> .  Mastery is the desire to make this area disappear.  And the red zone at Giotto was probably much smaller than mine. <br><blockquote>  <b>Mastery is not perfection, it is the pursuit of perfection.</b> </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><h3>  One of the things that makes hand drawings exciting is: effort </h3><br>  Sporting events are exciting because of mistakes, blunders, falls, failures ‚Äî and the struggle to avoid them.  The drama of athletes serves as a metaphor for the personal struggle in our lives, the tension between our goals and our actual achievements.  Watching the athlete perform flawlessly is pleasant, but watching him fight is even more exciting. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/714/539/821/7145398219f51bda2e20167628a4dd69.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  Now I suppose that this kind of struggle can be observed in hand-drawn paintings.  What makes them ‚Äúalive‚Äù, ‚Äúcharming‚Äù or ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù is not necessarily the unique ‚Äústyle‚Äù of the author, his personal ‚Äúexpression‚Äù.  This is his struggle for excellence.  Seeing how someone draws can sometimes <b>show this struggle</b> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/135645467" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Artists and designers often hide this process and show only the brilliant results of their efforts.  But in the world of perfect brilliant products, the imperfection of the process can be precisely what makes your work interesting for your audience.  This makes human work (in the best sense of the word) and thus beautiful. <br><blockquote>  <b>We love to see the process, not just the result.</b>  <b>Deficiencies in your work can be great if they show your struggle for excellence, rather than a lack of care.</b> </blockquote><h3>  This is never enough - live with it! </h3><br>  Many creatives know this nagging in their head while they are working on something.  This voice will accurately indicate all shortcomings and mistakes in your work even before its completion.  <a href="http://postcards.ralphammer.de/">Whenever I draw,</a> this voice always - ALWAYS - convinces me that this is the worst thing I've ever done in my life.  Ever  I see the wrong perspective, wrong proportions, curved lines ... all this is very dramatic.  Imagine my relief when I realized that these errors might really please the viewers, because they can participate in my fight!  Following the ideas of Wabi Sabi, I acquired the habit of perceiving these shortcomings, they became part of my work. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b41/8a8/f06/b418a8f0616a1d7088ea42dccc1a3a3d.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  <i>Roofs, Venice, <a href="http://postcards.ralphammer.de/">postcards.ralphammer.de</a></i> <i><br></i> <br>  In our pursuit of mastery, we must learn to live with imperfections, with this contradiction between our goals and what we actually achieve.  Just as we all know, this article could have been written much better.  But this is the best I can do.  Therefore, we must live right here and now. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443832/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443832/</a></p>
