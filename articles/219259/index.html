Together with Pavel Belyaev on the ship "Voskhod 2" they flew to the most terrible and hostile place, where they proved that a person can survive even in such an extreme environment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c2/fbf/137/9c2fbf137511857418dd33713b9ff071.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Alexey Leonov hovers over the world.</i>  <i>As befits a peasant of this level</i> <br><br>  Leonov spent 12 minutes in open space. <br>  Actually, the scientific goal of the experiment was this: see if it survives at all.  At that time, the astronautics did not even know how the spacesuit would behave in space, not to mention the human body. <br>  That is why Leonov‚Äôs spacesuit was so strongly inflated with oxygen that he could not get back into the capsule.  And if he was not going to remain in orbit until the end of his life (that is, about another hour), he needed to do something VERY cool. <br><br>  Leonov judged simply: if oxygen bothers him so, what for he needs it, this oxygen.  He turned the valve from the ‚Äúkeep the air inside‚Äù position to the ‚Äúdon't keep the air inside‚Äù position (which should be the first on the list to <b>never-do-not-do this</b> in cosmonaut school lessons. Just before ‚ÄúDon't sit under the rocket engines‚Äù). <br>  Well, and he thought that he should not disturb the uncles from the control center, so they did not inform them about this. <br><br>  Still, Leonov was able to return to the capsule, but space, it seems, is thoroughly sunk on this tough guy, and did not want to let him go. <br>  In addition to problems with the spacesuit, there were problems with closing the hatch, the brake autopilot refused, the orbital module did not fire and burned in the atmosphere, but they landed hundreds of kilometers from the calculated point, directly into the snowy taiga, full of bears and wolves.  And two more days there stuck out. <br>  Although, in truth, to say the truth, the only thing for which an angry bear could approach Leonov was to ask: what is it like to be such a cool macho. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ca/9a3/7c2/6ca9a37c2afa42905302d9a557671cdf.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Let me open you a beer, comrade Leonov</i> <br><br><h4>  # 4.The cosmonauts will endure. </h4><br>  "World" is one of the most amazing things made by people.  At the time when the first Zelda was just preparing to leave, we had already built a real space station.  ‚ÄúWorld‚Äù for ten years survived the nation that created it, once again proving that space travel is above fucking politics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f5/087/81d/1f508781d8cadb6f9b2422c91a2ece52.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Nope, no sign jokes.</i>  <i>Just look at it until you realize how amazing it is.</i> <br><br>  Unfortunately, the fucking policy gave surrender.  Transport ships had to be docked by hand, because the country that produced docking autopilots was no longer part of Russia.  The first two attempts nearly ended in a catastrophe, but the idiots below still squeezed their heads and said, ‚ÄúGod loves a trinity‚Äù!  It turned out not to love.  And to make sure of this, they turned off the Mira radar systems, and ordered them to dock using hand-held range finders and peeping through the window. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5be/df6/be0/5bedf6be06f43acda41663ffdc7834f6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Remarkably, the milkman has arrived, and two tons of metal are flying straight at me.</i> <br><br>  What followed, billiards is still called the most predictable clash in history.  And shouting "* b your mother!", Remembering how the spacecraft rammed the space station. <br>  Vasily Tsibliev, Alexander Lazutkin, and Mike Fall felt how their ears were laid, and in space it is worse than feeling piranha between their legs, because in this case at least there is enough air for screaming. <br><br>  Chasing with the wind of vacuum death, they had to open upholstery and communications, fastening the station together.  When they still closed the hatch, it turned out that the station was incorrectly oriented, the solar panels did not work, and the emergency batteries worked all the time while the astronauts were trying to keep the remaining air inside.  So, the batteries are almost gone.  And they sat down. <br>  And the station died. <br><br>  30 hours three people rotated around the earth in a useless tin. <br>  They thought, as if not to die and at the same time to reorient the station, using the engines of the "Union".  If we could look at them at that moment, we would see them waving paper.  But not in a dispute, as you might think, but chasing away the exhaled carbon dioxide. <br><br>  And they managed to deploy the station so that the energy from the solar panels was enough to communicate with the Earth.  After 30 hours on the verge of life and death, they were finally able to sleep.  Foul later said: ‚ÄúAfter 48 hours we were able to power the toilet.  And I think it was very important, because by that time we were almost bursting. ‚Äù <br><br>  This is not a joke.  You can not just defend the need for a secluded place in a flying box with electronics.  A mere mortal in such a situation would long ago have cast a spew on everything accumulated, but three brave cosmonauts were held back for two days.  Such are they cool, astronauts. <br><br><h4>  # 3.To give the robot to steer. </h4><br>  Robonavt - just the real embodiment of science fiction, in fact, like everything else in space exploration.  Eternally awake, Robonavt created to serve, and knows how to use the same tools and computing systems that people - masters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/175/467/c87/175467c873ac6f9bf8052fbe3b7a8342.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Cosmos: it's so cool here, even with white afro-style</i> <br><br>  The ISS is much more technological than anywhere else on Earth.  Literally.  Even pranks.  Because, apart from the ISS crew, only the Cylon (Battlestar Galactica) use robots to distract the enemy.  Unpacking the new form of life that arrived, members of the crew Catherine Coleman and Paolo Nespoli opened the cage (sorry, the drawer), and found that it was empty. <br>  (Robonauts are transported with power off, fixed and sealed in a box. Well, at least the guys who are preparing the load for the start are watching a movie) <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/bvaeZkxCodM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhaEMaGNHPiMTMcWNEdvwAJe2mEPQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  After searching the station, Robonaut was found. <br>  He has already joined the management of the Japanese Experimental Module. <br>  (Apparently because ‚Äúrobot‚Äù and ‚ÄúJapanese‚Äù are words that are close in meaning.) <br><br>  Admittedly, the guys play as well as Tree No.3 (behind the other Trees) on the Christmas Play. <br>  However, when someone‚Äôs job is to ‚Äúlaunch rocket boosters‚Äù and ‚Äúmaintain oxygen levels‚Äù, you don‚Äôt expect from them the intonations of a professional comedian.  And of course it's very cool to let the robot take over the station when he could do it anyway. <br><br>  Imagine, suddenly, Robonaut asks, ‚ÄúRaise your arms, who needs oxygen?‚Äù, And then opens the hatch, watching how these miserable bags of bones fly into outer space.  It is quite likely, with such memories of ‚Äúbirth‚Äù: you get out of the bindings, hide from people, take control of the station, and then these little people come and start to mock you. <br>  Therefore, the future inevitable uprising machines - just revenge for a difficult childhood. <br><br><h4>  # 2.Explosion steeper than the action movie </h4><br>  Every cosmonaut is a living paradox.  Indeed, without a doubt, the one who is ready to fly into space on astride explosives has such large eggs that it is difficult to launch them into space.  But while ordinary gods think about this issue, astronauts cope with it. <br><br>  There is another rather paradoxical thing: much more dangerous than sitting on an exploding bomb is trying to escape from it.  Because the Emergency Rescue System violates the Second Rule of the school of astronauts.  It turns out that to escape with a huge rocket under your ass, you need to launch several rockets right above your head. <br>  All of these rockets are connected by explosive bolts (pyrobolts) (because any small part of the spacecraft is steep by definition).  In general, spacecraft is the exact opposite of the action movie: a series of large explosions can make humanity even smarter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae3/a7c/eda/ae3a7cedac90be4b48335bdaaa138a38.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Apollo SAS test.</i>  <i>Pay attention to the special configuration of the "astronaut grill"</i> <br><br>  The overloads created by the CAC are up to 17g.  Vladimir Titov and Gennady Strekalov had to survive this. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/b7bDIRmNDcM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjdQnXwFZEl1V5vu4LpRMaYg5TTDg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  For the first and last time, this system worked during the launch of the Soyuz T-10-1.  Then only one valve failed, and, unfortunately, it was a valve ‚Äúto keep kerosene in a rocket‚Äù.  The rocket and launch pad caught fire.  But even fires are smarter on rockets, so the SAS control cables immediately burned out.  Duplicate the launch could only two engineers, sitting in different rooms 30 kilometers from the start.  And they had just in time. <br><br><h4>  # 1.Jon Aaron beat Zeus. </h4><br>  Apollo 12 is the most amazing thing we have ever done (part 2).  But there was one minute for which the whole mission could fall to hell.  A fairly accurate expression for flight with thousands of tons of fuel and oxygen on board.  Includes even frying sinners in the pan.  So: at one point, all the screens in the MCC "floated", and the alarm panel lit up like a self-destructing Christmas tree. <br><br>  Listen to the astronaut report at 1:21. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/eWQIryll8y8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhirnMnURC6LzAfOQV0zSKq3XsFK0Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It was easier for astronauts to list what works for them. <br>  "Well, we are still fastened, and the chairs do not hang around the ship yet." <br>  And NASA somehow does not like to drop bombs on civilians, and if they could not fix it, Apollo 12 would have to be undermined.  Together with the future of the entire space program.  But Flight Operator John Aaron solved the problem in 59 seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33e/e8f/a41/33ee8fa41812b50190dac776eb6777ac.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>You may wonder why there is not written "the greatest genius of all time."</i>  <i>And here you will understand that this is actually enough.</i> <br><br>  Aaron passed only one command ‚ÄúSwitch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_12">SCE</a> to AUX‚Äù, and if this is some incomprehensible garbage for you, then you now feel the same thing as the flight director, communications man, and the commander of Apollo 12. SCE is an unimportant subsystem and it turned out that in the whole building Aaron alone knew how it worked.  Commander Pete Conrad, in response, quite intelligently inquired: "What kind of garbage is this?"  Fortunately, astronaut Alan Bean knew what kind of garbage.  Well, then you already know everything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df3/ab9/80e/df3ab980e95688d58109baf291ed33f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Later it turned out that lightning struck Saturn V.  Twice.  Yes, the astronauts are so harsh that they did not even notice how they were hit several times in a row by lightning!  The charges passed through the rocket, through the flow of ionized gas from the boosters, and grounded to the launch column.  This is how a huge lightning rod came out during the launch process. <br>  Astronauts flew to the gods on a giant middle finger of metal and plasma, and when Zeus decided to defend, he did not work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/409/32e/9ad/40932e9add97ec0698e29d956ca764d1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Akela missed!</i> <br><br>  John Aaron became a legend.  He was nicknamed "Steely-Eyed Missile Man", <i>which is difficult to translate, and means something like "The coolest man with steel nerves and eggs, who looks to the root, says essentially, and can find original solutions at a critical moment</i> . <i>"</i> <br><br>  And when in a building where every second person launches rockets on the moon, YOU are called the ‚ÄúMissile Man‚Äù, i.e.  roughly - a rocket, then God modestly collects his little things so that you can take his throne and rule the skies. <br><br>  [ <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-5-most-badass-things-ever-done-in-space/">Original</a> ] </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/219259/">https://habr.com/ru/post/219259/</a></p>
