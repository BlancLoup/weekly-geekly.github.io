      <br>
      It all started with the fact that in my childhood I considered myself a very stupid child (partly, of course, soundly), despite the fact that I studied quite well at school and ended up with a silver medal, but I was always ashamed of it because believed that he received it unfairly. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yes, I really spent almost all my time studying, except for the time when I was just physically unable to because I had exhausted my capabilities (well, of course, laziness), but mastering the work of the transistor, which I combined with studying the work of electronic tubes, mastering derivatives, it took me years.  Really years.  Of course, I do not say that I sat every day on different books in which it was possible to study a specific problem from different sides.  I studied the problems of just one first available book and tried to conduct a lot of thought experiments, for which I simply lacked my intellect.  I felt his shortage very keenly.  And when my eyes turned to the world that surrounds me, how people behave, how they plan and realize their lives, how states function, everything that happens around me, I was sure that I do not understand why everything is happening this way for one reason, I am too stupid to understand it.  But time passed.  I entered the institute and began to notice that very often what had previously seemed too complicated due to my genius in events was simply the result of someone‚Äôs unbearable stupidity.  And when, in my perception, I became increasingly convinced that people who make important decisions simply do not deserve to be in their places, then everything began to fall into place.  I realized that idiots too much.  Moreover, idiocy is a very real, highly virulent disease that people easily infect. <br><br>  The realization of this led me into a wild depression.  The more I understood, the less I wanted to live in this world.  I just became aware that I, by definition, could not be happy in him.  It has too much dirt, too much aggression, too much lies and too much cruelty, and all this is ensured by the general stupidity that skillfully mimics rationality.  Coupled with personal problems, this led me to thoughts of suicide, from which I made, I think, a very reasonable conclusion: ‚ÄúYes, I am ready to die, but not throwing myself out of the window, or in some other idiotic way.  I want to die of overload as a result of trying to change this world. ‚Äù  I believe that this is an ideal formula for suicide, because if I die, I will not lose anything, but on the contrary, I will get those fabulous moments that occur in the life of anyone, even the most unlucky person.  But besides, there is always a small chance that I will still be able to change this world, and I will become a truly happy person!  And I began my suicide by giving up a formal education (institute), which I had by then completely ceased to respect, and went to serve in the special forces of the GRU, from where I could not escape from my weakness ‚Äî I simply would not be allowed to do this ... It was not easy, but it was there that I got what I lacked most of all - strength, which I never had, and I always missed it very much. <br><br>  Since childhood I have been a positive person.  In the fights almost did not participate.  I was not just afraid to fight, I was afraid of conflicts.  It always seemed to me that conflicts are a thing that is absolutely superfluous in human relations.  Well, indeed, why conflict, if you can calmly discuss the problem and, making concessions to each other, solve it. <br><br>  Of course, I was a naive idiot, but why was ... I still think so now, but with only one reservation - there are those people with whom it works (and there are very few of them), but there are those with whom conflict is the only possible solution. .  This I best realized in the army.  And it was there that the thought came that some people need to be isolated from each other.  Isolating is not on religious grounds, not by gender, not by nationality.  Isolate from each other by psycho, and only in this case, the wise and reasonable will become even better, and the stupid ... and with the stupid, nothing terrible will happen. <br><br>  In fact, I had the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsomething similar before the army.  In my head was a project that I called "Atlantis-7".  Who was supposed to represent an Internet portal where the most talented could exchange experience, tell which sources of information are the most digestible and truthful, teach each other, and just meet, communicate, and love each other. <br><br>  This project, of course, by its definition did not include stupid people.  He simply ignored them and this is, as I now believe, a significant mistake.  First of all, because smart people always turn out to be stupid.  Well, stupid people can not be ignored, because they are everywhere.  You may get a stupid doctor who will cripple you with his treatment or kill you.  Dumb driver, who believes that you can go to the red, if you hurry and knock down someone from loved ones.  And the worst thing is that all this is not just pessimistic calculations, but these are facts.  Today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow there will be victims of stupidity.  In general, I consider stupidity the most terrible human disease, from which more people died than from any other, including old age, because the root cause of most diseases, catastrophes, wars is human stupidity, resulting at a particular moment in the inability to predict the consequences of an act (or, worse, awareness of the possible consequences, and internal agreement with this), as well as the inability to find another, more reasonable solution, and thus leading to tragedies. <br><br>  Here I would like to note that stupidity is an aggressive form of stupidity, and stupidity is inherent in every person.  Every person in life has done stupid things and therefore every person has the right to be stupid.  Then how to separate the stupid from the stupid?  It's very simple: a stupid one realizes his own stupidity and is ready to trust in solving complex tasks, the solution of which he does not know, to more experienced and rational people, while stupid will always consider themselves better and smarter than everyone else.  A smart person will always consider himself stupid, because he understands how complex and diverse the world is and he will never achieve perfection, and will always listen to someone else‚Äôs opinion, even if it‚Äôs a stupid person‚Äôs opinion, because even the most stupid can say something very reasonable, and sometimes something stupid, but that makes sense, which can serve as a starting point for a sensible idea.  In fact, this separation has no practical significance, but only a purely theoretical one.  It is important to understand only one thing - it is necessary that stupid people not suffer from the isolation of stupid ones. <br><br>  <i>Thus, if we want to build an ideal society, the first thing to do is to raise the banner of "Intelligent people, unite!"</i> <br><br>  This is the basic part of the neocommunism formula, but the cry alone will not suffice.  Here it is necessary to go to the very name - neo-communism.  I use it precisely because in history there has already been a relatively successful experiment in creating an ideal society.  An experiment on us.  And it so happened that I, being born in the USSR, seized a small island of communism (more precisely socialism), which was slowly dying away in the rays of capitalism.  I, in my favorite urban-type settlement, faced only its positive sides, namely: <br>  1) comfort.  Yes, this is probably the most important thing that I felt there.  Home coziness of a village equipped for itself, in which there were always freshly painted flowerbeds, equipped fences, fencing around the front gardens with flowers, a fountain, a club, on the asphalt ground in front of which various holidays were held ... - the fading traces of the once-prosperous Soviet mining village.  A pair of sovdepovskih stores, where you could buy the most delicious bread I have ever eaten, the most delicious eclairs and the most real ice cream, are products, after which ‚Äúusual‚Äù for me, ‚Äúcapitalist‚Äù, if you can put it that way, store things were perceived as something mild or salty, with a taste of some kind of chemistry.  Yes, indeed, the choice of products was extremely scarce, but these were truly high-quality, fresh products, and I very keenly felt that difference; <br>  2) people.  I am always amazed at the expression ‚ÄúSoviet-style man‚Äù.  How accurate is the definition.  In my mind, people from the Soviet past are people from hardened steel.  And I always felt this by their words, which they never threw to the wind, and of course by their actions.  For me, always the symbols of the Soviet people will be those sculptures of the Soviet time, in which they were simply carved out of stone, or forged from steel with these remains of angularity or scale.  What is this magical feeling when you realize that you can rely on a person, not a bit doubting him, when it does not even occur to you that someone or someone you hurt can be hurt because you see people around you which is warm in the eyes.  Warmly and simply indestructible strength, obtained as a result of hard work.  At that time I did not understand what a rare quality this was ... and it was with me that they left the life, and in their place came people of a new wave, not bad, but how far are they in their spiritual development from those whom I now consider the benchmark sincerity and kindness, mixed up on the incredible strength of the spirit. <br><br>  I would like to revive all the best that was in the Soviet Union, and there was a lot of the best there: <br>  1) a culture that fostered the spirit, mutual assistance, ingenuity, in which there was no hatred and anger, there was no fear; <br>  2) science, which to this day, in my opinion is the benchmark.  Those who read Soviet textbooks, I am sure, immediately fall in love with the presentation of the material, which, as a rule, is chewed up very well and it is always clear that the book was written by a real expert in this matter.  An expert who understands that clarifies the material to the beginner and therefore uses simple speech, chewing on complex words; <br>  3) standards that have enveloped all areas of industrial activity.  In particular, thanks to the standards, the high quality of all manufactured products was ensured; <br>  4) ideology, which for some reason usually cursed.  Yes, I do not approve of the glorification of the leader, I do not approve of too harsh censorship, but for those cultural remnants that have come down to us, the ideology was primarily to educate worthy citizens who could not only peacefully but also coexist, work hard and get pleasure from your business.  I am sure that a person is not able to live in the absence of ideology, where the absence of ideology is declared, in fact it is, it is simply not centralized and is shaped by the most information and influential circles, which, as a rule, large companies become.  In the absence of ideology, in fact, informational passages from advertisements, films, videos, radio programs become the guideline to which a person (mainly children) will pay attention, and the person works like this, that the first part of his life he chooses ideals from those available to him at this moment and in many ways copies them. <br><br>  I have been interested in the question for a very long time already: ‚ÄúHow did the Soviet Union turn into Russia in the 1990s?‚Äù  There are various conspiracy theories that I think have the right to life, there are economic rationales, but for me personally all this does not matter.  I want to understand how the Soviet people, among whom there was cruel, were punished not that thieves, and even such harmless by today's standards as the unemployed, under the article for parasitism (even Viktor Tsoi had to work as a fireman), people who were always very sympathetic , turned into those who do not care at all but themselves.  And in my thoughts and observations I came to this opinion: ‚ÄúThe ideology of capitalism, or rather the lack of its own ideology, was to blame for everything.‚Äù <br><br><h4>  What is bad capitalism? </h4><br>  Honestly, since childhood I have believed that capitalism is the ideal form of government and that was a very remarkable example - the United States, ideal in all senses.  The high standard of living of all segments of the population, people are happy with their lives and the rest of the world envies them.  I was also jealous and wanted to go there to live, when I could see that Russia is a country of victorious corruption, criminals, drunkards - all this was strongly felt in the 90s.  Since childhood, I have not accepted the fact that all people can be equated.  Talented people should not receive as many benefits as those who do everything carelessly as it was in the Soviet Union.  I have always been sure that competition, which ideally should lead to the fact that talented people can open their businesses, organize business, compete in their business with other organizers, should lead to the improvement of the world as a whole.  After all, according to the logic of capitalism, the most talented should survive, i.e.  whoever does business for people, i.e.  creates the best quality products, provides the best quality services and all this at the best prices.  So it should have been.  But it turned out that competition may be completely different.  And now it is too clearly seen that this ‚Äúother‚Äù competition is becoming decisive at the present time.  What are its basic principles? <br><br><h4>  Competition is evil </h4><br>  Competition may be different.  In sports, the competition is that the most prepared wins.  That is how it should be.  But there are those who begin to cheat - dope, various tricks to lower the morale of the opponent, etc.  So now I see capitalism.  In the world, life hackers are beginning to play an increasing role every year, finding holes in the not-so-slim idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcapitalism, i.e.  those people who clearly noticed that in order to defeat a competitor it is not necessary to be better than him.  Quite the contrary - you need to be mercantile, insidious and preferably a killer.  The need for mercantile spirituality and deceit is manifested in the fact that if you use the cheapest components and technologies in production, and present it as some kind of innovation, and clog the information channels with false advertising, you can get much more benefit than if you do everything honest, because with all this everything will be according to the law.  I mentioned that it is necessary to be a murderer not only and not so much because it is possible to squeeze business from others in this way, but because sometimes for a business the most optimal from the point of view of profit is the indirect destruction of people.  The growth of tobacco, alcohol companies, artificially high prices for medicines, the promotion of asocial behavior, to promote certain goods, services, "works of art" - all this is clearly visible now.  The most interesting thing is that the world society itself has not changed much in terms of understanding life ideals and values, but it is increasingly beginning to consume what contradicts them for one very weighty reason - a lie.  Lying has become the most important tool for business promotion, as well as for policy promotion.  The main reason for such a course of affairs is the lack of control over the lie on the part of the state, as it was in the Soviet Union, and the absence of any significant mechanisms of control by the society.  Those.  Of course, some control tools are still there, but they are scattered and do not stop the lie, which in turn becomes harder to recognize and, more importantly, it becomes harder to catch, because  improved mechanisms of lies. <br><br><h4>  Lie Shielding Mechanisms </h4><br>  The most widely used methods of masking lies, such as: <br>  1) understatement, i.e.  a logical chain of truthful informational messages leads to a false conclusion, although this conclusion in the message itself is missing, and therefore there is no formal pretext for the proceedings.  In this case, the message contains only those truthful messages that give it the necessary semantic coloring, while contradictory truthful messages are silent; <br>  2) blurring of meaning, i.e.  There is a double meaning in the message chain - an obvious meaning necessary for the audience, which is the main goal of the chain and not an obvious one that is necessary for a formal justification; <br>  3) attracting reputable people to promote goods and services.  This becomes possible, because for the appropriate authority involved, in most cases only the amount of remuneration is important.  The authority in the news report, of course, clearly never indicates the shortcomings of what it advertises, with the result that these shortcomings seem to be insignificant or absent altogether. <br><br><h4>  Existing capitalism leads to dystopia </h4><br>  Under existing conditions, the richest companies are those who lie better than anyone, i.e.  those who can sell cheap goods or services for expensive, paying as little as possible to their employees and the state. ,       ,        ,  ,  ,   .         ,  ,     . ,   ,     ,     ,        ,   , ‚Äî .     ‚Äî        ,         ,         .   ,           .        ,     ,         ,            .          .     ,      ,        ,       ¬´ 25¬ª. <br><br><h4> ,  ,  </h4><br>                       (    ) (   ,    , ‚Äî      ¬´ ¬ª,      ,          ),    ,    ,       ‚Ä¶    ,      ‚Äî . ,    ,    ,   ,            ,     ,    ,   , , ,     ,     (     )      ,    .   ,       ,    ,   ,  ,        . <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How is it possible to educate yourself to become the leader of something big and bright? And how can you create a society that consists entirely of such worthy people? I voiced the answer at the very beginning - to unite. Unite under the auspices of personal growth, self-improvement. But here we come to the problem that we live in the real world, where we want to eat, live somewhere, help our loved ones and, if we are lucky, also enjoy life. It turns out that it is necessary to add to this society the functionality of making money - the generally accepted equivalent of our earthly blessings. But perhaps this is contrary to the original goal - self-development? No, just the opposite. Just imagine what kind of things a crowd of intellectuals can do, provided they read the fable about the swan, cancer and pike. Even a few smart peopleunited by a common concept, as I am sure, can move mountains. All that is needed for this is to provide them with the exchange of information and the creation of such workplaces where they can work effectively increasing each other‚Äôs achievements. And besides making money, it will also be the easiest and most reliable way to self-development, of course, if it is making money will be associated with intellectual or artistic activities.Of course, if this making money will be associated with intellectual or artistic activities.Of course, if this making money will be associated with intellectual or artistic activities.</font></font><br><br>        ?    ,     ,      ,        , , ,       ,      ,       ,    .  ,  ,    , ,    ,               .          . ,  ,     ,      .              , ..     ,    ,     ,        -  .        ? ,  -      ,     ,  -,               .     ,     ,     ( )        ,  .        ,        ,       .      ,   ,   ,  ,      ,          ,       - ,     ,     - ,   -  ,    ,    ,   ,   ,   .         ,     , .. ,      ,        .   ,       .       ,     (   -   ), ,     ,    .       ,       , ..  ,   ,           (      ), ‚Äî         .       .                 , ,      3D-         ¬´ ¬ª.                 ,    ,     ,         ‚Äî . <br><br>  ,        ,        -   , ..       , , ,     ,     . <br><br>      () ,           ,        ,     , , , .. ,       , ‚Äî      ,      . <br><br>       ,      3D-, ,          ,       .           ,  ,  ,          . <br><br><h4>   </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Depending on the number of users of the system, it may be possible to create its own political force that will advance the interests of the community within the state (or even the states).

In addition, such a political force can bring order to the political system of the state and smoothly grow together with the state apparatus.</font></font><br><br><h4>  Mutual aid </h4><br>             ,       .   ,   ,      ,       -,      ,    (      )  , ‚Äî      , ‚Äî    , ,       .

It is completely built on the platform of capitalism, i.e. does not require any revolutions. He does not require that all society be part of it. Neocommunism is just a social network, arranged according to its own rules and having real manifestations in life, in the form of LLC, political forces and production areas. Those who will not use the system will not lose anything regarding their current situation, while those who will use it will simply acquire additional opportunities. This form is convenient because it allows you to exclude a user from the system for its inhuman behavior (murder, violence, theft).A person excluded from the system will only lose additional opportunities, but at the same time will be able to use the public (informational) part of the system, but will not be able to take part in it. Here the important point is the problem of the yoke. By law, a person who has served a prison sentence in prison is considered to have redeemed his guilt and I personally do not deny it. However, I believe that information on the criminal record of a person should be publicly available (the article, the circumstances of the case, which sometimes change the attitude even to the killer, for example, who killed the abuser of his child). So a person who has served for pedophilia (or who has healed in a psychiatric hospital) should be ‚Äúon a pencil‚Äù, i.e. he should not be allowed to even come close to children, despite the fact that the law allows it, as well as people who have been in prison should not fall into power.At the very least, the information on the prison should be publicly available.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Why is a sect good? </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the minds of most people it is clearly stated that a sect is a community created for the purpose of brainwashing, weaning apartments and the destruction of the person in general. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And this is not surprising - there are a lot of examples of this, but why do people even go to sects? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Did they all want to part with real estate, lose their identity?</font></font> Not.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And we come to sugar, which people are lured into sects, and sugar is a sense of collectivity, mutual support, even if it is fake. And what if you create a "sect" in which there are no attempts to withdraw money, there is no brainwashing with mythical ideas. What if you create a community in which there will be just those people who are willing to support each other? I am sure that such a community will not be able to exist without an ideology that will draw in new ‚Äúadepts‚Äù. But what if this ideology is the most ordinary, classical morality, and the quality of the reference books will be all world literature with a classical interpretation of morality? After all, it will be an ideal ‚Äúsect‚Äù in which, on the one hand, there will be meetings with mutual psychological support, communication, joint work and rest, and on the other hand, it will not have all the negative sides,for which do not like the sect. So we come to the generally accessible social manifestation of neocommunism, small or large associations of people in which everyone knows everything about the other members and thus eliminates the possibility of ‚Äúrandom‚Äù people who could spoil the aura of mutual support and mutual support.</font></font><br><br><h4>  ‚Äî   </h4><br> ,     ,    ,      ,        .    , ‚Äî  ,     ,    ,       (), ()   , ‚Äî   . ,       . <br><br><h4>  Research </h4><br>  If at one point to collect a huge number of people, information from which with a high degree of probability can be considered reliable, then this opens up tremendous opportunities for research and experimentation.  So it would be great if the townsfolk could share their successful stories on how to cure various diseases, and professionals put forward hypotheses about the causes of the cure and carried out relevant research (including in the framework of professional laboratories).  In this way, it would be possible to identify ideal treatment regimens for specific diseases, for people with different characteristics, i.e.  it is also necessary to reveal what could be the peculiarities of the course of the disease in different people and how to predict them, to put forward tips for the prevention of diseases, which I consider to be even more significant.  In general, I am categorically opposed to the statement that self-treatment is bad.  The reason is still the same stupidity (and sometimes just not enough education or material interest in promoting a specific medicine or treatment device or something else), which does not bypass many doctors.  At least, I came across this more than once and came to a simple conclusion: any illness can be dealt with, especially when you are vitally interested in this and this interest will likely make you smarter than your doctor.  I would like to give specific examples.  I was sick a lot in childhood and I always wondered why there is no single, effective treatment regimen for colds.  Yes, it is clear that everyone has a different organism, but almost all bacteria are the same.  This is me saying that if there were an effective and safe bactericidal remedy, you could quickly treat a cold.  At the very least, it would be great if each medicine would have open information about in vitro and in vivo studies, in which it would be clear which bacteria affect the effectiveness of a particular drug.  And of course, it is desirable that these studies be conducted on ordinary people who live real life, and not sit in their sterile boxes, and besides, those who did not pay for this research, but on the contrary, they paid with their health, and so would be interested in telling the truth.  As a result of reflection and a small study, it became clear that there is a small set of universal, relatively safe antiseptics that destroy the widest possible range of microbes: Miramistin, chlorhexidine and hydrogen peroxide.  According to the description, chlorhexidine is the most aggressive, only for external use, while, as for miramistina, ingestion is permissible.  I tried to treat Miramistin for a cold - the effect was zero and I began to look for information about whether it is permissible for such a simple and understandable substance as hydrogen peroxide to enter the body.  What consequences can this lead to?  Considering its formula, which is very close to the formula of water, I considered that it is a rather safe substance (reaction products cannot be heavy metals or something poisonous), but with acidic properties.  I found information on the Internet about the fact that even someone drinks it.  This was enough for me to have a strongly diluted solution (I could be wrong, but I think about 1.0%) to try to drip my nose for the treatment of rhinitis (then forgive me for the details of blowing my nose).  And I was very surprised by the effect - a runny nose passed almost instantly.  Of course, I still don‚Äôt know how safe it is and whether it can lead to any problems, but as a goal for a multiple experiment among volunteers, I think this experiment would be interesting if the risks were preliminary estimated by professionals. <br><br>  In addition, personally, I am greatly annoyed by the dominance of generics at inflated prices.  It's one thing if generics are more effective for some reason than prototype drugs, and then it needs experimental research and justification, and quite another when pushing them to the market with aggressive advertising and blocking much cheaper drugs prototypes (usually it happens automatically from the pharmacy chains, which receive a fixed percentage of sales, which means they do not benefit from cheap drugs).  Just as often you can find a placebo at the price of the elixir of youth, which brings profit to its manufacturer only through false advertising. <br><br>  Also annoying medical paradoxes.  Sometimes just disgusting in their idiocy.  Here I would like to recall the treatment of hepatitis C, which is still often carried out with the help of outdated super-expensive drugs with a huge number of hard side effects, and even not guaranteeing a complete cure (they are, of course, advised by the relevant doctors), while judging by the forums ( This, of course, also needs confirmation. A highly effective safe medicine, sofosbuvir, has been released.  Moreover, his generic can be bought in India or China by saving a few more hundred thousand rubles (there are much less patent fees for this medicine because of epidemics), but no doctor will most likely say this.  In other words, it is officially treated for hepatitis C in Russia and is expensive and life-threatening. <br><br>  I personally would also be interested in what substances and how they affect bacteria, viruses and fungi.  And I am talking not only about medical preparations, but also about medicinal herbs and some household substances: salt, vinegar, juices, Coca-Cola (due to the content of orthophosphoric acid, I think it can have a similar effect), etc.  about physical effects (cold, heat, ultraviolet, infrared light). <br><br>  Research, of course, may apply to other areas of life.  For example, the study of ordinary consumer goods is necessary.  Now there is a very good universal product research system, Yandex.Market, which is very good at coping with this task, having on board not only a review system, but also a review system, as well as a discussion of goods.  However, I think this approach is not complete, because it does not include information on product improvements, and information on ideal combinations of products, in addition, the universal rating is used in the review system, while separate assessment of individual qualities of goods.  So an example of product improvement is installing Linux instead of Windows on a laptop or tablet, which is not always a trivial task that professionals could write more or indicate that a full transition to Linux is not possible at the moment due to the lack of some drivers or signed bootloaders .  An example of a combination of products could be the Arduino module with a specific Blutooth extension, for which you can immediately upload a firmware listing.  As for voting on the quality of goods, in the voting system on the camera of the phones one could add a couple (or more) of the pictures taken by the corresponding device in the dark and in the light and carry out voting on the photo, or even connect an automatic program analyzer of the quality of the graphics, which evaluates -or signs (assessment of the real resolution of the photo (or vice versa, blurriness), assessment of colors, etc.). <br><br><h4>  Direct purchase </h4><br>  At the moment, there is no collective procurement mechanism, which would solve many problems.  So, for example, very often farms, producing high-quality goods at low prices, cannot get through to the buyer due to a number of restrictions - on the one hand, their goods are not advertised, but rather their advertising is pressed by larger TNCs, on the other hand, in order to get into trade networks, you need to pay considerable money, which is very often not affordable for small farms.  If you introduce a map of farms and industries, which would be an assessment of the products of each farm, and even better, the results of the inspection of these farms with photos and videos, as well as information on laboratory tests of goods, as well as provide for the possibility of collective procurement, i.e.  funds are collected for the purchase, and a packer is hired for them, who distributes the goods to the final customers in accordance with their orders, and of course, the goods are paid for in production and the delivery is paid.  The goods themselves can be picked up at unloading points (equipped or not equipped), or in stores that agree to such cooperation.  This approach will allow the end customers to get fresh goods at the lowest price, and a quality manufacturer to find customers for their goods without advertising costs and without intermediaries.  Such a mechanism can be a catalyst for the development of high-quality small businesses, especially in the production sector. <br><br><h4>  Fundamentally new technological level </h4><br>  Creating a neo-communist network, and in fact this is a regular social network with additional ‚Äúbody kits‚Äù, in my opinion, will allow humanity to enter the era of technological singularity, subject to certain conditions.  Yes, I believe that the technological singularity is not connected with the creation of artificial intelligence, the appearance of which I personally consider very dangerous and not necessary, but with the appearance of swarm intelligence from people.  To create swarm intellect, the necessary technical base already exists, it is just necessary to work out the theoretical process of the swarm thinking process and create software for this purpose.  In my opinion there are several necessary conditions for its creation: <br>  1) the understanding of all the participants of the swarm thinking of its basic principles, which will be formed mainly empirically during the coordination of the team of swarm intelligence, as a result of which the scientific base of swarm intelligence will be formed; <br>  2) the participation of neural networks in the process of thinking (computing).  Each participant must have direct and quick access to the formation and miscalculation of the neural network.  For this, it is necessary to form a certain set of commands for managing neural networks; <br>  3) the use of neural interfaces will significantly increase the performance of swarm intelligence. <br><br>  In addition to creating swarm intelligence, the technological leap will also be provided by the unlimited scalability of any kind of activity.  This will allow to design and build not only cars and robots, but also entire cities.  Only under the conditions of neocommunism is it possible to create gigaprojects, such as building a sector of the Dyson sphere or (and) terraforming the planets.  No state can afford such projects, especially in a market economy.  They just do not have enough money all over the world.  At that time, if you mobilize intellectuals from all over the planet, you could accomplish what you can only fantasize about in our time (provided that all these intellectuals are provided with everything necessary for a quality life).  For example, the terraforming of Venus by lowering its temperature to acceptable values ‚Äã‚Äãnecessary for the life of bacteria that convert carbon dioxide into oxygen (or for the operation of robots that will do the same).  To do this, it is enough to build a sector of the Dyson sphere, casting a shadow on Venus.  The material for the creation of the Dyson sector (silicon or, in the long run, silicon carbide and aluminum) could be taken from Mercury, for mastering which you also need to solve non-trivial tasks, but for this, of course, you first need to develop electric motors for rockets (which something like a more productive ion engine).  After the terraforming of Venus, we get a high-tech twin of Earth, but without water, which could be collected by capturing hydrogen from the solar wind in traps, which can also be immediately installed on the Dyson sphere.  Also, after completing the construction of the sector of the Dyson sphere, it will be necessary at first to direct a significant part of its energy to accelerate the rotation of the planet around its axis in order to bring the period up to 24 hours and thereby create the necessary magnetic field protecting from the ionizing radiation of the Sun.  The same role should be performed by traps in the sector of the Dyson sphere.  Perhaps it will seem to someone that this all looks like a silly fantasy, but really it can only be solved by swarm intelligence, because of the complexity of the idea, which will find flaws in the idea and correct them, or prove that the idea is completely inconsistent.  Why does neo-communism do it?  Yes, everything is simple - in neo-communism there is (or rather, it should be - new ideas of neo-communism will be added as a result of self-regulation) everything necessary for the geometric growth of the technical and technological base, as well as a high-quality human resource. <br><br><h4>  Neocommunism is inevitable </h4><br>  The ideas that I have outlined, it seems to me, are simple, useful, and easy to implement.  To implement them, it is not necessary to go through wars or riots, it is not required to build separate isolated cities (although this possibility, of course, is not excluded).  They are created in order to create a society in which everyone will not just live comfortably, but he will feel truly happy without any artificial stimulants such as drugs, alcohol and other rubbish.  They go well with human needs.  In view of the foregoing, I believe that neo-communism is inevitable, that is,  small groups (communes) will start to appear in the very near future, especially if you consider that these communes will have phenomenal ‚Äúpower‚Äù, because more often they will consist only of talented people, which means they will attract, like a magnet, everything new and Thus, in this way, I believe that everything is implemented in this idea, in order to create the strongest possible feedback, which on the one hand will enhance the intelligence of the communes, and on the other, attract new people and lead to mergers of the communes.  One thing to remember is that neocommunism absorbed many of the features of communism, so you should not forget that this structure is very similar in characteristics to diamond, it is monstrously solid and can change the outlines of the star system, but just like a diamond burns in fire, so does communism self-destruct immediately, as the number of idiots, traitors, or simply disgusting personalities in its control system passes for a critical one, of course, I retell the history of the USSR.  As for neocommunism, the community itself will be its control system.  All entirely.  So, for the destruction of neocommunism, the degradation of the whole community is needed, which is rather difficult to do, especially if this community will promptly detect factors directly or indirectly affecting it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373253/</a></p>
