Well, everything is simple, there are young people who do not have enough female communication.  Well, or which, in their opinion, deprived of female attention.  For reasons of some kind of complexes, shyness or lack of confidence in oneself can, one way or another, they are not satisfied with this state of affairs and they go to such picker groups.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Is it good or bad? </h1>  When I have a toothache, I go to the dentist.  Usually this is a proven dentist whose professionalism I am confident of.  If I suddenly will be in a strange city and my tooth aches, even without knowing the dentist who will treat me.  I will go to the clinic anyway.  I will not ask someone to pull out my tooth, I will not go to the group for the induction of teeth.  For one reason only, I must be confident in the professionalism of these people. <br>  This I mean, I don‚Äôt really have anything against pickup companies.  Even if you do not discard the moral aspect of this phenomenon.  But before you go to a similar company, you need to simply consider whether they have professional skills.  It is not enough to be able to ‚Äúseduce‚Äù girls.  The person who is going to teach this to others, must be able to teach, must know at least the basic level of psychology.  After all, he can easily only worsen the situation.  for example, if his program is not suitable for a particular person, then he will become even more mired in his complexes, his own insecurity. <br><br><h1>  A game </h1>  The pickup was originally thought of as a game.  They were like-minded people who united in small groups that had a common interest, learn how to communicate with women, develop technologies that make it possible to achieve its location in the shortest possible time.  There was no popularity, there was no mass, there were small discussions on the network.  They found some methods, read books on psychology, studied methods of hypnosis.  They were in a rush.  Because nothing compares to the pioneer.  Arriving in America for the first time you will never feel what Columbus felt.  And sometimes achieving something on your own brings greater pleasure than using the experience of others. <br><br><h1>  Commerce </h1>  But the game turned into a profitable business.  Since it gained widespread popularity.  A pickup from a hobby for some people has completely evolved into a business.  Advertising this product allowed to sell it.  That started to do, a lot of books, websites, firms engaged in training.  Templates, approaches, technologies are being hammered into their heads, they break the world perception.  I am not against other people's experience, but it should be taken as an experience, and not as a dogma.  Moreover, what used to be effective with time becomes banal because it is used too often. <br><br><h1>  As an option </h1><br>  Maybe before you hammer your brains with all sorts of patterns, terminology and "super" techniques, try it yourself?  It's okay if you don't succeed at the beginning, but by drawing conclusions from your mistakes, you can get YOUR experience, which is a hundred times better than someone else's.  Maybe you will create your own style of communication, open up in yourself those skills that you have never imagined.  At least mastering communication skills on your own.  You will be able to understand from what test you are made and what you can do. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29482/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29482/</a></p>
