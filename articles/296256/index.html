  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How do web studios and agencies earn in partnership with online services?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e9b/66e/88b/e9b66e88bdacaae2b82c6c5af6dc590c.png" alt="image"><br>  How can a web-studio or an advertising agency earn in addition to creating and promoting websites?  What types of affiliate programs for web studios exist today and what is their scheme?  For specific examples, we consider some types of partnership offers from Internet services, enabling web developers to replenish their services and gain additional (and perhaps even basic) revenue. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Web Hosting Affiliate Programs </h2><br>  The first thing any developer should think about is to establish close contacts with one of the hosting sites.  The range of affiliate programs offered by hosters is quite wide: from bonuses that you receive from new customers who have come through the referral link to interest on each transfer for hosting. <br>  In the simplest case, you yourself pay for hosting services much less, if you don‚Äôt even host your own website for free.  If you regularly bring to the hoster new clients and its revenue due to you exceeds a certain amount - you get interest from each transaction.  There are a lot of options, and you can choose the most suitable one. <br><br>  As a rule, the host is chosen based on the technical requirements of the site, reputation, technical support capabilities, and so on. The most interesting partner programs for web studios today are associated with the use of virtualization and cloud services.  For example, <a href="http://infobox.ru/partners/"><b>Infobox</b></a> in exchange for the listed clients of virtual hosting, VPS, IaaS platform, Virtual Secretary service offers not only payments from 10 to 30% from each payment, but also free use of VPS and the cloud platform for hosting the agency‚Äôs website as well as and for development.  In addition, there are separate programs for webmasters and IT-integrators.

    <h2>  Web development, design and CMS </h2><br>  Another well-known area that allows web studios not only to quickly and simply solve their own problems, but also to earn extra money on this.  It is cheap to buy and adapt a ready-made site template to a customer‚Äôs needs, create a website based on a convenient template engine, get a partner‚Äôs percentage of a CMS purchased by a developer ‚Äî all of these are well-known ways to generate additional profit. <br><br>  Perhaps the richest range of proposals of this kind can be found in <a href="http://partners.1c-bitrix.ru/program/partner_types.php"><b>1C-Bitrix</b></a> , one of the most popular commercial Russian content management systems.  CMS sublicensing for customers with a big discount (up to 40%), participation in the service of requests for website development, the ability to sell custom modules, templates and entire websites created for 1C-Bitrix are just a partial list of the sources of additional income offered to developers. <br><br>  A more promising area is the development of serious projects based on specific platforms designed for e-commerce and providing for virtually everything that a client may require.  One of these platforms is <a href="http://www.insales.ru/freelancer"><b>InSales</b></a> : the service offers two main types of affiliate programs - referral and reseller.  The referral program allows you to receive a percentage of the deductions from your clients (25-40%).  Under the reseller program, you get a serious discount for using the platform (the basic discount at the time of this writing is 25%). <br><br><h2>  CRM and project management systems </h2><br>  It is hard to imagine modern Internet marketing and e-commerce without the use of customer relationship management systems, newsletters and other online business tools.  Can you handle this task?  If you develop websites on one of the ready-made CMS, then there is a chance that there are ready-made modules for them that you can use.  But most often their functionality is very limited, and rarely suits customers.  Which means - you need to integrate more advanced solutions.  Why not get extra profit from the developers of these solutions? <br><br>  <a href="https://www.bitrix24.ru/partners/"><b>Bitrix24</b></a> offers two options for partners.  Affiliate program includes direct sales service Bitrix24, purchased with an affiliate discount.  Under the affiliate program, you not only get a discount of up to 50% depending on the product version, but also the opportunity to offer discounts to your customers up to 15%. Under the terms of the affiliate program, you get a percentage of sales made on your recommendation (from 20 to 50% from each sales).  Profitable?  Of course.  And the demand for such services will only grow over time, even in the regions. <br><br><h2>  Conversion Upgrade Services </h2><br>  Who needs another non-selling site?  The times when the client did not think about profits in advance were long past: the customers of the websites start counting traffic and planning to convert it into hard cash long before placing an order.  What can we say about the clients of studios specializing in the promotion and lead generation?  Can an internet marketing agency or a developer who continues to administer a client‚Äôs website solve this problem?  Today, yes. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.userpoint.ru/webstudio"><b>UserPoint</b></a> (service of video testing of the site by real users) offers web studios to become regional partners for the joint provision of complex services: website analysis and increasing turnkey conversion. <br>  The conditions are simple: you post on your site information about new services and offer them to your customers.  In turn, UserPoint places your company in its catalog of regional representatives, sending you requests for comprehensive services in the region.  All work, except for making changes to the client‚Äôs site, can be done by UserPoint employees on behalf of your company.  The studio receives not only more than 30% of the profits from the sale of new services, but also a new regular customer to refine the site. <br><br><h2>  Content Management Platform </h2><br>  SEO since the introduction of "Matriksnet" continues to give up their positions, and contextual advertising services are becoming increasingly popular.  Site owners lay serious budgets for the context.  Why don't you make it easier for them to manage their campaigns while getting their interest? <br><br>  <a href="http://elama.ru/partners"><b>eLama</b></a> is a free online service, thanks to which the user can manage advertising campaigns from a single interface.  Among the "buns" - autocomplete accounts, templates, payment of three contextual advertising systems from one account, plus to this - statistics data and much more.  If you are a representative of the agency, you can not only use the service to manage client campaigns, but also receive interest from the service (from 4 to 10% of the budget of the client‚Äôs advertising campaign).  And if you just bring clients, you will also receive interest from the client‚Äôs expenses, but in a different way (from 5 to 15% within half a year). <br><br><h2>  Online consultants </h2><br>  Whether the site sells real estate, travel vouchers, web hosting or insurance services - the built-in chat will help increase trust, promptly answer questions from potential customers, ensure their loyalty, and therefore improve sales.  Website owners understand this, and the built-in online consulting system today is a common part of the site development specification.  And for you - another opportunity to earn on the affiliate program. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.jivosite.ru/partnership"><b>JivoSite</b></a> is one of the online consulting services used by almost half of the websites on the Russian Internet, and it also has a program for partners: 30% of each payment by a client you bring, and the bonus is the free use of the service on your own website.  Working with the service is completely transparent for partners: you control client payments in your own personal account and have access to your client‚Äôs personal accounts for setting up. <br><br><h2>  Web Studio for web studios </h2><br>  There are situations when there are too many clients, or their requirements are too heavy for your specialists, or the budget simply does not suit you.  Do not rush to refuse such customers: you can attract other site developers to this order, having received legal interest for the found client. <br><br>  <a href="http://megagroup.ru/ap"><b>Megagroup</b></a> , for example, according to this scheme, offers from 12 to 30% of the cost of ordering sites and up to 35% when it comes to services.  Your task is to simply find a client and transfer his company contacts.  After the conclusion of the contract you will be transferred to the appropriate remuneration.  The process can be simplified by installing an appropriate widget with a design catalog on your website.  In this case, the application will be made automatically. <br><br><h2>  Online accounting </h2><br>  Cloud technologies and mobile devices have become a reality and significantly change the world around.  Today, thanks to SaaS, companies can do without renting offices, buying equipment and professional software packages.  Cloud accounting services for small and medium businesses are becoming increasingly popular.  Just yesterday, online CRM and project management systems seemed fantastic, today they are commonplace.  So why developing a website for a startup does not offer the customer to become a client of online accounting? <br>  The benefits of the client are obvious: he saves on the purchase of accounting software and equipment, removes the problems associated with the maintenance of the IT department and provides himself with flexibility in work, freedom and security.  And as an affiliate program participant, you will receive bonuses offered by the SaaS service provider. <br><br>  For example, <a href="https://www.moedelo.org/Agents/Registration/ForAgents"><b>My Case</b></a> under the program for regional representatives offers a reward for the initial sale of access to the service (50% of the tariff cost) and a reward for the renewal of access. <br>  Already today, the site is an integrated into a unified system of content management tools, customer accounting, social services and project management systems.  Tomorrow financial management systems will become part of the system, and you, developers, should think about it now. <br><br><h2>  Instead of conclusion </h2><br>  What affiliate programs does your web studio or agency participate in?  Are you thinking about expanding the range of services?  Can you recommend interesting affiliate programs? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296256/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296256/</a></p>
