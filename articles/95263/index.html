  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Following the release of the new application for the iPhone, Skype prepared video calls for the Nokia N900</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you are one of several thousand Nokia N900 owners, then this week Skype is going to offer you the opportunity to make video calls from your phone.  You can call any Skype user using a computer and talk to him in video mode, as told GigaOM Russ Show, head of the mobile direction in Skype.  Over time, it will be possible to call also users of other mobile versions of Skype and Skype for TVs. <br>  Shaw said that this is the result of ongoing work in close cooperation with Nokia.  Nokia N900 is equipped with two cameras - on the front and rear panels of the device.  Calls will work both via 3G and via Wi-Fi connection, although I am sure that on Wi-Fi it will be possible to get much higher quality.  Some of the smaller VoIP players such as <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/11/18/fring-now-works-on-android-does-skype-voip-calls/">Fring</a> have already submitted their applications with the ability to make video calls. <br>  ‚ÄúWe want to make video calls on all of our platforms, regardless of operating systems and operators,‚Äù said Shaw.  In other words, if the new iPhone (version 4) is equipped with two cameras, then Skype will make its application work on the iPhone.  According to a recent survey conducted by the company, 43% of Skype users want to have video in the mobile version of the program. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Ironically, on Friday, when I spoke with Shaw, he could not clarify the question of when the company would launch an iPhone application that can call over 3G, saying that they would not want to release a product that could do not meet user expectations.  And just <a href="http://blogs.skype.com/en/2010/05/iphone_calling_over_3g.html">24 hours later, this application</a> appeared in the iTunes App Store.  (While these calls are free, but Skype <a href="http://saunderslog.com/2010/05/30/skypes-small-fee-is-noise-guys/">is going to start taking money</a> for 3G calls, which makes me think that there is an agreement there that is similar to what <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/02/19/skype-verizon-deal-more-details/">Skype has with Verizon</a> . Another explanation can be <a href="http://andyabramson.blogs.com/voipwatch/2010/05/skype-on-3g-something-borrowed-something-new.html">read from Andy Abramson</a> , who believes that the secret of magic in the Skype SILK codec and fine work with the hardware of the iPhone). <br>  Shaw said the company was focused on ensuring smooth switching between 3G and Wi-Fi.  Be that as it may, it seems that the application has achieved its goals and even the <a href="http://patphelan.net/skype-2-0-gets-3g-calling/">harsh critics of the company expressed their approval</a> .  Skype data says it was downloaded 12 million times by iPhone and iPod touch users. <br>  The show also confirmed that the official Skype application for Android will be released later this year.  According to him, Skype focuses on iPhone and Symbian and Android phones.  This means, in particular, that Windows Phone and webOS do not yet appear in the company's plans.  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt do anything directly for Palm devices, but if there‚Äôs an operator who‚Äôs interested in it, we could work with it,‚Äù he said. This is part of the company's strategy of pushing operators away when it comes to operating systems with less than this threesome. <br>  How about RIM (BlackBerry)?  Shaw said that many people want a powerful multi-functional application [for this platform].  <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/02/15/skype-verizon-partnership/">Verizon subscribers can install Skype on their BlackBerry</a> through special relationship between companies.  In other words, all the other owners of the BlackBerry, wishing to set themselves Skype, have not been lucky. </div>
