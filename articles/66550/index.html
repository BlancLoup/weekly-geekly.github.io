      So, I dare to say that ideas lie under their feet, there are many of them, there are plenty of them, there are endless !!! <br><br>  The person is not perfect, the person is creative, and what one clever invented, the other stupid will simply copy, port, make a clone ... <br><br>  A practical one <i>will develop the</i> idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa product to be unrecognizable, say from the language B -&gt; C -&gt; C ++, from the fun of the <b>Xerox PARC</b> laboratory Jobs will do something unique and fulfill his promise to bring great technologies to the masses, this will be the <i>graphical interface</i> ! <br><br>  You think only in IT is that way ?!  Nothing of the kind, this is the case in all spheres, and in the theoretical sciences, and in general, almost all <s>new ideas of</s> discovery are made on the basis of other ideas, and close communication between researchers from all countries, races, religions and political views.  Even in the USSR, scientists communicated with scientists from other countries, but under censorship, but not always freely, but!  communication has never been interrupted, even during the Second World War !!! <br><br>  <i>As Newton said about his own work, <b>"only standing on the shoulders of giants,"</b> he managed to make discoveries.</i>  <i>Copernicus developed a theory of the Universe, Kepler derived a series of astronomical laws, Galileo demonstrated remarkable truths, Dr. Hook predicted the existence of attraction, Bullo said that "if gravity exists, it will decrease in square proportion as it moves away."</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Newton could only understand and then show that all the movements of the planets and their laws depend on one main force under the control of one immutable law, which together forms the real basis of physical science and mechanical motion.</i> <br><br>  What am I talking about?  Yes, all about the same, about ideas!  No need to invent anything, you just need to take the idea and make it easier, better, faster, more convenient ... For example, take the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa search engine and do better than Yahoo and you will have Google, take Minix and make Linux, take a guest book and make it - forum, take the forum, voting system, simplify, mix and make of them FaceBook ... Etc.  etc. <br><br>  We need large working capital or otherwise <br><br><h4>  Give me a foothold ... </h4><br><br>  And here, many are mistaken, <i>they think</i> that a good product is not enough, we need money, a lot, sometimes a lot to realize a brilliant idea ... So, this is also nonsense !!!  The same nonsense, how to declare that in order to become rich, I owe my mom and dad, or grandfather, to leave a legacy to a far-away relative to the extreme far!  Yes, there are those, but as a rule, the one to whom the jackpot falls from nowhere, then it merges into nowhere!  How come, so gone!  So, to become successful and rich, you need to work hard! <br><br>  And ideas?  Ideas lie under your feet, make something simpler, easier, better!  And if you are persistent, then everything will work out! <br><br>  And do not be scared to share ideas!  Natalia Nikolaevna Goncharova, reproached Alexander Sergeyevich, for what he gave the Examiner and the Dead Souls - to Gogol, to which A.S.  Pushkin joked that he had so many ideas that in all his life he did not have time to write!  But after all, A.S.  not everything was ingenious, not everything is original, starting from <s>Robin Hood</s> , Dubrovsky ... <br><br>  And with Gates, the Windows did not immediately turn out, but somehow all over the half-axis was done first ... <br><br>  Etc. <br><br>  PS <br>  <i>The topic was written a long time ago, it intersects with what I wrote yesterday, because the people complained that my vipervny topic is confused and incomprehensible, I wanted you to read it.</i>  <i>Thank you.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66550/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66550/</a></p>
