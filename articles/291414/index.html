      The article is divided into sub categories, in each you can emphasize for yourself something useful! <br><br>  <b>1. Outsourcing company, freelancer or inhouse lawyer?</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a72/690/2ac/a726902ac1b742cf8515236af65b7134.png"><br><br>  Naturally, every entrepreneur has his own approach to organizing business processes and building a team. <br><br>  Someone likes to keep in the staff only the necessary for the main activity of employees, and the remaining tasks to be outsourced (to freelancers or companies) <br><br>  Someone prefers to hire in-house workers, and not use the services of outsourcers. <br><br>  <b>What are the advantages of working with an outsourcing company?</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e22/b76/e7a/e22b76e7a6274f308f93ceb98aec34d6.jpg"><br><br>  - You hire a team, which reduces the likelihood of errors.  Every lawyer has strengths and weaknesses.  The right team allows you to annihilate weaknesses. <br><br>  More than two years we spent on the selection of the necessary team. <br><br>  - A properly selected company does not require constant payments, unlike an in-house lawyer, but works on the principle of time &amp; material or fixed cost for certain works / services. <br><br>  Subscription services (monthly payments for legal entities), in our opinion, are ‚Äúpumping out money‚Äù. <br>  <u>We work on the principle of time &amp; material and fixed cost.</u> <br><br>  - The lawyer has 168 working productive hours per month (excluding overtime).  By hiring a company, you significantly increase the number of productive hours per month at the expense of a team of lawyers. <br><br>  <b>What are the advantages of hiring in-house lawyers?</b> <br>  They can be ‚Äúplanted‚Äù in their office, which guarantees constant ‚Äúlive‚Äù communication. <br>  But, in the era of Internet technology, you can also communicate online ... which sometimes saves time. <br><br>  <b>What are the advantages of hiring freelancers?</b> <br>  Probably ... the price.  As research shows, the rate of freelancer in most cases is below the rate of the company's outsourcing. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> <br>  If you are in the most severe cost saving mode, but you have time, look for a freelancer. <br>  If you like to communicate ‚Äúlive‚Äù with the performer and see him every day in your office - look for an in-house lawyer <br><br>  If you rely on high-quality, timely legal support, with an understandable pricing policy, please contact <a href="http://law-boot.com/">LAWBOOT Lawyers &amp; Consultants</a> . <br><br>  If you cooperate, or are going to cooperate with another company, be careful with the ‚Äúsubscriber service‚Äù, most likely it is not profitable for you. <br><br>  <b>2. Type of company or lawyer and ‚Äúthe principle of 30 minutes‚Äù</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/353/f45/e8c/353f45e8c2d8417194675f731ce30c2b.jpg"><br><br>  Now developing such a direction as IT Lawyers. <br>  These are companies and lawyers who ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù their services for the developing Internet technology industry. <br><br>  <b>The main characteristics of good IT lawyers:</b> <br><br>  1) have to understand IT projects and know their specifics (if a lawyer does not know and does not understand what a cookie is, google extension, what is monetization and what they are like, traffic, P2P technologies, what are the risks in outsourcing, what is Internet acquiring and why do they need PCI DSS, what is SaaS, how are investments made in start-ups, etc. THEN YOU ARE NOT ON THE ROAD!) <br><br>  2) in simple words - should be able to move money from one country to another with minimal risks and tax losses. <br><br>  3) to own IT terminology (the slang for "non-IT professionals" is not clear). <br><br>  4) should possess knowledge in the field of local and global corporate, copyright, tax and as a bonus of criminal law. <br><br>  An experienced IT lawyer should, within a minute, understand what an Internet entrepreneur is doing, within the next 15 minutes, ask additional questions about the project, and after 15 minutes, suggest a specific plan of action. <br><br>  <b>Let's call it the ‚Äú30 minutes principle.‚Äù</b> <br><br>  By the way, lawyers at <a href="http://law-boot.com/">LAWBOOT Lawyers &amp; Consultants</a> during the interview go through one of the stages of selection according to the ‚Äú30 minutes principle‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> If you are engaged in IT business - look for an IT lawyer. <br><br>  <b>3. Competence assessment</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff4/945/858/ff49458585d849a5bc2b71cae6ca3db5.jpg"><br><br>  Before contacting a company or a lawyer, you must check: <br><br>  - with whom he works (but do not forget that legal services are of an ‚Äúintimate‚Äù nature, and many lawyers do not have the right to disclose information about their clients. It all depends on the desire of the client); <br>  - what reviews about it are on the Internet; <br>  - Competence according to the ‚Äú30 minutes principle‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>4. Reputation myth</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/415/aeb/7bf/415aeb7bfc234184b0359a54cb85db97.jpg"><br>  Reputation is a necessary thing, but at the same time, reputation is an abstract concept that does not guarantee the quality of service performance. <br><br>  It is quite foolish to pay top network companies for their pseudo-reputation just because they are big and have an office in the capital's coolest business center. <br><br>  As they said in the ‚Äúdashing 90s‚Äù, <b>there are two real guarantees - this is a prepayment and an automatic machine.</b> <br>  Since the machine and IT business are incompatible, we advise you to use the second guarantee - prepay. <br><br>  <b>5. Prepay</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f2/715/dbe/9f2715dbeaec4d2d821e99eedbe16f40.jpg"><br><br>  A good lawyer, confident in the quality of his work, and having a stream of clients will not ask for 100% prepayment for his services. <br><br>  To protect your interests, insist on an advance payment of no more than 20%.  So you share the risks, and can monitor the progress of the task and the quality of the final result. <br><br>  For lawyers themselves, the remaining 80% is the motivation to follow through. <br><br>  <a href="http://law-boot.com/">LAWBOOT Lawyers &amp; Consultants</a> works according to this principle. <br><br>  <b>6. Warranties and liability</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/33d/5e6/cb1/33d5e6cb198b46298aca0c13ec910df5.jpg"><br><br>  Large network law companies, as a rule, are liable to the counterparty in the amount of their fee and take 100% prepayment for their services. <br><br>  Those.  if they ‚Äúfix‚Äù - they (probably!) will return to the client an amount equal to their fee. <br><br>  The study showed that individuals - lawyers do not assume any responsibility to the client. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> <br>  When lawyers ask you to make a 100% prepayment for services and say: ‚ÄúWe give you a 100% guarantee that everything will be OK,‚Äù remember the lawyer‚Äôs responsibility‚Ä¶ <br><br>  <b>7. Cost of services</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31d/d1c/4c2/31dd1c4c23644e6baa16bc22421da7a5.png"><br><br>  Expensive is not always good, cheap is not always bad.  This rule works everywhere, including in the world of jurisprudence. <br><br>  In the CIS market, IT lawyers' rates vary from 15 to 350 usd per hour.  In rare cases, and met above. <br><br>  Reith is by no means an indicator of professionalism.  This is only a subjective (with economic overtones) assessment of the cost per hour of work of a specialist. <br><br>  Be careful, many lawyers are not able to add up the price of their services, and form it depending on the ‚Äúfatness‚Äù of the client. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://law-boot.com/">LAWBOOT Lawyers &amp; Consultants</a> learned how to work with a client from IT specialists.</b> <br><br>  We sell template services at fixed cost, and we evaluate unique, non-template tasks in the form of a hatching with a detailed road map which consists of consecutive iterations, where the client sees where and why the team needs to spend time and for what end result the client will pay. <br><br>  <b>8. Lawyers abroad</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/668/03a/850/66803a8503c645e4885d46da492c8f07.jpg"><br><br>  Finding a good lawyer outside the CIS is even more difficult than inside the CIS.  In establishing a partnership, you can be hindered by a language barrier, a difference in mentality, inability to set a task and control the process of its implementation, as well as sky-high price tags for the services of ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù lawyers. <br><br>  Our CEO spent a lot of time and money on finding partners, personal meetings with them for the purpose of registering with the help of foreign companies in the future and receiving legal consulting services. <br><br>  Outside there are no less fraudsters and unscrupulous workers (including lawyers) than in the CIS. <br>  We met lawyers with rates of 350+ bucks, and we found errors in their consultations.  (we then hoped that in the USA the principle is expensive = works well, but we were not lazy to check). <br><br>  This is another advantage of working with <a href="http://law-boot.com/">LAWBOOT Lawyers &amp; Consultants</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d22/85b/d6f/d2285bd6f2584eb39fa732b81ced6c48.png"><br><br>  We already have our own team, a large number of clients, experience, proven partners abroad, as well as the ability to control the results of their work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291414/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291414/</a></p>
