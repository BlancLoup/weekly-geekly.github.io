  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Acronis People 2: Start a career in Acronis. How, instead of a cozy internship, I got into the development hell</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Acronis on Fiztekh know many students.  Founded by MIPT graduates, Sergey Belousov and Stanislav Protasov, Acronis has always been perceived by students as a great place to start their careers in the IT field.  Therefore, when I had the opportunity to have an internship here, I tried not to miss it, after going through several stages of interviews, I got the desired internship in Acronis.  The main advantage of this internship program is that, at its core, this is not exactly an internship, but a real work on projects as part of a team of the coolest developers. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/acronis/blog/304190/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a8/223/6e0/5a82236e00a046a7a63d65b78736b012.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the beginning of the internship, I was given relatively simple tasks related to configuring finished products and auto-testing.  Now I‚Äôm already working as part time junior programmer in the Acronis vice president for engineering and development, Kirill Korotayev, and my tasks are related to the implementation of the S3 protocol for Object Storage and the utilities for backup and migration of the S3 storage with the Virtuozzo team. <br><br>  On average, I work for 20 hours per week, which allows me to successfully combine work and study at MIPT.  From this point of view, Acronis is a great place to work for an intelligent student.  Many of my colleagues, just like me, started working as early as my student years and therefore are sympathetic to the fact that I need to adjust my work schedule for the educational process and change it if I urgently need to be present at the university.  In this regard, I was also lucky with the choice of university, the educational process at MIPT is structured in such a way that I myself can choose the groups with which to attend seminars at a convenient time for me.

      Even under the condition that I work two days a week for six hours and two days for four, I spend my studies on weekends, and in the evenings on weekdays I try to relax, I like to walk in the center of Moscow, do acrobatics and volleyball in the Acronis team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c2/473/a09/1c2473a09e5e45b7b93064cb0c90f14a.jpg"><br><br>  When I came to Acronis, I didn‚Äôt fully understand how a company could deal with a specific direction and develop such a product line.  However, I quickly realized that, although Backup is to some extent a narrow IT area, it always contains branches that allow you to learn something new, get acquainted with new patterns, technologies and acquire additional skills.  For a novice programmer, it is very useful to work on new tasks, because this is the only way to gain experience and grow professionally. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fef/6ae/832/fef6ae8323bd4a92a1d7ce6423db8c11.jpg"><br><br>  At the very beginning of my work I had a very illustrative case.  I came to the company as a C ++ programmer.  But.  it so happened that my very first task was related to writing code in Python.  For two months, I ‚Äúon the move‚Äù taught a new programming language for myself, and in the end I mastered it quite well.  An important factor in my success was the fact that the development team, of which I became a part, helped me in mastering Python with useful tips, comments and recommendations.  For me, it was partly surprising that Vice-President Kirill Korotaev was engaged in direct development no less than all the other members of the team.  It is always very ‚Äúwarming the soul‚Äù when you realize that tasks do not come from somewhere above, from the ivory tower, and the leader is the top developer who solves them with you, side by side, himself makes "hands". <br><br>  In Acronis, I was able to acquire not only programming skills in new languages, but, it seems to me, equally important skills are to set priorities in solving your tasks, to focus on, to maintain proper quality, and to prioritize were made on time, still learned how to quickly and deeply search and analyze information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/82f/419/4af/82f4194afe534b94bf908d358cc12817.jpg"><br><br>  Today, six months later, I see my mission at Acronis in ensuring the fullest possible preservation of our users' data, to provide them with the most complete sense of security and confidence that our product will not fail.  In order to achieve this, we must take into account a huge number of risk factors: whether it be any technical problems or unpredictable actions of users, also try to minimize them. <br><br>  Therefore, if the thoughts that I have described are close to you, and you want to get a job in Acronis, then, first of all, you need to evaluate your background, find what was really interesting for you, and understand what knowledge you will lack in interest. your position. <br><br>  On the link below you can see the open positions of the company: <br><br>  ¬ª <a href="http://www.acronis.com/ru-ru/company/employment/vacancy/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dacronis-people-2">Http://www.acronis.com/ru-ru/company/employment/vacancy/</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/741/02f/6c0/74102f6c0c624f659f244c7a59091f8d.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304190/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304190/</a></p>
