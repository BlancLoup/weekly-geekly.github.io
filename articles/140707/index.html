And two reports: Dmitry Tarasov, CEO of Tarasov Mobile - <b>‚ÄúApps that make sense‚Äù</b> , and Ilya Shpankov, Development Manager of Opera in Russia - <b>‚ÄúMobile Opera Browsers in Russia‚Äù</b> . <br><br>  The main organizer of the conference, <b>Alexander Zverev</b> , CEO of <a href="http://e-legion.ru/">e-Legion</a> , took the role of moderator of the entire conference. <br><br>  Video presentations are already being assembled and are being prepared for publication on the youtube with Russian subtitles, but for now we will tell who spoke and what was discussed in the sections and reports of the participants. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Section "Device Manufacturers" </h4><br>  The moderator was <b>Olga Shtaidl</b> , owner of <a href="http://dotsandspaces.com/">dots'n'spaces</a> and co-organizer of # MBLT12.  Ola Larsen, Andrei Kiselev (BlackBerry) and Dmitry Gorilovsky (Yota) took part in this section.  The main topic of discussion was the future of mobile devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/716/52a/232/71652a232b9c064f3442f9a5c10eb9ba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In parallel with the main program, the conference guests in the small hall could join Yandex Mobile Camp, where Yandex specialists shared valuable knowledge in the field of mobile development with developers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/886/6cb/098/8866cb098106531db266b3a4a85e8947.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Vlad Alekseev</b> told about the basics of developing applications for iOS.  <b>Konstantin Zaikin</b> wrote a counter for Windows Phone.  <b>Alexey Dodonov</b> told about his experience of using Core Data - a simple and clear way to access data.  <b>Roman Busygin</b> told about auto-assembly of iOS projects.  And <b>Andrei Subbotin</b> on a step-by-step example showed how to deal with localization problems. <br><br><h4>  Section "Mobile Marketing" </h4><br>  The moderator of the section was <b>Daria Batukhtina</b> - an experienced expert on communications and PR in Europe and Russia.  In the allotted 60 minutes, she wanted to discuss various cases on the promotion of mobile applications in Russia and in the West. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37d/a56/e62/37da56e6250a0201edbe192430b9d4b8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Competent experts in the field of mobile marketing were called to help her: Emin Aliyev (Lumata Group), Zoya Adamovich (Xyologic), Igor Shvartsman (Third Wave), Ekaterina Zholobova (Nevosoft), Andrei Rumyantsev (WapStart). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a7/cf9/a1f/7a7cf9a1f091095f011169fe54cca785.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To the question ‚ÄúWhat is the difference between promotion methods in Russia and in Europe?‚Äù Daria Batukhtina answered: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚Äú <i>The thing is that we have a very different market.</i>  <i>In Russia, at the moment, only three million Android devices and a half million iPhones.</i>  <i>Now more conservative methods are working, the client uses mobile marketing to promote the brand, for example, creating a mobile application for radio listeners.</i>  <i>Business tasks are rarely taken into account when talking about mobile communications.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>But the situation is changing.</i>  <i>Take, the same restaurant chain Tanuki, which developed the mobile application and used it as a completely new sales channel.</i>  <i>The potential of a mobile audience in Russia is very high, as it is not fed up with mobile advertising, it reacts to creativity and enthusiastically uses the new opportunities provided to it through mobile marketing.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>By the way, we, by the way, are more close to Europeans - we are ready to buy using mobile devices if we are provided with a comfortable solution for this.</i>  <i>But Americans do not trust mobile advertising and, for example, try to make all purchases through a computer, and not mobile or tablet</i> . ‚Äù </blockquote><br><h4>  Section "Internet of Things" </h4><br>  In the words of the main futurologist at Cisco, Dave Evans: ‚ÄúThe Internet of things is a new stage in the development of the Internet, greatly expanding the possibilities of collecting, analyzing and distributing data that a person can turn into information.‚Äù <br><br><img src="http://img36.imageshack.us/img36/5024/4sect.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The founder of the company <a href="http://thirdwaveberlin.com/">Third Wave</a> - <b>Igor Shvartsman</b> , together with Dmitry Gorilovsky (Yota), Evgeny Pavlov (HTC) and Denis Nochevnov (Megafon) discussed this topic of our time. <br><br><h4>  Report "Apps That Make Sense" </h4><br>  In his presentation, the CEO of <a href="http://www.tarasov-mobile.com/">Tarasov Mobile</a> , <b>Dmitry Tarasov</b> , with specific examples, reviewed the main trends in the development of a market of meaningful mobile applications that are created for a specific target audience and solve a specific task, helping users, and not taking time away from them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b74/9c8/b0b/b749c8b0bd881faeca1bf4dbe2245290.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><blockquote>  ‚Äú <i>Such examples inspire us, in Tarasov Mobile, clearly demonstrating that a mobile device can not only entertain the user, but also help him keep things in order, be a companion in everyday matters, as well as improve in something real, and not in launching birds in pigs</i> "- said Dmitry Tarasov categorically. </blockquote><br><h4>  Section "Game Development" </h4><br>  <b>Igor Pusenyak</b> , CEO of <a href="http://www.limasky.com/">Lima Sky</a> , the creator of one of the most popular mobile games Doodle Jump, specially came from New York to Moscow to become an expert in the ‚ÄúGame Development‚Äù section at the # MBLT12 conference. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4af/c96/a36/4afc96a367a18ec9b5323c1e320c5a76.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Igor and Igor Chernomordikov (Microsoft), Ekaterina Zholobova (Nevosoft), Ivan Belyi (Marmelad) and Alex Patsay (Mail.Ru Group) discussed the current issues of game development with Igor.  The moderator of the section was charismatic <b>Mikhail Denisov</b> from the company ‚Äú <a href="http://alloka.ru/">Alloka</a> ‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Section "Mobile Browsers" </h4><br>  <b>Leonid Bugaev</b> , creative director of Nordic Agency AB, led the mobile browsers section. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be3/83f/c6d/be383fc6dd39e38776e4cb04e5461781.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What can we expect from LTE mobile data transmission technology in Russia?  Mobile website or mobile application?  These and many other questions were answered by invited experts: Ilya Shpankov (Opera), Mikhail Dmitriev (ComputerBild), Konstantin Kichinsky (Microsoft) and Raphael Stoffman (InfoGin). <br><br><h4>  Section "Mobile developers" </h4><br>  The developer section was <a href="http://www.camerjam.com/">moderated</a> by the charismatic Briton <b>James Cameron</b> , CEO of <a href="http://www.camerjam.com/">Camerjam</a> .  Marcel Pirlich (Adspert), Max Mironchik (Intellectsoft), Dmitry Tarsov (Tarasov Mobile), Mikhail Chernomordikov (Microsoft) and Dmitry Zaitsev (Devexperts) discussed the technical aspects of creating mobile applications as experts of the section. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/140/168/ce3/140168ce3c0f399320eae8a289b9f349.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A positive atmosphere reigned on stage: IntellectSoft's technical director was unable to sit on the sofa and wander around the stage, Mikhail Chernomordikov unobtrusively argued to everyone that the future was for Windows Phone, all the experts had long argued about the future of HTML5.  The section moderator needed only to maintain a high degree of discussion. <br><br><h4>  Mobile Advertising Section </h4><br>  The moderator of the section <b>Projol Banergea</b> from <a href="http://www.sponsorpay.com/">SponsorPay</a> discussed mobile advertising issues with Mikhail Maly (Begun), Dmitry Lazarev (Out There Media), Alexander Savin (Mail.Ru), Nikita Drozdov (Mobile Advertisement Center) and Nick Mikhailovsky (POIdo) ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/960/027/28b/96002728b2da8f92b02b236d68dd14a2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The questions in the section were divided into 8 big points and the experts barely had time to keep up with the answers on time. <br><br><h4>  The report ‚ÄúMobile Opera browsers in Russia‚Äù </h4><br>  The conference ended with a report by <b>Ilya Shpankov</b> from <a href="http://opera.com/">Opera Software</a> .  To his speech, Ilya made a great presentation, which we decided to put in advance when the video was not yet ready: <br><br><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/12156946&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhgGPOAP3DVMLRQbiGRAZ7Lg3ghxg" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br><br>  There are a lot of statistics and conclusions about the future of Opera and the mobile industry in the presentation.  According to Ilya‚Äôs interesting opinion: ‚ÄúThe <i>web is our past, mobile technologies are the present, and TV is the future</i> .‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  Turning to the results, I would like to mention the general partners of the event, without whom we could not hold a conference at the proper level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/961/89e/778/96189e778be4df53ce5e0438744af10b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Following the conference, we want to make a <b>series of posts</b> with unique content from the conference.  Each post will be devoted to a separate section with video, transcript and translation.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/e-Legion/">Subscribe</a> to stay up to date. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140707/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140707/</a></p>
