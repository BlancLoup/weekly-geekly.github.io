      When I entered the project in a state of personal recession, I quickly realized that even the best hired employee didn‚Äôt have the approach to planning time and organizing affairs, and promptly began to ‚Äúchop down‚Äù everything unnecessary, gradually optimizing the remaining most important thing. <br><br>  It should be added that my project was related to the <b>Programmatic Buying</b> ecosystem (hereinafter referred to as PB), and Know How did not have to do any of its technologies, did not even have to buy foreign and expensive ones.  There is enough business in new ecosystems without a ‚Äútechnological component‚Äù. <br><br>  So: <br>  1) I started by completing all the few games (the only one); <br>  2) Disconnected all notifications in extra groups in the FB and unsubscribed from non-thematic mailings; <br>  3) Introduced a limit on the length of the working day at 9 o'clock (work without restrictions turns from an infusorian shoe into an ugly ameba); <br>  3) Introduced color differentiation in the Google calendar and began to take into account the duration of cases; <br>  4) I carried all documents to the cloud as much as possible in order to work from anywhere with a mobile, the subway would help me. <br><br>  I was incredibly lucky with the employee who was identified by my partner, because this man turned out to be just great, we quickly found a common language and moved forward to the stars.  To deceive myself, I started work immediately after leaving the house, checking mail and social networks on the go, allowed myself to linger at work for 15-40 minutes and did everything 10-20% faster than planned, I worked as much as possible on the incoming stream - 9 out of 10 correspondences in FB went to the work plane, and there was no time left on LinkedIn and VK. <br><br>  Because of this, I quickly realized that the initial product with which I entered the market was less than 10% of the total needs of PB and began to move in this direction by writing the product into my sales funnel.  After reading the first 15 pages of Lean StartUp, I completed the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù funnel, starting cooperation with the sale of a consulting package (3 hours at 2,000 rubles to VAT) and leaving the opportunity to sell consulting further packages to improve resiliency. <br><br>  After a couple of months, it turned out that even before the start of the project I had provided myself with a couple of cases: <br>  1) Provided a search for a PB partner from the Russian Federation for the representation of Dentsu Aegis in Armenia; <br>  2) Found a qualified employee with work experience for the projects ‚ÄúImpruv Media‚Äù (InMyRoom.ru, etc.) to work with the advertising management system AdFox, which saved them about 360,000 rubles / year <br><br>  And then, in order to make everything beautiful, I added the ‚Äúcherry on the cake‚Äù to my funnel from the bottom - communicating with potential customers, I revealed to them the possibility of using PB to tune out competitors, create new products, increase margins, etc., and in return they They gave me letters of thanks and gradually began to "fill their piggy bank." <br><br>  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6VKmGsrBJigOGlRT0RvdVBydDRuQlNwS1c3Q2F0Y3dZeXVR/view%3Fusp%3Dsharing">Thank you letters</a> from the first two cases successfully fit. <br><br>  In the second month of work on the project, I reorganized my calendar according to the concept of ‚ÄúMental time management‚Äù, which I had invented ahead of time, divided into short (10-15 min), medium (30 min) and long (1-2 hours) cases, in the calendar began to alternate them to constantly change the pace of work.  The pace of work turned out like this: <br><br>  - Doing things for short cases, handling mail and social networks.  What can I not do - I do not do it, if I do it, I do it in the shortest, but the best way, with respect for work and personal ethics.  In order not to be distracted and keep up the pace included the composition ‚ÄúEye of the tiger‚Äù; <br>  - Thoughtful optimalism for medium-sized businesses, with calm, soft music with constant time control and an attempt to achieve an optimal result; <br>  - Adaptive speaker for meetings and negotiations.  For each meeting, I planned 90 minutes, compulsorily identified my interests and the structure of the funnel, conducted a client survey about the structure of his business and carried out all the long topics to personal thinking and working correspondence.  It is not uncommon at the meeting to give out hasty answers with which the interlocutor with a probability of 97.3% will want to argue.  And ended the meeting in 40-50 minutes.  Record 17 minutes. <br><br>  Continue? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294010/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294010/</a></p>
