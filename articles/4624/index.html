Another 6% of the shares will be acquired after the Russian regulatory authorities give permission for this. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFor Prof-Media, this transaction is a key step towards the formation of the largest diversified media holding with a strong position in the new media segment,‚Äù commented Rafael Akopov, CEO of the company.  - The Rambler Media stake, which focuses solely on the online business, will become an important element in the Prof-Media development strategy on the Internet. <br><br>  According to Vladislav Kochetkov, head of the press service of the investment company Finam, the deal can be estimated at $ 80-100 million. ‚ÄúNow the market capitalization of Rambler is approaching $ 470 million,‚Äù says Kochetkov.  - However, it is unlikely that someone would buy a company for this amount.  We estimate today's deal at $ 80-100 million. In addition, shareholders received about $ 25 million for Rambler-TV.  Taking into account the fact that before holding an IPO, this asset was estimated at twice the price, we can say that Rambler is ready to make substantial concessions compared to its market value.  Shareholders received up to $ 125 million for TV and the company's controlling stake. A completely acceptable amount for such an asset. ‚Äù

      ‚ÄúFirst Mercantile Asset Management Ltd (the largest shareholder of Rambler Media, - <i>approx. Edition</i> ) has long been looking for an opportunity to sell the company,‚Äù says a source familiar with the situation in the company who asked for anonymity.  - Even the figure was called - $ 150 million for 75% of the company's shares, before being placed on the exchange.  For this amount, the shareholders were ready to part with a headache that did not allow to sleep peacefully.  Recently, Rambler has lost its leading position in Runet, moreover, last year it slipped into third place in the top three largest domestic Internet companies, giving way to the second line of Mail.ru.  Most likely, after the completion of the transaction, ‚ÄúRambler‚Äù will be abandoned by managers who made decisions of previous shareholders, for example, Irina Hoffman, the current CEO of the company.  Perhaps there will be other "cleansing" in the manual, it all depends on the position of Prof-Media.  If Rambler Media is considered as a non-core asset, serious changes can hardly be expected.  "Rambler" will continue to go with the flow. " <br><br>  Mail.Ru CEO Dmitry Grishin believes that in the near future Rambler will develop information direction.  ‚ÄúThere is a feeling that after the purchase of Prof-Media, Rambler should go even deeper into creating content-informational projects, to which they are already lately,‚Äù Grishin commented on the deal.  ‚ÄúI think that in this field they will compete more with RBC than with Mail.Ru or Yandex, so the situation seems more positive to us.‚Äù <br><br>  Rambler Media is one of the largest Russian Internet companies, including entertainment resources, online services, providing content delivery services.  The Rambler search engine is the second most popular search engine on the Russian Internet and is one of the three most popular Russian Internet sites in terms of traffic and page views.  According to the company's own data, the main Internet resource Rambler Media, the <a href="http://www.rambler.ru/">Rambler.Ru</a> portal, is visited monthly by 21 million people, the number of page impressions exceeds 1.5 billion a month.  In the first half of 2006, the consolidated revenues of Rambler Media amounted to $ 16 million, net profit - about $ 2.5 million. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4624/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4624/</a></p>
