We offer you 10 ways to motivate a client, which are based on current psychological research.  They explain how to influence the maximum number of visitors so that they can start using your product.  Below are the first five of them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Help clients overcome the ‚Äúfear of committing an action‚Äù by setting minimum requirements.</b>

      Research by Professor Robert Kialdini showed that adding the most minimal amount to the list increased the number of donations to the American Cancer Society by 78%.  That is, people were afraid to pay a lot at once, but they were ready to sacrifice little. <br><br>  Remind your customers how easy it is to start working with you (‚ÄúUse our product for the first month for free!‚Äù) To help them overcome the ‚Äúfear of committing an action‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c3/3a9/dee/3c33a9dee75b4e46834587afd2961f5a.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Source - <a href="http://netflix.com/">Netflix</a></i> <br><br>  Or if you do not have freemium, then you can promise a refund if something does not like or there will be no result. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f77/e14/cf1/f77e14cf1c554d5eb1b9819b2e4b50fc.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://preply.com/"><i>A source</i></a> <br><br>  <b>2. Highlight your customers!</b> <br><br>  During the study of behavioral patterns in the voting, scientists concluded that people randomly designated as "politically active" were 15% more likely to vote. <br><br>  Despite the fact that they were chosen completely by chance, it was their selection among other people that predetermined their further actions.  Highlight your customers, make them part of a VIP group, and actions will match their characteristics. <br><br>  Whole businesses are created on this base.  For example, the online store <a href="http://www.kupivip.ru/">KupiVip</a> , where women are available super-brands at low prices.  But at the lower quality they will not agree.  Both auto dealers and Apple equipment manufacturers create images of their customers.  Calling a certain group of people their typical customers, they do not leave people a choice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f3/ffe/1bd/0f3ffe1bdca146688e1592bcfd8ab992.jpg"><br><br>  <b>3. There are three types of users.</b> <br><br>  Experts in neuroeconomics have conducted studies according to which all buyers can be divided into three types: misers, spenders, and average buyers. <br>  If you want to sell a product to a typical miser, be sure to concentrate on what is in the composition of a product, use the method of buying on credit ($ 100 per month during the year, and not $ 1,200 at once).  In addition, reduce the number of small additional costs (for example, for delivery). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/139/88a/b79/13988ab796ea4cfcb753c66aeb178d00.jpg"><br>  <i><a href="http://wp7forum.ru/muzykalnyj-servis-nokia-music-dostupen-v-rossii-cena-podpiski-priyatno-udivlyaet/">A source</a></i> <br><br>  Spenders are actively buying at the wow-effect and immediately, so strive to increase their average bill and offer several products in addition to what they were initially interested in. <br><br>  <b>4. Highlight your strengths while acknowledging weaknesses</b> <br><br>  According to information provided by social psychologist Fiona Lee, users trust those companies that recognize their ‚Äústrategic flaws‚Äù more than those who blame someone else for their problems (even if it really was so!). <br><br>  The researcher concluded that customers are loyal to companies that occasionally admit their mistakes, as they are really trying to correct the shortcomings, instead of looking for the problem in others. <br><br>  How right: We can do better! <br><br>  How wrong: This is not our fault! <br><br>  For example, report your minor flaw, which is not critical for the user, but which allows them to understand that you soberly assess yourself. <br><br>  For example, Ecco honestly write about all the details of delivery, recognizing both the advantages of some options and the disadvantages of others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1e/78a/4d0/f1e78a4d0ff0416e8df56be47c03a8a4.png"><br>  <i><a href="http://www.ecco-shoes.ru/">A source</a></i> <br><br>  Another simple example: your packs of white paper are different in density, print quality, whiteness.  But, nevertheless, they are not universal and are not compatible with such and such types of printers.  For them, it is better to choose paper from your other line. <br><br>  <b>5. Be persistent, but in moderation</b> <br><br>  It is the persistence of company representatives and the scarcity of goods that drive successful sales.  According to a study by Howard Levental, users tend to block persistent messages unless they are given clear information about subsequent actions. <br><br>  Leventhal proved this theory with a tetanus vaccine, and came to the conclusion that people who received information about subsequent actions decided to vaccinate 25% more readily. <br><br>  Draw both for yourself and for the client the chain of actions that will lead him to the result.  If the client does not understand the way to interact with your product, the probability of his leaving the site is more than 90%.  Refer to the examples of the MailChimp SaaS service, which step by step draws on its website both the process of creating a letter and the process of sending it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/406/129/bcc/406129bcc9af41e0ba8cdb3d479c1022.jpg"><br><br>  <i><a href="http://www.crowdspottr.com/">A source</a></i> <br><br>  Recall various tests, where you are told a) how many questions there will be, b) how much time you have, c) draw a progress scale, d) report in quantitative terms how many questions are left to the end. <br><br>  Source: <a href="">blog.kissmetrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ConvertMoreCustomers.jpg</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/232485/">https://habr.com/ru/post/232485/</a></p>
