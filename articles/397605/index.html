A little later, already to the trio, the Federal State Unitary Enterprise ‚ÄúResearch Automotive Institute‚Äù (NAMI) joined as a technology partner of the project.

      Yandex already has its own Yandex.Taxi transport service, which is necessary for developing high-precision Yandex.Maps maps and software development opportunities.  KamAZ has machine-building facilities, on the basis of which companies plan to develop, first of all, an intelligent driver assistance system.  An example is the retention of a car in a lane, the execution of an emergency braking maneuver and control of the driver. <br><br>  Also, the press service of Yandex for Geektimes answered a number of questions regarding future cooperation with KamAZ. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On the question of what technologies Yandex already has, the press secretary Dmitry Gorchakov has the technologies that are suitable for creating robotized cars, and said that working together with KamAZ specialists will be carried out in several areas: <br><br><blockquote>  The first is the adaptation of Yandex services for cars (including taking into account the characteristics of trucks), the introduction of voice control multimedia system of the car and its integration with a mobile device.  It is also about creating high-precision maps and solutions for semi-autonomous driving, based on a set of technologies of artificial intelligence of Yandex: computer vision, machine learning, speech technologies.  In the framework of cooperation, it is planned to develop a driver assistance system capable of keeping the car in the lane, initiate emergency braking, and control the degree of driver fatigue. </blockquote><br>  According to the representative of ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù, the company's <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D1%258C%25D1%258E%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B7%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">computer vision</a> technology allows ‚Äúto read all the necessary information about the situation on the roads‚Äù.  Next, the data is processed and, based on the result obtained, the Yandex algorithms will be able to build the vehicle movement.  This includes controlling the trajectory, accelerating, braking and, of course, keeping the vehicle in one lane when driving on the highway. <br><br>  BigData analysis technologies will also be applied.  The information obtained from the sensors will allow diagnostics of malfunctions for carrying out timely repairs and, according to a company representative, to prevent emergencies. <br><br>  Of course navigation was mentioned.  Yandex has fairly accurate maps that the company has been developing for a long time.  Based on them, the Internet giant plans to provide ready-made solutions for any type of transport. <br><br>  The company is actively increasing its presence in the automotive market.  Thus, according to <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/08/25/654395-yandeks-avtomaticheskogo-upravleniya">Vedomosti</a> , Yandex is embedding its Navigator application in the on-board computers of cars sold on the Russian market.  For example, the Navigator is equipped with computers of Honda and Toyota Camry Exclusive cars. <br><br>  Dmitry Gorchakov noted that KamAZ will be responsible for the hardware complex represented by the car.  However, the company is actively looking for other partners in the Russian market.  One of the potential - AvtoVAZ. <br><br>  From answering the question about the stage of developing high-precision maps for the future of robotic vehicles, the press service chose to abstain. <br><br>  To work on the data and other projects of unmanned vehicles of the company, a separate laboratory of embedded automotive solutions was created, and its leader, Andrey Vasilevsky, gave a <a href="https://meduza.io/feature/2016/08/28/voditelya-v-avtomobile-mozhet-i-ne-okazatsya">big interview for Medusa</a> in late August, in which he spoke about the details of the unit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397605/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397605/</a></p>
