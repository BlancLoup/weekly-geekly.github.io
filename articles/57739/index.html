  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Innovative factors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Analysis of the process and results of innovation activity showed its dependence on the prerequisites, the main of which can be formulated as factors: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>World threshold of knowledge</b> It serves as a boundary between achievements and gaps in general and specialized knowledge.  The knowledge threshold provides the scientific community with a guideline for further exploratory basic and applied research, and the engineering and management building provides the basis for targeted applied research.  Indicators of achievements in general scientific knowledge are discoveries - previously unknown scientific results that radically increase the level of knowledge, and in special knowledge - products of applied research and development that have received international recognition.  Indicators of gaps in knowledge include problems in society and the environment that require urgent solutions - lack of energy, environmental and social security, diseases, natural disasters. <br><br>  <b>Innovative financial resources The</b> possibility of financing innovative projects is determined by the physical availability and availability of capital invested today for the sake of future high returns in the event of not entirely obvious success.  Innovative financial resources can be risk capital invested to generate high profits, or non-profit, such as subventions, for which the return is the achievement of goals important to sustainable development.  A typical terminal for commercial risk capital is a venture capital firm, and for a non-profit fund a public science foundation.  Accordingly, in the first case, its sources will be entrepreneurs and risky investors, and in the second - sponsors with non-commercial motivation.

      <b>Innovative entrepreneurs</b> This is a specific type of businessman, acting as a link between innovators - the authors of the original scientific and applied product - and society, in particular, the areas of production and consumption.  In addition to the usual individual qualities (talent, outlook, imagination, disposition to business risk), such an entrepreneur should have a peculiar form of predicting the viability of a particular scientific and applied product that is presented for development, as a rule, still raw - in the form of an image, idea or, at best, conceptual models, for example, the concept car.  This is foresight in conditions of increased uncertainty. <br><br>  <b>The field of innovation activity</b> It is outlined by the boundaries of concentration of potential objects of application of knowledge and skills at the appropriate hierarchical levels, territories, in certain types of activities.  Potential innovative objects are ‚Äúbottlenecks‚Äù in various open systems (machine, biological, man-machine, socio-technical and others) that function within the framework of ‚Äúsociety - habitat - technology‚Äù.  Implementation of special projects in potential facilities (scientific-industrial-innovative, etc.) ensures the clearance of ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù places by introducing suitable innovations (modernization, innovative, advanced and pioneer).  At the same time, it is important to emphasize that the key prerequisites for organizing a specific project, including the choice of a scheme and amount of funding, are the proposal of innovators to address an applied scientific product and that the interested entrepreneur or manager has an economic and managerial decision on turning this product into a real innovation. <br><br>  <b>Innovative climate</b> This is a kind of ‚Äúnutrient medium‚Äù, which provides a favorable background for the interaction of the factors described above.  Such an environment includes a system of necessary social, legal, economic, informational, and other institutions that support both innovation activities and innovators themselves.  The typical examples of organizational constructions that contribute to the formation of an innovative climate include virtual corporations, technopolises, business incubators, cybernetic information spaces. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57739/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57739/</a></p>
