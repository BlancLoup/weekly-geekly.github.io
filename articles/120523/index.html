At first there were minor, so to speak, troubles with GeoHot, with which a ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù agreement was reached (after which GeoHot called on everyone to boycott Sony products).  Then the PSN and Qriocity servers were hacked.  No sooner had the corporation recovered from this hacking (and still has not recovered), as a successful hacker attack on Sony Online Entertainment followed.  After that, the Sonymusic site suffered as well.  Well, now a group of hackers, which calls itself <a href="http://lulzsecurity.com/">LulzSec</a> , has gained access to <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/">SonyPictures.com</a> servers and data from users of this service.  The data of a million accounts were ‚Äústolen‚Äù, plus 3.5 million coupons of the service were stolen, and 75,000 codes (as I understand it, codes for receiving a discount). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  As already mentioned earlier, the attack was first <a href="https://twitter.com/">announced on Twitter</a> and on the website of this hacker group.  Hackers say they did not copy all the data service.  However, the hackers didn‚Äôt take everything that is bad - they only took databases with data from hundreds of thousands of users.  The databases accessed by hackers contain data such as passwords, user e-mails, date of birth, and other information.  Of course, this is not such a dangerous hacking, as in the case of the PSN, but there are some moments here.

      The most interesting thing about this incident is that the hackers didn‚Äôt use any super modern and super sophisticated methods.  Everything turned out the method of banal and very long known SQL injection.  As it turned out, the Sony Pictures server worked with outdated software that was subject to hacking. <br><br>  In addition, representatives of LulzSec said that Sony stored 1,000,000 passwords in plaintext format, which cannot be called a particularly reliable method of protection, agree.  In fact, we are talking about the negligence of Sony, manifested to the security of data users and their own services. <br><br>  As a result, the corporation is now suffering billions in losses, and what is happening has the most negative effect on Sony‚Äôs reputation, and therefore on the value of its shares.  How do you think, can Sony recover lost ground? <br><br>  PS Looked at the dynamics of the value of the shares of the corporation for several months.  <b>In mid-April, the</b> shares were worth about <b>$ 36 apiece</b> .  Now - <b>26 dollars</b> .  And the fall continues, and very quickly. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/06/02/sony-pictures-hacked/">mashable</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120523/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120523/</a></p>
