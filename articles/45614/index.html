  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How Habr Tested Visual Studio</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the end of September, Habra users <a href="http://gaidar.habrahabr.ru/blog/41526/">gathered</a> at <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/41343/">Microsoft‚Äôs Moscow office</a> to test Visual Studio 2008 and MSDN documentation just translated into Russian.  We‚Äôve been looking for people for this big business from us, who are waiting for a commemorative wristwatch with a logo, about Lomonosov web, web Kholmogory and many other things, we talked with Denis Kotlyarov, head of the developer tools department, and department director Microsoft strategic technology Dmitry Khalin. <br><br>  Gaidar Magdanurov ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/gaidar/" class="user_link">gaidar</a> ), who <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/microsoft/39401/">gathered</a> people at Habr√©, said that only here in one place you can find developers of a very different profile.  And Denis Kotlyarov agrees: ‚ÄúWe received a very good selection of specialists.  Testing participants were randomly chosen by the application, and among them were people of all ages, from many regions (even from Novosibirsk, and in fact all at their own expense), from a wide variety of professional fields ‚Äî web development, internal corporate and development of boxed software. <br><br>  Why precisely Habr?  And we, in fact, did not have much choice - there are no other such large independent IT communities in our country.  This is probably good for Habr, but not so much for the community as a whole. ‚Äù

      The most active participant in the test left 281 comments, although almost all of them concerned spelling and commas.  A gift with a logo for the best contribution received, <a href="http://gaidar.habrahabr.ru/blog/43714/">as you know</a> , not him.  Watches are a separate topic.  Denis says that many want to get them, they offer money for them.  But only those who contributed to the localization and ‚Äúshowed their love‚Äù to Visual Studio receive them.  These are development teams, translators, popularizers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The authors of the pirated localization of Visual Studio, which appeared long before the official one and attracted attention even at the central office of Microsoft, could be included in the list of the latter.  ‚ÄúWe really want to invite them to us for a reward,‚Äù smiles Denis. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://tigger.pp.ru/images/VSwatch_mal.jpg" alt="Memorable hours of Visual Studio at number 1"></a> <br>  In general, the theme of interaction with the community of developers and developers among themselves is ‚Äúthis is sacred,‚Äù says Dmitry Khalin.  And Visual Studio for Microsoft is a product that benefits not from the commercial side, but from the point of view of stimulating the creation of a ‚Äúliving ecosystem‚Äù of IT, which has recently been talked about a lot in the company. <br><br>  ‚ÄúLocalization of Visual Studio is our long-term commitment to the community of professionals,‚Äù says Dmitry.  Reading documentation in your own language is natural and convenient.  For many people, language accessibility can be a basic condition under which they decide to become programmers. <br><br>  Microsoft directs all the money from sales of Visual Studio in Russia to the development of the Russian version.  Thus, if a professional buys a license, the company believes that he is sponsoring the emergence of new young programmers.  "In this," says Dmitry, "there is some kind of social justice." <br><br>  Denis says that when they studied the demand for the Russian version of Visual Studio, they saw heated debates, including on Habr√©.  Someone even collected signatures under the requirement to stop localization.  But ultimately, ‚Äúin real life, many new ideas arise from the study of new technologies, and the more affordable new technologies are, the better for everyone,‚Äù says Dmitry. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNow, when everything is online, it has become easier,‚Äù he continues, ‚ÄúSome kind of web Lomonosov can get the same knowledge as people in Silicon Valley, at the same time ".  And concludes: "Now is the very right time to create new projects." <br><br>  But of course, despite the ability of people from Microsoft to light the verb of the hearts of people and their just conviction that they do the most for enlightenment (‚Äúevangelism‚Äù) in software development in Russia, we should not forget that everyone is free to go his own way.  Just if you are on the way with them, go now, probably easier. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45614/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45614/</a></p>
