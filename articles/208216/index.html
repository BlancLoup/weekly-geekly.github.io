Mars One executive director Bas Landdorp published <a href="http://www.space.com/21813-mars-one-colony-space-radiation.html">an article on Space.com</a> .  Radiation exposure is one of the dangers that accompany the colonization of Mars.  But how big is this risk?  And what is it compared to other risks to which people are exposed?  The article includes details of the description of the protective measures used in the Mars One project and the calculation of the radiation hazard for permanent settlement on Mars. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/825/ff6/896/825ff6896b7e4b2c95ef14a421f5e6b1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Dr. Vladas Lasas joined the <a href="http://www.mars-one.com/about-mars-one/advisers">Mars One Advisory Panel.</a> <br><br>  <b>August</b> <br>  The first update of the roadmap. <br><br>  An independent documentary about the Mars One mission - The Way of the Astronaut has been released. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/jraVEhfFjvY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgCnO5Dz4QcX5Qaqwoqyv-IAgDuCg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  He is accompanied by the stories of candidates Stephen, Sarah, Henry and Beatrice - four inhabitants of the Earth, ready to become the first settlers of Mars.

The first stage of the selection of candidates for astronauts Mars One completed.  During the 5-month period of receiving applications, 202,586 people from 140 countries of the world decided to become the first colonists of Mars.  Before the end of the year, candidates must be notified of the transition to the second qualifying round.  ( <i>More precisely, such a large number most likely relates to users who have registered on the application acceptance portal from candidates, not all of them have applied for real. How many people submitted full-fledged applications ‚Äî the project organizers, unfortunately, do not open it to the general public. - Cholgaa</i> ) <br><br>  Primary selection of applications was conducted by the Mars One Selection Committee, under the direction of Norbert Kraft, Chief Medical Officer.  Mars One Specialist. <br> <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/first-colonists-on-mars-mission-/25090876.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46b/98f/26d/46b98f26dd2f1a5839e2578d523f63f0.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  He has more than 19 years of experience in aerospace research and development.  The main direction of his qualification is the implementation of physiological and psychological measures to counteract the negative effects of a long space flight.  Dr. Kraft won the "NASA Group Achievement Award 2013" - "NASA Prize for Group Achievement in 2013", one of the most prestigious awards with which NASA awards teams who have made significant contributions to the agency's mission. <br><br>  <b>October</b> <br>  The NASA Curiosity Mars Rover determined a relatively high percentage of water content in the near-surface layer of Martian soil. <br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/172511/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/003/e5f/967/003e5f9670a75efb95bc46caeb7d31a5.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Since the Martian colonists will remain on the red planet for an indefinitely long time, it is necessary to have available water in the settlement area.  For this reason, the Martian colony will definitely be based near the site containing the water in the soil. <br>  Extraction of water will be made by life-support modules and will be used for the general needs of the settlement, as well as for the production of oxygen suitable for respiration.  One of the first tasks of the project‚Äôs automatic missions is to find suitable places for a colony-settlement. <br><br>  Two new experts joined <a href="http://www.mars-one.com/about-mars-one/advisers">the project advisory group.</a> <br>  Dr. Peter Mani (Switzerland), a biosafety expert; <br>  Dr. Robert Zubrin (USA), founder and president of the Mars Society. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d5f/752/c00/d5f752c008a5095b6fb3e2eaab31c461.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>November</b> <br>  This month there were two successful missions to Mars!

The prizes include commemorative coins, t-shirts and sweatshirts, twitter and photos sent to Mars and much more.  ( <a href="https://vk.com/marstefo%3Fw%3Dpage-6779754_46306710">translation of a</a> long list of presents in the VKontakte project group). <br><br>  Mars One decided to send a landing module and communications satellite to the red planet in 2018, 2 years after the original schedule.
