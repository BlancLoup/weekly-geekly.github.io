      What will be here and what will not.  In my experience of reading phone reviews, they are 80-90% composed of a description of what is in the box, how the device is in the hand, how the interlocutor is heard, and descriptions of menu items.  I don‚Äôt want to list the obvious, therefore such topics as ergonomics, communication quality, power, installation of applications will not be included in the review.  Anyone can enter the communication salon and evaluate these parameters in less time than is required to read the article.  Phone reviews often complement photos taken from the tester window, from the tester table, and from the tester's bus stop.  These images are low informative, poor lighting, often the lack of composition.  All this often says little about the capabilities of the camera and software.  In my review, I will try to conduct the most objective test of the camera Nokia Lumia 925. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's start with the fact that photography has recently become one of the defining "trump cards" of mobile devices.  Social networks love pictures, and users love social networks.  The simplest, most efficient and attractive way to communicate is to upload ‚Äúphotos‚Äù to all accounts at once from the scene.  The manufacturer goes to meet the consumer, here are dazzling advertising leaflets of phones with multi-layered lenses with autofocus (who can provide manual focus on the phone?), Dozens of megapixels and a bunch of applications that apply the original filters, as well as instantly send photos to the network.  The quality of the photographs obtained by these parameters is not enough.  We will try to select from this noise the grains of really important parameters that can be compared. <br><br>  Nokia has not spared these trends, moreover, this manufacturer places maximum emphasis on the photographic capabilities of its devices.  Of course, the Lumia 925 is not the photographic top of the Lumia 1020, but the statement ‚ÄúHigh definition of photos and videos taken in low light conditions‚Äù is taken from a handout for this model. <br><br>  The question arises: How to objectively assess the quality of the image obtained from the camera?  Size, contrast, spectral range?  Or decide by vote of friends, based on statistics?  I decided to do otherwise.  We push off from the potential commercial value of the photo.  If a phone can make a high-quality photograph, it can be bought, and if it can potentially be bought, then it will be taken for sale, if it is taken for sale, then we can talk about professional use of the phone as a camera.  In turn, the possibility of obtaining income from a photo speaks very well about the possibilities of the camera. <br><br>  As an evaluation criterion tool, I decided to use microstock moderation.  Receivers of wastewaters usually reject any kind of low-quality content (and sometimes quality), but if they see the potential for selling, they take photos.  Of course, I could take some small stock and, by his example, prove the consistency of my statements, but it would be very one-sided, so all the major drains participate in the test (I will give the list with links to their start pages at the end of the article), but for the purity of the experiment, they do not realize that they participate in it. <br><br>  In fact, drains have recently shown an interest in mobile photography.  The following facts allow me to say this: Dreamstime held a mobile photo contest last fall;  123rf and depositphotos have released an application for Iphone, which is used to upload a mobile photo;  depositphotos created a <a href="http://clashot.com/">microstock</a> mobile photo.  Moreover, although this is not discussed anywhere separately, applications are developed only for Apple products, which can indirectly prove that Apple phones can be considered a kind of standardized equivalent of a mobile device capable of creating commercially attractive images. <br><br>  These three runoffs can be attributed to the largest of the existing, therefore, indirectly, it can be argued that there is interest.  And since there is interest, there may be an acceptance. <br><br>  All of the above led me to write a brief technical task for the Nokia Lumia 925 test: <br><br><h4>  Technical task </h4><br><br><ol><li>  To evaluate the technical characteristics of the phone‚Äôs camera from the point of comparison with Apple Iphone 5, other models. </li><li>  Rate the list of available photo software. </li><li>  Shoot various subjects that are most common in stock photography: </li><li>  Raw materials of shooting should be placed on flickr for further publication. </li><li>  Perform photo processing required for placement on drains. </li><li>  Duplicate all captured images onto a Nikon D90 SLR camera, as a publicly available analogue of a digital camera, comparable in price to the Nokia Lumia 925. </li><li>  Download the material obtained with the help of the phone to the microstock, after two weeks, duplicate the material captured with the camera, thereby confirming that the matter is only in the technical parameters, and not in the ‚Äúcurvature‚Äù of the author of the test. </li><li>  Analyze the content of the inspection failures. </li><li>  Make a conclusion about the possibility of using a mobile phone in a commercial photo. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Specifications: </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.nokia.com/ru-ru/phones/phone/lumia925/specifications/">Specifications Nokia Lumia 925</a> - this link describes many parameters of the phone, but we will highlight the main for the test: <br><ol><li>  Main camera sensor size: 8.7 megapixels PureView </li><li>  Camera focus type: Autofocus with a two-step shutter button </li><li>  Lens Carl Zeiss Tessar </li><li>  Sensor Size: 1/3 inch </li><li>  Supported camera f / number: aperture: f / 2.0 </li><li>  Camera focal length: 26 mm </li><li>  Minimum focus range of the camera: 8 cm </li><li>  The format of images created by the camera: JPEG / Exif </li><li>  Flash operating range: 3.0 m </li></ol><br><br>  What we have.  We have a 4.80 √ó 3.60 mm matrix capable of working with an f / 2.0 aperture (fairly high aperture) on a 26 mm wide-angle lens.  All this, unfortunately, can only be registered in Jpeg format.  Matrices of similar size were used in ‚Äúsoap cases‚Äù, for example, in Nikon Coolpix L25, but this is practically the lowest gradation of matrix size.  Optimism is inspired by the comparison of camera phones, available by the link <a href="http://cameraimagesensor.com/size/">Comparison of matrix of digital photo devices</a> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a9/182/011/4a918201189b16350f749e86d0c8bec5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As can be seen from the comparison, the matrix of the Iphone 5 (which we considered above as a certain standard) is, nevertheless, smaller horizontally (it coincides vertically).  On the other hand, the photo-flagship of Nokia Lumia 1020 has a giant matrix for the phone, but for now it's not about him.  Also for comparison, I added the Samsung Galaxy S4 to indicate that not only Apple and Nokia are developing photos in their phones. <br><br>  Summarizing.  Technical characteristics of the camera allow us to make the assumption that the final image can be qualitative.  How true this statement is, the test will show.  I paid special attention to the work of the flash - stock photography is often made with artificial or combined lighting.  An internal flash is unlikely to help in shooting, but is likely to be able to ‚Äúignite‚Äù an external flash.  But at this stage it is only an assumption. <br><br><h4>  Software.  Limitations. </h4><br>  I didn‚Äôt expect from the phone software all the flexibility that full-featured SLR cameras provide.  I wanted to find an application that would allow me to control the shutter speed, change the aperture and sensitivity (ISO), even though it is naive.  Still, because  we only have JPEG at the output, control of white balance was necessary, which, when shooting in raw, I forgot about it at first. <br><br>  Oddly enough, the application was found on the first day.  It's called simply: <a href="http://conversations.nokia.ru/2013/07/nokia-pro-camera-vsya-moshh-professionalnoy-kameryi-dlya-nashih-polzovateley/">Nokia Pro Cam</a> .  Beginning of the article I began to write without having received the device in my hands, which is why there was skepticism about the manual focus of the camera of the phone.  What was my surprise when I realized that the Pro Cam allows: <br><ol><li>  Adjust the white balance (although in the standard settings: cloudy, sunny, incandescent, fluorescent lamps, auto); </li><li>  Manually change the focus; </li><li>  Manually change sensitivity (from 100 to 3200) </li><li>  !!!  Change shutter speed from 4 seconds to 1/16000; </li><li>  Adjust the exposure from -3 to +3 in increments of 1/3. </li><li>  Shoot on self-timer </li><li>  Freely crop and rotate the image </li></ol><br><br>  It was already something that went beyond just clicking.  It is worth noting that Nokia has a few more applications for shooting: <br><ul><li>  Panoramas (standard shots are taken sequentially, and then stitched together); </li><li>  Motion fixation (a series of frames is taken, where the background is captured, and a moving object is shown in the storyboard). </li></ul><br><br>  Nothing of the above, gathered together, I have not met on any platform.  Of course, I changed my mind about changing the aperture (it is constant), but it is quite possible to shoot with a long shutter speed.  What I want to mention separately is cropping.  At the time of my fascination with Instagram, I did not send one or two pictures, simply because I could not correct the horizon, and the applications I found only turned them 90 degrees.  There is also a fly in the ointment - the change in iso, rather, works like ‚Äúmake from a granular one particularly granular‚Äù.  But it's hard to expect another. <br><br>  We turn to the main part of our publication, to the photos. <br><br><h4>  Photo </h4><br><br>  I will present the photos as follows.  First a raw photo taken with a phone, then a photo taken with D90.  Where did this camera come from and why is it participating in the test: Nikon D90, at the moment, an example of a budget DLSR camera, sufficient for working on drains.  Despite the fact that this model is outdated, the camera meets the requirements of wastewater, while at a price comparable to the Lumia 925 (Nikon D90 kit + 50mm f / 1.4G AF-S Nikkor lens in the secondary market will cost about 20 tr. ). <br><br>  <i>Allow a small addition.</i>  <i>I will not begin to place direct links to photographs in stocks in the text, in order to avoid charges of ‚Äúplacing referral links‚Äù.</i>  <i>To confirm acceptance, we will proceed as follows: under each photo taken, I will sign the stock that accepted it, and I will give the key words.</i>  <i>If you doubt that this photo could be taken, you can easily find it in the stock bank.</i>  <i>In addition, all the materials used in the article are available in the set on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devteev/sets/72157635192940961/">flickr account</a> , where they can be viewed in "full size".</i> <br><br><h5>  Part one.  Natural landscape. </h5><br>  For shooting the landscape was selected Silver Bor, where I drove to work.  The morning sun gave quite complex lighting, the whole range of which is not drawn by a professional camera (often such shots are done in HDR).  However, these photos from the phone hit the market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd7/7de/d4b/fd77ded4b435941cd4c493fc981af3dd.jpg" alt="Bottomless lake lumia925"><br>  <a href="">Flickr full image</a> <br>  <b>Name:</b> Morning Silver Forest <br>  <b>Camera:</b> Nokia Lumia 925 <br>  <b>Keywords:</b> bezdonnoe blue sky bridge landscape forest skyline summer moscow nature non-urban ozero parkland pond plant pond recreational relax tranquil tranquil tree water willow <br>  <b>Accepted:</b> Shutterstock, Istockphoto, 123rf, Photodune, Pressfoto, Veer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b88/62e/65f/b8862e65f5396f3e3bb46bc0d06feaa2.jpg" alt="Bottomomless lake nikon d90"><br>  <a href="">Flickr full image</a> <br>  <b>Name:</b> Morning Silver Forest <br>  <b>Camera:</b> Nikon D90 + 50mm f / 1.4G AF-S Nikkor <br>  <b>Keywords:</b> bezdonnoe blue sky bridge landscape forest skyline summer moscow nature non-urban ozero parkland pond plant pond recreational relax tranquil tranquil tree water willow <br>  Approved by <b>:</b> Shutterstock, Dreamstime, Fotolia, Depositphotos, 123RF, Pressfoto <br>  <b>Pending:</b> Veer, BigStock <br><br><h5>  Part two.  Cityscape. </h5><br><br>  Lighting, of course, is a very important moment in the filming of any equipment.  In pictures from the phone, it makes sense to nullify the amount of shadow, since it is such areas that are characterized by strong graininess and noise.  An example of this is a picture of CHP-20, where the lower part of the picture fell into the shadow zone.  Nevertheless, these photos were rated as commercially attractive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c0/164/d7b/8c0164d7b4453afb75f6ea254df407e2.jpg" alt="Thermal Power Station-20 Lumia925"><br>  <a href="">Flickr full image</a> <br>  <b>Name:</b> Thermal Power Station-20.

Therefore, I supplemented this section with just street photography, which I performed on a sunny day on Usachev Street.  Here, the shadow also largely determines the quality of the image.  Shooting with the Nikon D90 was made on the same day, but later in time - there are less shadows on it, the image is more profitable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c64/360/c8f/c64360c8f9fe924ab5a70b623cda0c6a.jpg" alt="Street Usachev Lumia 925"><br>  <a href="">Flickr full image</a> <br>  <b>Title:</b> Usacheva Street in Moscow <br>  <b>Camera:</b> Nokia Lumia 925 <br>  <b>Keywords:</b> architecture beam building business center <br>  <b>Accepted:</b> Shutterstock, Dreamstime, Depositphotos, 123RF <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f8/a06/ab6/2f8a06ab6106362f8b07546f43efac74.jpg" alt="Street Usachev Nikon D90"><br>  <a href="">Flickr full image</a> <br>  <b>Title:</b> Usacheva Street in Moscow <br>  <b>Camera:</b> Nikon D90 + Tokina AT-X 116 Pro DX AF <br>  <b>Keywords:</b> architecture beam building business center <br>  <b>Accepted:</b> Shutterstock, Dreamstime, Depositphotos, 123RF <br>  <b>Pending:</b> BigStock <br><br><h5>  Part Three  Object shooting. </h5><br><br>  In any art school, learning begins with still lifes.  This is the way the educational process is constructed, which is based on the example of subjects that general concepts about the light-shadow model, composition, and color are laid down.  In photography, shooting subjects also plays a significant role, but due to the simplicity of creating a composition (the subject does not move, the author can arrange lights as you like) high demands are placed on subject shooting. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce3/b71/27e/ce3b7127ead4815b07e23d8a9a007687.jpg" alt="Coconut Lumia 925 with internal flash"><br>  <a href="">Flickr full image</a> <br>  <b>Name:</b> Rough hewn coconut.  Shooting with built-in flash <br>  <b>Camera:</b> Nokia Lumia 925 <br><br>  Honestly, after the first tests I wanted to give up this item of the task.  Internal photo flash gave uneven dead lighting.  Aperture equal to 2 did not give a depth of field, and the edges went out of focus. <br><br>  But the test is a test - since I took it, it is necessary to complete it.  What I've done.  I took at work a draft sheet from under the plotter.  Put an object on it (coconut).  I installed a tripod, attaching a softbox frame to it.  Placed the phone so that it is located above the object.  A reflector was located above.  The flash could not be set on fire by the phone, so I was looking for an alternative lighting option. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6f/c90/063/e6fc90063d607195f26e99286924bb72.jpg" alt="Scheme for shooting items phone Lumia 925"><br>  <b>Name:</b> Scheme of shooting items by phone <br>  <b>Camera:</b> Nikon D90 + 50mm f / 1.4G AF-S Nikkor + built-in flash <br><br>  The way out was found to use a longer shutter speed (0.5 sec), a lowered iso = 100, self-timer.  At the time of registration of the image, manually by the radio synchronizer, a flash was launched. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4cd/4a7/29e/4cd4a729e3e57ac7ca24ad14c96685e3.jpg" alt="Coconut with external flash Lumia 925"><br>  <a href="">Flickr full image</a> <br>  <b>Name:</b> Rough hewn coconut <br>  <b>Camera:</b> Nokia Lumia 925 <br>  <b>Keywords:</b> summer, nut break break break break break break break break palm palm palm palm v v vegetarian v vegetarian <br>  Approved by:, 123RF, Photodune, Pressfoto <br>  <b>Pending:</b> BigStock, Veer <br><br>  The resulting image did not add optimism.  At the output, both noise and chromatic aberrations were obtained.  In general, the image is not drawn to the concept of "quality."  Nevertheless, I put a mask on the background, she also removed the luminous edges, applied noise reduction. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ce/483/a0a/5ce483a0a92d1b38c799d1e1a4d875fb.jpg" alt="Coconut with Nikon D90 exterior light"><br>  <a href="">Flickr full image</a> <br>  <b>Name:</b> Rough hewn coconut <br>  <b>Camera:</b> Nikon D90 + 50mm f / 1.4G AF-S Nikkor <br>  <b>Keywords:</b> summer, nutrition beach alcohol beach alcohol alcohol alcohol alcohol alcohol beach palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm palm alcohol alcohol alcohol alcohol alcohol alcohol alcohol alcohol alcohol alcohol alcohol alcohol <br>  Approved by <b>:</b> Shutterstock, Dreamstime, Fotolia, Depositphotos, 123RF, Pressfoto <br>  <b>Pending:</b> BigStock <br><br>  In order not to be limited only to an ‚Äúisolate,‚Äù I also set up an experiment with structural objects that completely fill the frame.  They were shrimp lying on a skillet, next to the window, in the early morning.  After analyzing the experience with artificial lighting, I decided to try to work with natural.  The phone was fixed by analogy with the way I shot a coconut: I installed a soft box frame on a tripod and left the phone with a self-timer in it, after setting the iso 100 and shutter speed 1/8 second.  The result satisfied me.  Still, the phone is set up under natural light, and in this light, the ‚Äúmathematics‚Äù behaves predictably. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/883/ee7/0ac/883ee70ac94e3f7d5df54d6bd3d10649.jpg" alt="Lumia 925 Shrimp"><br>  <a href="">Flickr full image</a> <br>  <b>Name:</b> Shrimp in a pan <br>  <b>Camera:</b> Nokia Lumia 925 <br>  <b>Keywords:</b> cook cuisine dish food grill shrimp <br>  <b>Accepted:</b> Shutterstock, Depositphotos, 123RF, Pressfoto <br>  <b>Pending:</b> BigStock, Dreamstime, Photodune, Veer <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/09a/5b5/686/09a5b568686ebee98681aeaa1ec7b4e4.jpg" alt="NikonD90 shrimp"><br>  <a href="">Flickr full image</a> <br>  <b>Name:</b> Shrimp in a pan <br>  <b>Camera:</b> Nikon D90 + 50mm f / 1.4G AF-S Nikkor <br>  <b>Keywords:</b> cook cuisine dish food grill shrimp <br>  <b>Approved by:</b> Fotolia, Depositphotos, 123RF, Alamy <br>  <b>Pending:</b> BigStock, Shutterstock, Dreamstime, Photodune, Veer <br><br><h5>  Part Four  Reportage. </h5><br><br>  In order to make reportage photos, I needed an event.  Since  The post was written in August-September 2013 in Moscow, the main emerging event was one thing - the city mayoral election.  But bad luck - the candidates traveled around the districts, the location of which I could hardly determine on the map of Moscow, then the weather made me endure the ‚Äúappearance‚Äù.  When there was almost no time left, I accepted the fact that I simply would not have it, and in the rain on September 6 I went to Sakharov Avenue without first taking the main camera (although I am an enthusiast, I try to take care of the technique), having limited myself to a telephone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e36/8ba/c30/e368bac3019dc5db961b2a128ac61361.jpg" alt="Rally Navalny Lumia 925"><br>  <a href="">Flickr full image</a> <br>  <b>Title:</b> Rally in support of a candidate for mayor <br>  <b>Camera:</b> Nokia Lumia 925 <br>  <b>Key words:</b> adherent artists avenue, election campaign, election campaign, protesting, protest rain <br>  <b>Accepted:</b> Shutterstock, Depositphotos, 123RF <br>  <b>Pending:</b> BigStock, Dreamstime <br><br>  By the way, which is characteristic - the microstock 123rf never differed with the speed of verification, but this time it processed the photos in 3 hours.  That says that the subject was claimed and this topic was tracked. <br><br><h5>  Part Five.  Model. </h5><br>  I shot the model in the interior.  By this time, I had already gained experience with the Lumia 925 camera, so I didn‚Äôt have any special illusions.  Since  the model is not a static object, we had to photograph in the light of the room with hands, hoping for automation.  The result was acceptable for social networks, but for stocks, of course, this is not enough.  It is worth noting that increased requirements are made to the model, as well as the subject survey, so at this point I was waiting for the planned failure. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/072/546/240/07254624036bca73ae2a08713a49ca5c.jpg" alt="Model in the interior Lumia 925"><br>  <a href="">Flickr full image</a> <br>  <b>Name:</b> Girl in a cafe <br>  <b>Camera:</b> Nokia Lumia 925 <br>  Keywords: beatifull woman dressing jeans and jeans <br>  <b>Approved:</b> 123RF <br>  <b>Pending:</b> BigStock, Dreamstime, Photodune, Veer <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a0b/d28/35c/a0bd2835c88c4c52e67791e3e9001193.jpg" alt="Model in the interior of the Nikon D90"><br>  <a href="">Flickr full image</a> <br>  <b>Name:</b> Girl in a cafe <br>  <b>Camera:</b> Nikon D90 + 50mm f / 1.4G AF-S Nikkor <br>  <b>Keywords:</b> girl, girl, girl, girl, woman, woman, kneeling, hugging, girl, woman, kneeling, girl <br>  <b>Approved by:</b> Fotolia, Depositphotos, 123RF, Pressfoto, Alamy <br>  <b>Pending:</b> BigStock, Shutterstock, Dreamstime, Photodune, Veer <br><br><h5>  Part six.  Unplanned. </h5><br>  I didn't plan to shoot at night.  Moreover, in the vicinity of the Moscow Metropolis I happened to be by chance, without my camera.  But the success of the acceptance impressed me so much that I decided - we would try and did some reportage shots. <br><br>  It turned out impressively.  I did not expect such an image from the phone.  Apart from debris at the junction of the lanterns and the sky, the image was very decent, and the drains also appreciated it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/49a/4c3/8fe/49a4c38fe44eae3d497839007e667fe2.jpg" alt="Night Metropolis Lumia 925"><br>  <a href="">Flickr full image</a> <br>  <b>Name:</b> Metropolis surroundings.  Moscow <br>  <b>Camera:</b> Nokia Lumia 925 <br>  <b>Keywords:</b> adornment architectural architecture city center city skyline children colourful city center lighthouse street city skyline city street light city landscape metropolis city skyline walk window <br>  <b>Accepted:</b> Shutterstock, Dreamstime, DepositPhotos, 123RF <br><br>  I did not accidentally include this photo in the article.  When I was planning a test, I initially had doubts about its success.  By default, I understood that no matter what characteristics the camera of the phone would have, even before the DLSR camera, it was like the moon.  I, hoping for the best, was fully prepared for the fact that what I had shot would be rejected, and in the worst case, I would also get a couple of letters of happiness with the wording - stop mocking moderators, otherwise we will turn off the light. <br><br>  This did not happen, the acceptance exceeded my expectations, but the main thing happened with this very photo - it was purchased.  Sold it, as expected, ShutterStock, judging by the map (which, however, is less detailed than the pack of ‚ÄúBelomor‚Äù), the photo went somewhere either to Poland, or to Hungary, or Belarus. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee4/019/fa8/ee4019fa8ad3d4c496360558e64d427a.jpg" alt="ShutterStock sale"><br>  <b>Name:</b> ShutterStock Sales Card <br><br><h4>  Analysis of inspection failures. </h4><br><br>  In general, there were much more failures than acceptance.  Some drains generally rejected all the footage.  And, for example, Alamy made it at the level of loading just by the image size.  Fotolia honestly checked and rejected everything by several criteria: defocus, filters, noises.  Other photostocks turned out to be more tolerant, but mostly reportage images were taken - i.e.  not intended for advertising, which can be used to, for example, illustrate the events in the article. <br><br>  There were virtually trouble free drains - for example, Pressfoto accepted everything I sent.  However, if you focus on the flagships, you should understand that artistic photography has quite strict criteria. <br><br>  I also had to face the fact that 1 month for such testing is not quite enough.  Such drains as Istockphotos, Bigstock, Veer, did not complete the verification of the material provided.  On the other hand, Pressfoto (always 1 day), 123RF (1-7 days), Fotolia (3-4 days), DepositPhotos (2-3 days) and ShutterStock (3-5 days) performed better.  It is the percentage of acceptance for these stocks that determined the success of the test performed. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  It is necessary to sum up.  My personal subjective impressions of the phone‚Äôs camera capabilities were very high.  Moreover, I did not expect such a successful result.  I personally made sure that, for example, in some cases it is no longer necessary to drag all the equipment with me for a random frame. <br><br>  Separate words deserve the software Nokia.  I am still delighted with the flexibility that Lumia provides for the user.  Shutter speed, free cropping, manual focus, ISO adjustment is a significant step for phones.  In this review, I didn‚Äôt touch on Nokia‚Äôs ‚Äúfor fun‚Äù applications, but they are worth mentioning: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6d/153/b6b/b6d153b6b4711b3bd4b440702222f892.jpg" alt="Photo fun from Nokia 925"><br>  <a href="">Flickr full image</a> <br>  <b>Title:</b> Children on the swing in the storyboard <br>  <b>Camera:</b> Nokia Lumia 925 <br>  Here, of course, nothing commercial can be, but the combination of people rotating on a swing, looks funny. <br><br>  In total, 8 photos taken with the help of the phone were offered to drains.  Due to the specifics (some stocks do not work with a reportage photo), the volume of the proposed material was 4 photos, which can be sold under an RF license (for Fotolia, Photodune, Pressfoto, Veer, Alamy). <br><br>  Quite a significant part of the photos, at the moment, is in a waiting state.  I did not wait for the end of the audit - its duration is unpredictable, and my post in connection with the latest events of the world market has already begun to lose relevance.  I believe that the already accepted / rejected volume allows conclusions. <br><br>  What conclusions can be drawn?<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The mobile phone matrix, in spite of all installed software, is not capable of registering uniform dark areas, often there are chromatic aberrations in the images, automatic noise levels (and they are, apparently) strongly affect the plasticity of the image. Of course, until recently it was impossible to imagine that the phone could provide a picture as from a DLSR camera, but there is much to strive for. I think the next step would be to register the photo not only in a rather limited jpeg, but also in raw format. That would allow more flexible work with the material. I am sure that these problems exist in the more photographic Lumia 1020, but I expect that with twice as much matrix it can be a truly indispensable reportage tool.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sales took place. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nokia Lumia 925 brought me 25 cents. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, you can confirm the title of my article - Nokia Lumia 925 can be used in photography for income. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For those who missed the link to all graphic materials available on </font></font><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devteev/sets/72157635192940961/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">flickr</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , I post it again. </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">PS Nokia sold its mobile unit when the post was mostly written - I was just waiting for a final check with drains. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I really hope that with the change of ownership, this line of vehicles will not cease to exist.</font></font></i> <br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Final credits: </font></font></h4><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In the test took part (in brackets indicated the accepted number of test photos - a total of 8): </font></font><br><ul><li> <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ShutterStock</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (5) - the flagship in mobile photography. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">High acceptance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sales</font></font></li><li> <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/">Istockphoto</a> (1) ‚Äî   .       . </li><li> <a href="http://www.dreamstime.com/">Dreamstime</a> (3) ‚Äî  .    . </li><li> <a href="http://ru.fotolia.com/">Fotolia</a> (0) ‚Äî  ,   .   . </li><li> <a href="http://www.bigstockphoto.com/">BigStock</a> (0) ‚Äî  , . </li><li> <a href="http://ru.depositphotos.com/">DepositPhotos</a> (6) ‚Äî  ,    (   <a href="http://clashot.com/"></a>  ). </li><li> <a href="http://ru.123rf.com/">123RF</a> (8) ‚Äî  ¬´ ¬ª.
