  <section class="page js-page"><h1>One letter that will replace hundreds of resumes sent</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h6>  We were inspired by the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ohmgrrl/tweak-your-resume/4%3Fsf%3Dkyzben">story of</a> Loren Holliday, who urgently (urgently) had to look for a job and who came up with a great way to do it.  To save your time, let us tell this story briefly and explain why it would also be useful for you to try Lauren‚Äôs strategy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a9/5cc/4fc/5a95cc4fc0d745d0851b8ffb36b005ee.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  "No more unpaid internships!" - snapped father Lauren. <br>  The girl sent hundreds of times her resume, not even the positions that she most definitely could not claim.  And then she was called for an interview at Constant Contact, the company that deals with email marketing.  After returning from the interview, the girl decided to send a follow-up letter with the help of this service, and then it dawned on her that you can also track if you opened the letter, clicked on it - she created her own newsletter iiii ... in 30 minutes she was answered with 15 job offers . 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      So, here's how we advise you to use Lauren's strategy: </h6><br><br>  <b>1. We collect contacts</b> <br><h6>  Make a list of contacts of those who may be useful to you on the way to finding work.  Former colleagues, HR's, the personnel department of the company where I would like to work, friends who can give advice, mail addresses from all the vacancies that are of interest to you ‚Äî you can import data from Facebook or Linked. <br>  Try to collect more than 100 contacts, so that the chances of getting an answer are higher. </h6><br><br>  <b>2. Create a newsletter</b> <br><h6>  So, people are collected.  Now open some service for email marketing.  For example, Mailchimp, which we have already told you. <br><br>  Lauren for the first time called her letter ‚ÄúGet a one-week free trial of Lauren‚Äù :) <br>  A funny letter subject (and not something like ‚ÄúSummary from Valentina Petrushkina‚Äù) will look great and stand out against the background of others.  We came up with examples like this: ‚ÄúEmail marketing specialist in business‚Äù, ‚ÄúI am engaged in PR and branding and this is what I understood‚Äù, ‚ÄúA developer with work experience and a sense of humor‚Äù ... We believe that you will come up with something better yes :) </h6><br><br>  <b>3. We structure the letter</b> <br><h6>  Mailchimp will give you the opportunity to create a newsletter for free and fill it in as far as you want - add bright blocks, links to resumes, portfolios, include a story about yourself, add links to your pages on social networks, and be sure to call to action.  This is important because the addressee must clearly understand - what do you want from him?  Answer?  Let there be a huge button where you can easily be contacted!  It may be worth adding a quote to the letter that is close to you - although it seems to us that it will be appropriate here only in rare cases. <br>  The "cap" of your letter should answer the questions: who are you?  what you need?  and what will you give? <br>  In general, do not tighten, make everything as you like - to the best of strict and creative, and most importantly - informative!  And remember (Lauren suggests): "Done is better, then perfect." </h6><br><br>  <b>4. Decide what we are calling for.</b> <br><h6>  Already discussed that the call to action - the center of your letter.  It must be repeated several times.  And in the letter there should be arguments, facts that will force a person to click and write to you.  They should be evenly distributed so that the letter was read entirely and interested person from beginning to end.  For example, you can make three blocks: <br>  - personal (you need me, because I can / do not forget to back up with information on the actual application of your skills /) <br>  - professional (why companies should consider your candidacy) <br>  - promising (what you can give the company) <br>  Follow all this with links to the portfolio, with clippings from the resume - make sure that there is no doubt about the choice and you want to click ‚Äúreply to the letter!‚Äù (Or whatever you call that button there). </h6><br>  <b>And here are <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/5-voprosov-kotorye-vy-dolzhny-zadat-sebe-pri-otpravke-lyubog/">5 questions that you should ask yourself before sending a letter.</a></b> <br><br><br>  <b>5. Planning the time of dispatch</b> <br><h6>  It is best to schedule a dispatch in the morning, of course.  On a weekday, so that those who just came to work, already woke up and was ready to open the mail at 9-10-11, immediately came across your letter. </h6><br><br>  <b>6. Evaluate the effectiveness</b> <br><h6>  So, as we have said, the peculiarity of the mailing list is that it is then easy to check its effectiveness - whether you looked, clicked, looked at your pages on social networks. <br><br>  If you tried - tell us! <br><br>  And remember that this kind of "mailing" should be applied to those who can afford it.  Creative creativity is different.  That is why representatives of creative professions will certainly appreciate this approach. </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300236/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300236/</a></p>
