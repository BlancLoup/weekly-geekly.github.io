      Data transfer to private companies made almost two thirds of respondents (70%) worry that their personal information could fall into the wrong hands, 64% of respondents were concerned about the violation of their privacy.  Social networks and marketing companies showed the worst results: 75% of consumers stated that they do not trust them at all with regard to the protection of personal data, and only 21% were sure that they could effectively protect consumer data from malicious attacks. <br>  But for some of the respondents, such fears did not matter if they could use the free services provided.  More than half were ready to provide information on their date of birth (53%), marital status (51%) and personal interests (50%);  In Poland, 58% are willing to share information about their spending habits, and half of consumers in Saudi Arabia are ready to provide their mobile number.  At the same time, almost one-fifth (18%) of respondents stated that they are not at all ready to provide their personal data, in the UK the number of such survey participants was 33%.  Consumers in the UK showed the lowest level of willingness to provide their data among all countries in the EMEA region. <br><br>  <b>Trust causes increased demands</b> <br><br>  Although consumers consider banks to be the most reliable companies (76%) and show more confidence in them regarding the protection of their personal data (73%) compared to other sectors of the economy, there is some displeasure regarding the methods used to protect their data.  Consumers believe that banks (77%), medical institutions (71%) and public sector organizations (74%) should introduce more modern identification methods for reliable protection. <br><br>  88% of respondents believe that organizations need to improve their identification systems to ensure security. <br>  There are clear differences in the types of companies that users trust in their data.  Companies with traditional security orientation, including banks, are considered the most reliable.  But it is interesting that we place most of the information on social networks, although we consider them to be the most unreliable.  Regardless of the industry, all consumer-oriented organizations must ensure that their protection systems meet the ever-increasing demands of consumers.  Information about potential risks is becoming increasingly common, so it is even more important to create a security and data protection infrastructure, including technology, training and workflows, which will reliably protect, but not limit the capabilities of consumers. <br><br>  <b>What is more important than user privacy or national security?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  The EU data protection standards recently approved by the European Parliament give citizens the right to file complaints and receive compensation if their information has been misused in the EU.  On the question of what is the misuse of data, 67% said that this is due to the transfer of information to third parties without permission.  Most of this opinion is supported in Poland (71%) and the UK (75%). <br>  In light of the Apple and FBI proceedings on unlocking the company's smartphones, 43% of respondents agree with the statement that high-tech organizations should make national security a priority, not user privacy (31%), and provide government agencies with access to locked devices.  In the UK, 50% said so, in the Benelux - 49%, in Germany - 38% and in Saudi Arabia - 37%. <br>  The responsibility to protect consumers from cyber-terrorism threats is also negotiable.  21% of respondents believe that we should be responsible for protecting ourselves, and 43% believe that it is the responsibility of the state to protect its citizens.  The first answer gives rise to a counter question that more and more consumers are beginning to understand that they play an important role in protecting against external threats, but it is necessary to find a way to share responsibility. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357088/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357088/</a></p>
