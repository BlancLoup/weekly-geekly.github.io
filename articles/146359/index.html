  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ICANN is wrong</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A week has passed since ICANN began accepting applications for top-level domains (TLDs). <br><br>  However, Esther Dyson, founder and chairman of ICANN, argues that there is no need to register new TLDs.  Moreover, there are good reasons for not doing this. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are relatively harmless TLDs.  For example, there is nothing wrong with Google buying .google.  However, if Amazon buys .amazon, it will cause controversy - this name is a rainforest in South America, and .apple can be a whole problem for people who grow, and just love apples.  But put it aside.  If a company owns a trademark with such a name - well, let them buy the corresponding TLD, that's okay.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      But what if someone buys your brand?  Do not worry, ICANN tells us, we took this into account, the owner is determined by the results of the competition among trademark owners. <br><br>  Good.  And if the name is registered by a community of open source software that does not have the financial resources to participate in the competition?  For example, I played some role in the creation and development of blogs.  How can Google get the right to take possession of the value embedded in a text blog?  They do not own it just because they are called Google.  However, they have the full right to become this owner by paying $ 185K to ICANN.  There is no clause in their proposal that promises to pay the creators of an idea that they can simply pick up.  Even if the creators do not want to sell their creation. <br><br>  Now you understand the problem.  And this also applies to those words and concepts that were not created by any of the living.  Sex, love, laughter, children, books, songs, cars, poetry ... These things should not be TLDs.  They are too important, too simple to live.  Not items that any company, shouting loudly, can get into the property. <br><br>  Moreover, it is obvious that this will lead to the creation of much more problems like those that we have with a dead end around software patents.  Companies fighting for our future, who have left us with it, pawns.  We have observed a patent mess for years, but could not hinder it.  This time we can, and must do it. <br><br>  In general, this could be an interesting experiment, worthwhile to bring it to life and find out all the problems that are associated with it.  Thanks to all potential registrars for opening our eyes.  However, the answer must be a positive "no."  The existing TLDs are fine with us.  No gain in link length is worth these changes.  Let's work on solving problems, not create new ones. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146359/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146359/</a></p>
