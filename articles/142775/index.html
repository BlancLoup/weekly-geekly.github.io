As part of Devcup, software developers and designers are invited to come up with and implement interesting applications and services that will allow 25 million Evernote users to expand the capabilities of their accounts.  The prize fund of the competition is more than $ 100,000, and the finalists will get a chance to present their work at the Evernote Trunk Conference event this year in San Francisco. <br><br>  <strong>We have prepared the following prizes:</strong> <br><ul><li>  <strong>Gold</strong> - $ 20,000 </li><li>  <strong>Silver</strong> - $ 15,000 </li><li>  <strong>Bronze</strong> - $ 5,000 </li><li>  <strong>6 finalists</strong> - $ 10,000 each, as well as flights and accommodation for the duration of ETC 2012 </li></ul><br><h3>  What would you like to see? </h3><br>  Successful application combines tempting functionality with a beautiful and intuitive design.  We expect the finals to be used daily by tens of thousands of people, allowing them to preserve and recall important things in their lives.  We can‚Äôt list all the good ideas that we‚Äôve ever heard of, but we‚Äôll try to give a few general topics that will help you with your thoughts on the future project. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.evernote.com/food/">Evernote Food</a> and <a href="http://www.evernote.com/hello/">Evernote Hello</a> are mobile apps that offer users additional Evernote features for use in selected areas of life.  Perhaps you should pay attention to other areas where users would also do well to save information in Evernote in a structured and appropriate manner.  This may be an application with a list of movies that the user wants to see, and notes about what they have already seen.  Such an application could combine information added by the user with data from external resources. </li><li>  Products such as Nike + and Fitbit open up for a large number of people the opportunity to record daily events and achievements in their lives.  These applications generate a lot of information about us.  How to apply Evernote here?  What data from such applications does it make sense to store in Evernote, and how to use the information that Evernote has already accumulated by the user to make such daily entries more meaningful for a person? </li><li>  One of the finalists last year noted that users create two types of notes in Evernote.  Some, such as shopping lists, are initially very important, but lose their value over time.  Others, such as notes from memorable meals, are not very significant in the short term, but become valuable pleasant memories later.  If you divide the world of Evernote notes into these categories, you can think about the orientation of the future application to work with one of these types of notes. </li><li>  Evernote products are used by tens of millions of people around the world.  Only a third of our users live in the USA.  We create products that we believe have universal value and utility, but it is likely that an application that meets the needs of a particular country may seem useful to people.  You may be able to create an application that will be in great demand in your country, and its need is simply not so obvious to a casual observer. </li><li>  Evernote users like to learn more about our products.  Books, blogs and videos that help people start using Evernote or learn new features of the service are very popular.  Only in Japan there were 33 books about Evernote!  Perhaps it would be a good idea to create a guide and a tutorial on Evernote? </li></ul>

      These are just some of the topics on the surface.  Even if you do not plan to take part in the Devcup, we would really like to know which applications you think are necessary.  We are going to talk about this (and the competition in general) in a <strong><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/evernote/blog/141856/">meeting with the developers of Evernote Dev Meetup</a></strong> in Moscow on Friday April 27th. <br><br><h3>  Last year's experience </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1f/896/3de/f1f8963de02b28c041f0d38d177b3742.jpg"><br>  Last year, about 1,000 developers from around the world took part in our competition.  A lot of people were from the USA, about a quarter from Asia, as many from Europe, and there was also a noticeable presence of developers from South and Central America.  All six finalist teams visited ETC and presented their work.  You can view their presentations here - <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/etc">evernote.com/about/etc</a> .  Last year, the top prize went to <a href="http://www.touchanote.com/">Touchanote</a> .  This is an Android application that allows you to link real-world objects with notes in Evernote using NFC tags.  Another application finalist - Notable Meals - formed the basis of Evernote Food.  The third - <a href="http://www.colorstache.com/">Colorstache</a> - allows you to search in Evernote notes on the presence of a given color. <br><br><h3>  Details </h3><br>  Any software that is integrated with the Evernote API can be submitted to participate in the Devcup.  You can develop an application for computer platforms, mobile devices or the Web. <br><br>  <strong>Key dates:</strong> <br><ul><li>  <strong>From today and until June 25</strong> - the formation of the team, ideas, creating an application. </li><li>  <strong>June 25</strong> is the last day for receiving applications. </li><li>  <strong>July 23</strong> - the announcement of 6 finalists. </li><li>  <strong>The end of summer</strong> - the presentation of works-finalists at the Evernote Trunk Conference, the definition of the winner of the Grand Prix and the winners. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/49b/5b3/aee/49b5b3aeeb0fca2c643b5e925f4c7635.png"><br>  As part of the launch of this competition, we have several offline meetings around the world.  You have a great opportunity to discuss the potential and feasibility of an idea with our employees, chat with other developers and learn more about Evernote.  As mentioned above, <strong>in Moscow, Evernote Dev Meetup will be held on Friday, April 27</strong> .  More information about the meeting we wrote <strong><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/evernote/blog/141856/">here</a></strong> .  We also planned to hold webinars, if suddenly you can not attend in person.
