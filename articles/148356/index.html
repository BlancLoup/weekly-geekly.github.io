  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 myths of modern education</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Myth 1. The university should not give a profession - the university should teach the student to learn. </h4><br>  <a href="http://bit.ly/NN1zw6">Higher education is a higher professional education</a> , and its goal is to give a person practical skills and theoretical knowledge to solve problems related to his future professional activity. <br><br>  No wonder, when there is a recruitment of applicants, all universities scream: "Our graduates head banks, factories and work in the most prestigious positions," "we will teach you about this and that, and in general, everything that you may need." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e50/6b3/e01/e506b3e0173f97583980efc9a9c88e13.gif" alt="image"><br>  And on the fifth year a graduate student comes up to the lecturer and says: <br>  - Professor, I go to the red diploma, but I can not find a job. <br>  - The task of the university is to teach a person to study. <br>  - ?? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I wonder if this phrase would have been shouted while recruiting applicants, would the number of people willing to study remain the same? <br><br><h4>  Myth 2. The university learns to learn. </h4><br>  If, indeed, the task of the university is ‚Äúto teach a person to study,‚Äù and the university has been engaged in it for five (!) Years, why is it that it is doing so poorly with its main task?

      Let's see ... <br>  Who in the university learned at least two self-learning methodologies?  No one? <br>  Well, time management is such a very useful thing for work, study, and your whole life. <br>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãreading?  Mind map?  Information memory techniques?  No, have not heard. <br><br>  The Internet, the last achievement of mankind, is able to increase your efficiency by 2-5 times.  What are any 10 ways?  No, classmates and Vkontakte are not considered. <br>  What about the ability to use search engines?  By the way, a very important skill for self-education.  Do you know how to use them, exactly?  Name 5 general search engines and 5 highly specialized in your profession.  There are more than 2000, if that. <br><br>  Resume writing?  Certainly useful to every person.  And this is not taught in high school?  Oh, yes, the university does not prepare professionals.  It seems that the list of items is chosen according to the principle: if it can help a professional activity, delete it! <br><br><h4>  Myth 3. The task of the university to prepare scientists.  If you want to learn a profession - go to vocational school. </h4><br>  "All professions are needed, all professions are important." <br>  <a href="http://bit.ly/OUkm4g">The world needs professionals.</a>  But the degree of knowledge and responsibility of different professions is different.  There are professions that require 3-4 years of study, and there are those for which you need to study for 5 or even 8 years. <br><br>  For example: a surgeon doing heart surgery vs a therapist vs a nurse.  Practicing lawyer vs lawyer assistant vs receptionist.  For a nurse, three years of secondary vocational education are sufficient, but a surgeon, like a lawyer, will have to be taught at a university for five years. <br>  The task of the university is to make a high-class professional out of an applicant. <br><br><h4>  Myth 4. The university should teach everything.  Its very name speaks of this. </h4><br>  University (from the Latin. Universitas - the totality, commonality) - a multidisciplinary institution that is engaged in the training of specialists in many areas. <br>  Those.  The university does not train a specialist in 10 areas, but has 10 different faculties, each of which trains a specialist in one narrow area. <br><br><h4>  Myth 5. Successful people, for the most part, have graduated from prestigious universities. </h4><br>  Many smart and successful people were able to really enroll and graduated from various universities.  Although their success is rather not due to the university, but in spite of.  It is worth digging up the situation deeper and it turns out that the next <a href="http://bit.ly/Oc5XUO">‚Äúsuccessful graduate‚Äù</a> began working in his second year.  And in the university, he was constantly brainwashed and threatened to be deducted for passes. <br><br><h4>  Myth 6. People go to university to gain knowledge. </h4><br>  Why do people even go to college? <br>  I really like the short answer from my overseas friend: "For the sake of good work: to pay for a mortgage and buy food." <br>  On this side of the ocean, many also agree with this statement. <br><br><h4>  Myth 7. All knowledge is useful: learn in high school - it will not be worse. </h4><br>  This is if you choose between ‚Äúhaving studied for six years at a university‚Äù and ‚Äúspent six years in a coma‚Äù.  Six years is a very big price. <br>  If someone offers you an <a href="http://bit.ly/MEkomM">iPad for your kidney</a> , you will not agree?  So why do you agree to "all sorts of knowledge about different things" in the six years of your life? <br>  Six years is a monstrous price.  You are young, active, ambitious.  Ready to learn the world and show him what they can. <br><br>  For 6 years it is possible to turn from a schoolboy who is fond of programming into a high-class professional.  Work abroad, see the world, start a business.  I know people who started making websites at 17, and at 24 they already have their own firm, house and car. <br>  Do not lie to yourself: a university is such a quiet place where you can pull a strap and convince yourself that you are growing above yourself without leaving your comfort zone. <br><br><h4>  Myth 8. I would not trade my student time for anything. </h4><br>  And for an internship at Apple? <br>  Some lectures are much more boring than any work.  And in order to communicate with peers and solve interesting problems, it is not necessary to go to a ‚Äúspecial place‚Äù for five years. <br>  Work in a real company, people from whom you can learn, and next, are the same as you, yesterday's schoolchildren with burning eyes.  Who would have refused to be staged for five years in a large international company, instead of studying at a university? <br><br><h4>  Myth 9. The average level of intelligence among those who have not studied at the university is lower than that of graduates. </h4><br>  There is undoubtedly a correlation between intelligence and higher education.  But what is the cause and what the consequence is another matter.  It seems to me that the university is not the cause of a great mind, but vice versa: the smarter a person is, the greater the chance that he will go to university ‚Äúbecause he can, and everyone does that‚Äù (c). <br><br><h4>  Myth 10. The advantage of the university is that it develops brains. </h4><br>  Good interesting work develops the brain is not worse.  Any intellectual effort does this.  A smart person will always find what he learns from life.  Here, rather, the role is played by the desire to learn, and not the place of study. <br><br>  You have been working for five years and you know everything?  There is Wikipedia, professional forums, smart books and readers.  Self-education is interesting and not difficult. <br><br><h4>  Myth 11. Who knows how - goes to work, who does not know how - teaches. </h4><br>  This article is only 10 myths. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148356/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148356/</a></p>
