  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Renee James and Brian Krzanich - new "first persons" of Intel</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ad/2a7/e9a/0ad2a7e9a87b9559668451cfa6b321da.jpg"><br><br>  At the beginning of May, while we were enjoying spring holidays, significant changes in management took place at Intel: it was officially announced that Brian Krzanich would take the place of Chief Executive Officer on May 16, and Ren√© James would become President of Intel. (Renee James).  Krzananich previously held the position of Intel‚Äôs Chief Operating Officer (Chief Operating Officer), while James was responsible for software development at the company.  Information about appointments quickly swept through all the world news portals, even far from business topics - for example, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/02/intel-names-brian-krzanich-as-new-ceo/">Engadget</a> .  What is so important about it? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The answer, meanwhile, is simple.  In the IT industry (as in any other), there are literally several leadership positions, in which people are able to individually influence its development.  The man at the helm of such a giant as Intel, of course, belongs to this category.  Intel's recent history, its successes and failures, is inextricably linked with Paul Otellini - both CEO and President of the company since 2005.  During this time, there were so many important events that you should not even try to list them.  Note the main thing: Intel, headed by Otellini, managed to maintain a dominant position in the field of x86 solutions.  However, the problems that the new leadership will have to solve are also abound. <br><br>  Brian Krzanichy comes to the new post (formally it will happen on May 16) at a time when companies, more than ever, need strategically correct decisions.  The situation in the world of digital technology is changing in a bizarre, not completely understandable even to the most perspicacious experts.  In the appointment of an engineering career that has made Krzananiƒá, analysts see a desire to strengthen Intel‚Äôs production potential, including through its diversification, penetration into new markets, primarily mobile and ultra mobile.

      Promoting the head ‚Äúfrom the inside‚Äù Intel (at that time, as many expected the appointment of a person from the outside) means, above all, continuity in management decisions and the absence of abrupt movements.  No one doubts that the company will remain under the banner of x86 architecture, accelerating its expansion by all possible means.  It is noteworthy that the new director starts his activity simultaneously with the new Intel Haswell processor: ‚Äúthe era of Krzanich,‚Äù if that happens after the ‚Äúera of Otellini,‚Äù starts with an inevitable positive.  But the future of other products coming along with the next Intel Core (Bay Trail, Merrifield, Brickland, Avoton) is less predictable, and this, I think, will be the first ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù to Krzanich. <br><br>  Ren√© James over the years led the development of Intel software products, and was also responsible for interaction with subsidiaries.  It was under her leadership that such well-known companies as McAfee and Wind River joined Intel.  The professional community Rene is well known for its numerous speeches at various conferences and forums.  Experience in negotiating and participating in public events, of course, it will be useful to her in a new post. <br><br>  So, the challenges facing the new leadership of Intel, we know about.  But the ways to solve them, which will offer the team Krzanicha-James, we learn, and something in the very near future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178893/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178893/</a></p>
