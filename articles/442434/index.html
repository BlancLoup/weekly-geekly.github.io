      It looks somehow complicated.  Let us analyze what you can apply to your site. <br><br>  Here are 7 recommendations that you can apply right now. <br><br>  <b>1. Traffic that goes NOT from a search engine is very important</b> <br><blockquote>  If attendance affects the ranking, we can expect that search engine is important traffic that is not associated with the search - the one that is not affected by either the search engine itself or its competitors.  (p. 21) </blockquote>  a) No page in VK, FB or INST?  Create.  Place your logo, description and let it be ranked.  If possible, lay out 1-2 news per week. <br><br>  b) Thought about email distribution?  Be sure to put in a letter a link to the site, it is desirable that it be clicked. <br><br>  c) Big state?  Let each employee bookmark the site.  It is not necessary to wind up transitions artificially.  But judging by the research, go to the site better from the bookmarks. <br><br>  d) Obviously - we write the name of the site on business cards and other printed materials. <br><cut></cut><br>  <b>2. Be clear on your positioning: a commercial or informational site?</b> <br><blockquote>  It is rather difficult to confirm this with numbers in hands, but ‚Äúinformational content‚Äù is a crucial factor: a page that does not match the query for this parameter simply does not fall into the search results.  Moreover, for information requests, many factors that improve the ranking of commercial requests, start to work in the opposite direction and pull the site to the bottom.  (p. 27) </blockquote>  If it is a category / product card, the text should <b>help the person to make a purchase.</b>  Specifications, price, alternatives.  This is what should be on a commercial page. <br><br>  If we have a review of the goods - we must <b>help the person to choose the goods.</b>  Here you can open the topic completely.  Historical background on whether to overpay for power / brand / design, recommendations of opinion leaders, etc.  Well, you yourself have not just watched what a review of goods. <br><br>  <b>3. httpS - affects the ranking</b> <br><blockquote>  If you haven‚Äôt switched to https yet, the fact that it can be useful for search promotion will help you to come to terms with the need for this step.  (p. 35) </blockquote><br>  Put the SSL certificate.  The simplest if you have beget.ru.  There is free and in 1 click.  If the hosting is different - write in support of "I want to put an SSL certificate."  Often it is paid.  To get started, put the easiest / cheapest.  If the site is large (500+ pages) - there is a risk of losing positions.  Check with SEOs about how best to move to https. <br><br>  <b>4. Buy links.</b>  <b>Wisely</b> <br><blockquote>  In Yandex, ‚Äúcorrupt links‚Äù are not exactly ignored, but ‚Äúwhites‚Äù work better.  And Google is all the same.  (p. 70) </blockquote>  Decipher.  "With the mind" - this means you need a minimum: <br><br>  a) Explore the site with your own eyes.  Look at the last 2-3 articles, are there links to third-party sites?  If yes - this is a minus.  Says that the webmaster agrees to each offer, and the content for the development of the site has ceased to write. <br><br>  b) Whether the site is registered on the reference exchanges.  You can check through checktrust.ru.  If these are exchanges of the type SAPE-wizard (seo hummer, seopult, megaindex), in short lease references - we immediately hammer to the site. <br><br>  If exchanges with eternal links, such as gogetlinks, miralinks - we look at the site with our eyes, all as in paragraph a. <br><br>  c) The cost of the link must be at least 500 rub.  If the webmaster sells links for less money - he maximizes the profit from the dying site (most often). <br><br>  By the way, there is no clear concept "White link".  Ideally, this should be a link from grateful users to other resources.  But will there be a ‚Äúgray‚Äù or even ‚Äúblack‚Äù link from lenta.ru or rbk.ru purchased for 70000r?  Of course not. <br><br>  Define a white or gray link asking the question: ‚ÄúWould I like this site to have a link to my resource?‚Äù.  Do not consider the cost.  If the answer is "yes" - the link is white. <br><cut></cut><br>  <b>5. Post a video</b> <br><blockquote>  For video on the site for the second year in a row continues to grow rapidly.  In Yandex, there is a strong correlation with the position - but Google is still stronger: the values ‚Äã‚Äãare higher, and there is a strong connection with getting to the top (p. 58) </blockquote>  Any video content has a good effect on the ranking.  Product overview, unpacking, treatment of the gene.  directors, holiday greetings, etc. <br><br>  Moreover, the video quality is only 30% of the profit.  For example, you can shoot a video on a mobile phone, showing your small production workshop and that will be enough.  Or you can order a high-quality corporate film - squeeze all 100% of the good, but spend more money.  If you do not remove anything - well, here you understand. <br><br>  Sometimes a simple video on the phone with your comments is clearer than a cool movie about the company.  More vital is something ... <br><br>  <b>6. Post reference materials and FAQs.</b> <br><blockquote>  But reference materials and answers to questions are on the rise: all values ‚Äã‚Äãgrow, in both search engines there is a connection with getting to the top, and correlation with the position, the average values ‚Äã‚Äãof both parameters in the top 30 search engines have crossed the milestone of one third of sites, and in the top 3 - matched to half.  (p. 59) </blockquote>  Obvious advantages: <br><br>  a) The impact on optimization of the whole is a significant search factor; <br><br>  b) Expansion of semantics.  For example, in one case I mentioned the service ‚ÄúInterruption of hard drinking‚Äù. <br><br>  Usually they are looking for her on demand ‚Äúwithdrawal from binge drinking at home‚Äù.  But there are other word forms.  Including not at all popular, jargon: ‚Äúprocapka‚Äù, ‚Äúprokapatsya‚Äù, ‚Äúdetoxification‚Äù, ‚Äúdropper on the house‚Äù.  Such queries are perfect for the FAQ.  Sometimes they are used in the comments to the services. <br><br>  <b>7. A couple of words about the lyrics.</b> <br><blockquote>  The strongest parameters are those that are as far as possible from the exact request. <br><br><ul><li>  Do not require the words of the request to meet together; </li><li>  they do not require their order to be the same as in the request; </li><li>  do not fix the form of words; </li><li>  allow you to replace words with their synonyms.  (p. 74) </li></ul></blockquote><br>  But it is not exactly.  In the top most sites with spammed texts.  Obviously, the concept of "SEO text" is coming to naught.  But the keys still do not forget.  Use common sense.  Insert the keys, but do not pinch.  Common sense + readability&gt; exact occurrence of queries.  Use the wordstat.yandex service, and if it‚Äôs not enough, then the key collector. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a3/bcf/b83/8a3bcfb834331624a0feeb84765edfea.jpg" alt="image" width="350"></div><br>  <i>In the photo I (Dmitry Dyadyukov, Commercial Director of TopTop) and Alexander Lyustik (the creator of Key Collector), who in 5 minutes of communication made an impression of a cheerful and kind person.</i> <br><br>  Hopefully it was helpful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442434/">https://habr.com/ru/post/442434/</a></p>
