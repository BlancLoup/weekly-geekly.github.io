These were hot years, we entertained you as best we could, and, we believe, earned the right to an article dedicated to our loved ones.  The material is supposed to be readable by young and not very applicants, customers in search of an IT contractor, who want to learn the details of our processes in detail, and just for anyone interested in the development of IT companies in one small silicone taiga (since we are typical for its segment, an inquisitive reader will draw many interesting conclusions for themselves). <br>  There are several dozens of IT companies in the Novosibirsk Academgorodok.  Among them are giants such as CFT and 2GIS, there are small offshore desks with a dozen people, and there is a strong middle of rapidly developing companies with a staff of 50-100 people, including us.  In order not to produce many letters, we will not make a big digest into the history of Academ and its IT companies, but let's say that <a href="http://sib.fm/columns/2013/11/12/akademovskaja-ajtota">an</a> employee of EastBanc Technologies is amusingly discussing the peculiarities of academic IT parties. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10d/5e6/b82/10d5e6b826774e3cb05f60459280c7a3.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Immediately we warn you: in the article we try to be as frank as possible, but we will not talk about wages, this is the policy of our institution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e01/0cb/0f9/e010cb0f975f4d5c8924ec3ce2da90dc.jpg"><br><br>  <b>How are we similar to other IT companies Akademgorodok</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  <b>We are dominated by graduates of the golden trio of Novosibirsk universities, which train programmers.</b>  <b>NGU, NGTU and SIBSUTI - we and not only hold on to them.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ea/376/aed/6ea376aedc2c41688dc709e5902556f4.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Comfortably organized space.</b> <br>  The features of our interior do not allow us to unfold to the extent of Google, but we have scooters, but what else is needed? :) The whole company is, in fact, a long corridor in which there are sofas and benches, there are a couple of boards, you can collect spontaneous meetings.  There is also a kitchen, sports equipment, and a meeting, in general, we are not in distress, and we are winning over new land from the landlord. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aee/5d6/fb4/aee5d6fb42ed4bc9a42e369449ed09fa.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/afa/532/21b/afa53221bfad41b5be81c0a8d69e654e.png"><br><br>  <b>Free schedule and homely atmosphere.</b> <br>  We do not welcome the phenomenon of work closer to dinner, but at around 11 am you can adjust your schedule.  This, of course, is not a chatter of revelry, which occurs in many companies, when you can come at three in the afternoon, but people are comfortable. <br><br>  <b>Free subscription to the gym and swimming pool.</b> <br>  Employees of the company attend fitness for free, their relatives and friends for a symbolic price.  And we also have our own corporate lanes in the pool, on which only Eastbank programming sharks proudly swim three times a week. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c39/ae7/060/c39ae706012d40b18c0c1ccc535488fe.png"><br><br>  <b>We take students for 20 hours a week.</b> <br>  You can join us at the 4th year.  Students are treated with understanding, students are allowed to take exams, they are taught to work.  There are experienced mentors who have cultivated more than one beautiful swan. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/abf/808/1db/abf8081db2b74b30b97dd1eb2ca29bc9.png"><br><br><h5>  <b>How are we different from other IT companies Akademgorodok</b> </h5><br><br>  <b>Information.</b> <br>  Many IT companies have good intentions to build open relationships with their employees through timely coverage of news, events, tactics and company strategies.  The company's management suggests that this will have a beneficial effect on people's motivation, inspire, calm in a difficult time, give determination and strength to develop, etc.  The calculation is correct, this is how it should work - information helps build and live.  But not everyone manages to build, consolidate and keep afloat their information ship: a couple of corporate newspapers are issued, news is written on the portal for three months, then everything bothers everyone and silence comes again. <br>  We already have two years of experience in systematically informing employees and it rests on three pillars - tradition, simplicity and corkboard.  In the rain, heat, blizzard, every Monday at exactly 9 am a fresh news report appears in the kitchen with all the news of the past week: new colleagues, dismissals, project stages, corporate photo reports, congratulations on weddings and births - everything is covered where nailed a new flower shelf.  Every Monday.  Exactly at 9 am.  Since 2012.  About trivia and sensations.  This tradition never stops, no matter what happens. <br>  Why do we typeset news in the Word, print it on a color printer and pin pins to a simple corkboard?  Why we do not buy the plasma in the entire wall and do not twist the news there, or do not send them by mail, or do not print the circulation of the newspaper, or do not post on the corporate portal?  First, ‚Äúnot in the pies of happiness,‚Äù information is still on what to be printed, just to be.  Secondly, in our opinion, to come to work on Monday morning, pour some coffee in the kitchen and start working week with fresh news, stand up on feet, right there at the blackboard discuss with your colleagues what is written - a terribly warm tube tradition, such moments are necessary to Break away from the monitor and immerse yourself in the good old offline. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/833/232/5f1/8332325f13dc4554aebee385bfaeae1b.png"><br><br>  <b>Diversified portfolio of projects.</b> <br>  Now we open about 41 different projects.  Most of them relate to our profile and represent either the creation of a certain corporate information system, or some of its modules or services.  Many developers, especially young ones, consider this kind of work prosaic.  Maybe someday we will write an article devoted to the poetry of enterprise-level systems and will convince everyone. <br>  But often we have projects that seem boring to anyone.  For example, write an algorithm for image recognition.  Or to track the movement of public transport.  Many in our portfolio of custom development, both mobile and web.  Such diversification not only creates a pleasant diversity in professional life, but also protects against surprises and crises. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de1/482/af3/de1482af372b41f5bad2006c3bca381e.png"><br><br>  <b>Teach colleagues and learn from colleagues.</b> <br>  Practically any pedagogical initiatives are widely welcomed and supported: the management is always ‚Äúin favor‚Äù, ready to provide the necessary premises and equipment.  Any internal corporate seminar gathers an average of 15 student colleagues.  Interestingly, the company does not pay for the time that employees spend as teachers and students, and this does not affect attendance or the number of people willing to conduct seminars.  Full house always. <br>  The distance learning format is also popular: a Microsoft Azure specialist can announce that he is ready to accept students, provide them with theoretical materials and his own help in their development, as well as a project for practical actions (as a rule, these are some intra-company tasks, related to corporate site and other systems).  Participation is also voluntary and not paid for with money - only knowledge and experience.  For all the time the existence of this practice, only 1 (one) employee expressed his ‚Äúphi‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/57f/518/e7b/57f518e7b0774287a348f12b94a4db47.png"><br><br>  <b>The company invests in employee development.</b> <br>  As gifts for the New Year, our employees receive certificates for training: this year, four designers and developers went to study at the British Higher School of Design, department heads received a paid one-year MBA course at the LINK International Business School, 16 developers were certified by Microsoft. <br><br>  <b>We have processes, the project office is managed.</b> <br>  In many medium-sized companies, the ‚Äúhereditary chaos‚Äù that they have acquired in the future by small companies remains.  We solved this problem a long time ago and we work in an adult way.  Yes, it hurts, yes, it is hard, yes, filling in the timeshields is a rare epic, but in the end, everyone is better off.  Managers of the project office constantly prepare analytical reports, which provides additional tone to all project participants and allows them to work as efficiently as possible. <br><br>  <b>We are constantly working on our Microsoft competencies.</b> <br>  EastBanc Technologies is the official partner of Microsoft in Russia.  At the moment, we have confirmed our coolness in four areas - Data Analytics, Application Development, Collaboration &amp; Content, Cloud Platform.  In addition, we participate in all marketing activities of our partner, and in 2014 we even became the best Russian Windows 8 developers and represented Novosibirsk at a partner conference in Washington.  This year we will fight for a global victory. <br><br>  <b>Our experience and experts are in demand at industry events.</b> <br>  For the soul of EastBanc Technologies - dozens of implemented non-trivial projects that were not only successfully launched, but for many years working in organizations around the world.  Among them, mobile applications for the media, corporate services, CRM-systems, project management systems, cases of which are of interest to the professional community.  Due to this, every autumn we speak at several metropolitan and local events, where we share our experiences. <br><br>  <b>You can participate in marketing activities.</b> <br>  To write articles on Habr, speak at conferences and exhibitions, develop new products and offers, be realized as a public person at events in which EastBanc Technologies participates. <br><br>  <b>We have developed corporate identity tools.</b> <br>  We are jealous of how the company looks outside and what kind of message our marketing materials carry.  Speakers at events are always provided with all the necessary weapons, starting with business cards and ending with corporate souvenirs, so we don‚Äôt beat the dirt, we remember our customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c1/9d6/692/9c19d66922e74b56a992f3477649ee9c.png"><br><br>  <b>Corporate tasteful.</b> <br>  In EastBanc Technologies, everyone, including the directorate, loves how to go and do it at every opportunity.  Almost every Friday we fry kebabs, or we play on the table, or we are just going to chat over a cup of mulled wine.  All the reasons to take a walk - March 8, February 23, Valentine's Day and others - we use to the fullest.  We start cooking New Year's corporate party in August, and a big summer picnic - in March.  Our colleagues are great lovers to dress up and dance, and the company gladly encourages these qualities in them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e0/6e7/4e2/2e06e74e2fd84861aa0e95bbb29bff2e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/acd/0e8/95f/acd0e895f17245c99d23a8d29dede0d3.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Honor the family institution.</b> <br>  For the employees' children, there is a ‚Äúcorporate party‚Äù, more precisely, a New Year's matinee, where everyone is honored - and Santa Claus is there, and a wagon of gifts, and lots of entertainment, master classes and competitions.  It can be said, the children's holiday is the most important and all holidays of EastBanc Technologies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/016/d8c/947/016d8c94795b44bba3881108380b561f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>We are guided by simple philosophy: you need to work for quality and do only such things that you can be proud of.</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  <b>Blog in our life</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  For many years, EastBanc Technologies has lived without any ‚Äútheoretical basis‚Äù.  She lived well, I must say, no one was hampered by the absence of a mission and a formulated strategic goal.  But, characteristically, it did not help: the first years of its existence the company was in blissful anabiosis, 25 people of the staff who worked on several projects for the United States rotated somehow, nothing new happened from year to year and did not develop anywhere. <br>  We still do not have a formulated mission to this day. We are still not so enthusiastic about corporate games, but the development vector is known for sure - we are striving to be the first in the Russian market to develop corporate IT systems. conditions such that people do not want to leave us.  Many IT companies think that it‚Äôs enough to buy a couple of scooters and scribble bean chairs across the corridor, others say that only money motivates the staff.  We think that it is necessary to do cool information systems with which millions of users will work for many years, continuously develop as professionals, keep their word - and people will reach out to you.  Our experience can be trusted, EastBanc Technologies honestly went through all the stages of the path from a small to a strong medium-sized company with a really working project office and streamlined processes, but at the same time it retained warmth and humanity. <br>  The blog on Habr√© for two years has become an important stage on the way to our goals.  Everybody wrote it: developers of .NET, Java, mobile department, QA-department, designers, directorate and marketing.  Sometimes they injected, cried, but continued.  With bated breath watched ratings.  Received a lot of good and bad reviews.  Received many responses and questions on corporate mail.  We plan to continue in the same vein and advise everyone: blogging perfectly unites the team. <br><br>  <b>The results of two years</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  From February 6, 2013 to February 6, 2015, we published 43 (today's - 44th) articles, including: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Our best post: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eastbanctech/blog/212321/">About data openness in Android applications</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Our worst post: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eastbanctech/blog/210172/">MS Surface vs iPad Air: what is preferable to write mobile applications for the corporate segment?</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Views leader: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eastbanctech/blog/192998/">Responsive Android application or 1001 ways to upload a picture</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Most comments: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eastbanctech/blog/214033/">Cross-platform development on Titanium - is it a terrible end or horror without end?</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ The most popular non-mobile post: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eastbanctech/blog/232229/">React JS injection into the application on Angular JS or the struggle for performance</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Leader of responses outside of Habr: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eastbanctech/blog/195110/">Reservation of meeting rooms - integration of SharePoint 2010 with Exchange 2010</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e12/103/9c7/e121039c78e64e45a0e4d7d3dd1d5ef3.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/249859/">https://habr.com/ru/post/249859/</a></p>
