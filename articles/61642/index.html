  <section class="page js-page"><h1>the fate of a small developer in a large company, or is it necessary to fight windmills</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  First optional preface.  For this topic I received an invite to habr (thanks to <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/ecl/" class="user_link">ecl</a> ).  I was not going to publish it, but yesterday the story got an unexpected continuation, so I could not resist. <br>  The tale is simple. <br><br>  I started working in a small office (15-20 people), which was the only development point of a small Canadian company.  There I learned what XP is, Scrum, independent decision making and, in general, freedom.  Well, then I did not understand this, I thought that Scrum was bullshit, but for the rest I thought so everywhere. <br>  After working a year and a half for student zp, I decided that I was worth more. <br><br>  Easily settled into a large office, which was one of the many points of development of the huge western <br>  the company. <br>  The system of payment in this office deserves a separate mention: you sit, doing nothing (without a project) - get sn.  In the project - get another bonus (once a quarter - another sn). <br>  If you don‚Äôt participate in the project - if you want - pick your nose, if you want to participate in the development of the internal intranet.

      <br>
      From the first days I found myself in this <s>gov</s> intranet.  In my inexperienced view, the system was designed crookedly, implemented accordingly, only worse.  I went to the man who was responsible for "this". <br><br>  -Why like that?  So conceived?  - I asked. <br>  -No - they say, just like that, imperfection. <br>  - Why so?  - the same answer <br>  etc. <br>  Why a project under CVS, and not under SVN, say?  After all, CVS is the day before yesterday! <br>  -Admins can not configure the SVN repository.  (the project was already 1.5 years old) <br><br>  The next shock was waiting for me in the project. <br>  Bureaucracy‚Ä¶ <br>  I could stupidly sit without work for a week, because on the side of the head company I didn‚Äôt have any accounts for a week.  And nobody cared.  Neither customers, nor my manager. <br>  The project, designed for 3 months, changed its tasks in a coordinated way one month before the end - and everyone ran like sweaty mice. <br>  - well, <s>pi</s> in general!  - I thought. <br>  As a result, at the end of the project a donut turned out without a hole, and we received an award !!! <br>  Well, well - I thought - maybe an exception. <br><br>  And I spent 4 months without a project. <br><br>  Since I really didn‚Äôt want to participate in the development of an intranet, I went to the top managers. <br>  Let's - I say - let's make such an internal project, we have 10 people without a project.  New interesting technologies - not EJB2, but RESTful, JavaFX, Groovy.  I am told: <br>  - Dude, you're cool, come on! <br>  But then another blow was waiting for me - none of the 10 people wanted to do something.  Here is an exemplary conversation with each of them: <br><br>  - What for?  Will I get an award? <br>  - Not. <br>  -And sense? <br>  -Prof growth. <br>  - No, thanks, I'll be waiting for the project. <br><br>  The heads, having learned about it, only shrugged their shoulders: <br>  - Dude, you're cool. <br>  and continued to do their archival affairs. <br><br>  And I started my project alone. <br>  A month later, I had one person in the project.  in another week - two ... <br>  ... and then they took me to the project.  and the internal project was bent at once, both assistants returned to doing nothing. <br><br>  Why am I all this? <br>  Take the abstract-average programmer. <br>  Here everyone says - first of all, he should enjoy his work, money - they are second in motivation. <br>  And what happens?  - he is pleased.  The project is interesting - good.  not interesting - nothing.  no project - ok.  Money is paid. <br>  Those.  dear habra users when they talk about motivation, they talk about their motivation, and not the average programmer, say. <br>  And he wants money. <br>  And stability. <br>  And stability in the first place, even if it is stability with little money.  The average programmer will not go to another office if he is offered 20% more sn.  and certainly not going to the same or lower wages, but for an interesting job. <br>  And it will remain the average programmer. <br>  But with a great desire, you can bring it up.  own example.  Is it worth it - another question. <br><br>  I want to note that I am not trying to convey the idea: ‚Äúall people are like people, and I am Jimi Hendrix‚Äù.  I still work in this office.  and you know why? <br>  Because it is a swamp - delays. <br>  Because it‚Äôs better that it‚Äôs completely without work, the realities are now completely different than a year ago, and it‚Äôs not so easy for a young programmer to find a job. <br><br>  I am trying to understand the average programmer, because understanding him will, I feel, will be very useful to me in the future, as you hope ... <br>  But they are different. <br><br>  PS How it all ended - I will write in a week, I will not say ‚Äúgop‚Äù until I jump. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61642/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61642/</a></p>
