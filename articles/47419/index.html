Post quite voluminous, and its essence can be summarized more briefly.  But it was written that way. <br><br>  The characteristics of my desktop computer began to disagree me.  Not that globally - but in something they began to be missed.  And after the appearance of the 24 inch IDEA monitor, it became slower to work, and when assembling the project, the microsoft mouse the wireless mouse began to twitch and in general the fact that the project was going to a friend five times faster is eating :). <br>  However, considering that this is a P4 3 GHz HT, 1G Ram, GT 6600 - not surprising.  If you exclude the video card content of the computer for more than five years.  It would be necessary to something quickly.  Basically the processor, well, the memory is clear more.  But without fanaticism.  A working computer which would be enough for another three years. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Secondly, there was still to realize his long-standing desire and make a casual game.  Under that, the <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> engine was selected, which currently has an editor only for Mac OS, although by the end of 2008 they promised to release a version for windows. <br>  But most importantly, it also allows you to release games under the Mac axis and under the iPhone, which is very close to me as a developer of mobile games.  Therefore, there was also a desire to get hold of a Mac. <br>  And thirdly, I would like to collect a little noisy system, so that you can spend the night <br>  sometimes leave enabled. <br><br>  Under all given parameters ideally suited Mac Mini.  The price of 1000 US dollars for <br>  The version with the expanded memory and the increased disk suited me.  The price was true with the USA, but I managed to find a friend who could bring him to me.  One thing confused - the impossibility of reviews to connect a 30 inch monitor with a resolution of 2560x1600 to it (who has experience, please share?).  And the thirty was in my plans for the future. <br>  But then there was an opportunity to sell my Acer Aspire 9303wsmi laptop for 20k rubles. <br>  Having estimated that 1k dollars plus 20k rubles is actually the cost of a MacBook Pro on Ebay, I decided to consider this option.  For the speed of my Acer did not suit me either, and the MacBook Pro as a desktop computer was suitable for the wave.  Therefore, I decided to consider this option.  EBay also arranged for me because I had the opportunity to ask a friend to bring a computer from the USA to Russia.  Those.  All I needed was delivery to an address in the USA. <br><br>  EBay tracking yielded the following results. <br><br>  MacBook Pro 17, 2.16 GHz, 2 GB, 1680 by 1050, 120 GB went on average about 900-1000 dollars. <br>  MacBook 17, Pro 2.3 - 2.4 GHz, 4 GB, 1680 by 1050, 160-200 GB left on average about 1400-1700 dollars. <br>  MacBook 17, Pro 2.4-2.5 GHz, 1920 to 1200, 200 + GB went on average for 1800-2200 dollars. <br><br>  My maximum budget was 1800 dollars.  I really wanted the screen 1920 to 1200 - because there are a number of applications in which I have a critical high resolution.  I participated in a number of auctions for poppies with such screens - they all ended in the region of $ 2,000. <br><br>  As a result, I saw the next <a href="">lot</a> . <br><br>  MacBook Pro 17, 2.4 GHz, 1920 by 1200, 160 GB, extended warranty until 2010.  The price for buy now is 1,700 dollars plus 35 dollars for delivery.  The price suited me, the machine itself, too - even though it was poyuzannaya with scratches at the bottom.  But the appearance I was a little worried.  My experience of traveling with my acer showed that no scratches will appear.  It was also convenient that the laptop was sold as with the ability to make Buy Now - and I really wanted to get a laptop to NG. <br><br>  Well, I decided, and by clicking Buy Now, I made a mistake - I paid the lot immediately.  I can immediately say that in any case, after winning the lot on ebay, you should contact the seller, write to him how you want to pay and where you want to get the delivery.  And get from him apruv. <br>  For payment, I used PayPal - for this I had to attach a Visa E @ Card card from VTB24 to it, ordinary Visa Classic did not fit. <br><br>  The second nuance that is worth paying attention to if you, like me, have a dollar card.  By default, PayPal converts the payment amount into the currency of your place of residence.  In my case, in rubles.  Those.  in fact, the following will happen - the conversion of the amount in dollars into rubles at the rate of PayPal, the conversion of rubles into dollars at the rate of VTB and the withdrawal from the card.  Which leads to the overhead projector - there was not enough 1,770 dollars in the account to withdraw 1,735 dollars.  But by searching you can find a tick that cancels this conversion.  And then voila wrote off exactly 1,735 dollars. <br><br>  In 12 hours after the purchase I received a letter from the seller - ‚ÄúYour address is unconfirmed.  I will not be selling it to you.  Sorry.  Bill.  If I understand correctly in the event that the delivery address specified on Ebay coincides with the address indicated in PayPal, it is confirmed.  And many sellers require such an address.  But in this lot about this would not be a word!  What in response I wrote to him.  They say in this case it was necessary to inform about it, but if you do not want to send - then do a refund. <br>  In response, I received a letter - they say I think that PayPal does not guarantee the security of payments to non-confirmed addresses.  As a result, we were chatting with him - and as a result we came up with an idea to call PayPal and ask there.  As a result, PayPal confirmed that everything is ok.  And he said that he would send me a laptop.  Excellent, I said, and began to wait for sending.  It was on Friday.  After waiting quietly until Monday, I asked him - what about the package.  No answer.  It was not his next day, and then.  Since the eBay could only be filed after 7 days, I have nothing to do except to send letters to him.  Rather, of course, I called on the phone that he was in contact with - there was an answering machine.  And on the 18th, without any response letter from his side, I received a letter from PayPal that I received a refund to my account. <br>  Rather, they started the operation to return and when they are physically returned they will tell me separately. <br><br>  Here I sit waiting for the money.  I‚Äôm thinking that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuying a poppy mini was probably not bad, and that it can take it on ebay for $ 500. Or take a new one.  Or is the MacBook Pro similar to the one that was trying to buy.  Or nevertheless a poppy beech pro, but on easier with the price to 1k dollars. <br><br>  Or they will spit to buy a top laptop of another company in Russia for these 50k rubles, making sure that he will get a hackintosh (I‚Äôll not want to get up on my acer hackintosh, but in my opinion the leopard cannot be put up).  But I want to develop for Mac - and as far as I know xcode requires the latest version of the operating system - and this means delays in development. <br><br>  PS I would not mind getting comments in the comments.  Once again I will voice the requirements - an Intel Core 2 Duo class processor from 2 GHz.  At least 2 gigabytes of memory, better than 3. At least 160 gigs of screw.  Silent system.  Or a desktop up to 1k dollars, or a laptop up to 1800 dollars.  Mac OSX support. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47419/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47419/</a></p>
