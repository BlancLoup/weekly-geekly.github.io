  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Remote control and power device</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In any laboratory or even in the production of various complex devices, there is a need for additional, so to speak, devices, as well as everything else that helps to do this thing - the main device.  It is clear that any more or less serious laboratory can‚Äôt do without a soldering iron or oscilloscope, but in practice periodically there is a need for special devices that, due to our poorly developed industry, are either not sold or made somehow on the knee.  Moreover, all the information you need to collect piece by piece on various forums and DIY sites.  I would be glad if someone tells you exactly where you can search for such common devices that can be successfully applied in many projects with a little refinement. <br>  Probably many people on Habr√© came up with such thoughts, I propose to discuss them in this thread - to whom which devices came to mind and whether we have stores that would specialize in selling such devices.  Not finding such a device for our needs, either in the store or in the zabugr, we decided to make our own. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In short, the task was that the developers of the firmware we are sitting on the remote, and the device itself is developed in a single instance and it turns out quite expensive to constantly be near the device or come to the office to test equipment and software. <br>  Of the features - there was a need to monitor remotely the voltage on the device and supply one-time commands.  We considered several options for developing such a device, eventually settled on a teamViewer bundle + our software + our hardware.  The schematic diagram is shown below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28d/1a9/b8b/28d1a9b8b2cb680c1d8898749cd7e844.png"><br><br>  The development of the device took 3 months, taking into account the writing of the software for controlling the device and fine-tuning it to an acceptable form.  The main difficulty was to ensure adequate operation of the device in the absence of someone near the installation, so that it does not burn and the computer does not spoil.  We paid special attention to this.

Due to the large influx of Internet developers, development tools and other ancillary things are perceived in the context of developing programs and websites.  In fact, the use of these, dusty development can significantly help the development of DIY directions, including significantly reducing the budgets for the development of more serious devices. <br><br>  And what devices did you do? <br><img src="http://" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/231011/">https://habr.com/ru/post/231011/</a></p>
