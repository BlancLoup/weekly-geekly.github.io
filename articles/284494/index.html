In many forums, blood-chilling stories about scary cyberkops codenamed "Kashniks" are told. <br><br>  I was puzzled by the ensuing controversy and met with several of my friends, the first of whom works in one of the territorial departments of the UPC of the RF and occupies not the last leading position there.  My second companion I chose a friend who occupies a similar position in the system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.  Why did I invite representatives of different departments to the conversation?  Because articles 146, 272-274 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation belong to the category of the so-called ‚Äúalternative articles‚Äù, according to which the preliminary investigation can be carried out both in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and in the Investigation Committee of the Russian Federation.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Over a glass of beer, we had a rather entertaining conversation.  In short, I would like to acquaint dear readers with some excerpts from this conversation: <br><br>  <b><i>Question to both interlocutors:</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>Guys, that for incomprehensible ‚Äúbouncing‚Äù on the part of law enforcement officers began in the areas of strengthening the fight against ‚Äúcyber-crime‚Äù and the suppression of crimes related to violation of copyright and related rights?</i></b> <br><br>  Yes, there is ... There are several opinions ... Some people think that this is another ‚Äúpolitic‚Äù on the part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the leadership of which all the ‚Äúbaldness has eaten‚Äù to the guys on Old Square due to the fact that foreign colleagues put pressure on it, because  In our country, copyright laws do not work at all, especially in the Ru area.  Others attribute such vigorous activity of "kashnikov" to the upcoming reform of the system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, as well as to an increase in the indicators of detection, the so-called "sticks".  The personnel structure of ‚Äúporridges‚Äù is no longer a secret behind seven seals.  Among them there are practically no qualified specialists in such areas as IT, information protection, suppression of crimes with the use of high-tech tools, and the repression of copyright and related rights violations.  Most of the operas do not even know the basics of criminal procedural legislation, as well as the basics of legislation on operational investigative activities.  Plus, we should not forget about the corruption scandals around these units.  Many "officers" are really afraid to be on the street. <br><br>  <b><i>Question to the SKP-shnik:</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>I want to ask you a question on the topic and subject of our conversation.</i></b>  <b><i>How many criminal cases do you have per month, and on what articles of the prosecution?</i></b> <br><br>  Approximately 10 cases per month we bring to court.  In nine cases out of ten we are charged under 146 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (violation of copyright and related rights).  The object of crime in the overwhelming mass of disks with 1C.  I have several ‚ÄúGorbushka‚Äù type fairs in my territory, so ‚Äúkashniks‚Äù every month and crawl up to me with a request to work on cutting ‚Äústicks‚Äù.  The local economic crime unit sometimes works when the authorities cannot correct the statistics. <br><br>  <b><i>And what are the sanctions in court?</i></b> <br><br>  Maximum year conditional. <br><br>  <b><i>And what about the questions of compensation for material damage to copyright holders?</i></b> <br><br>  What material damage?  Who needs it?  Recently covered the party of the left DVD with the latest news film distribution.  In the beginning, they began to sweat to rewrite and log, and then they started to search for the right holders and to send them requests.  Do you think any of the copyright holders answered me?  No one!  A few years ago, ‚Äúkashniks‚Äù with a ‚ÄúObovtsy‚Äù detained a container with porn, owners and manufacturers were not found, so still in one of the regional departments near the cops in the internal parking lot it is rotting.  Nobody needs all this fuss.  Is that the "chopstick chopstick." <br><br>  <b><i>Listen, but the "kashniki" use any special technical means when carrying out operational search activities?</i></b>  <b><i>Maybe they have any special equipment, or software, or specialists ... for example, when investigating cases involving illegal actions in relation to content?</i></b> <br><br>  Are you kidding, or kidding?  What specials.  equipment?  Recorder of the release of the opening times of the Europeans of China, but more or less laundered homeless, which is sent to test purchases.  Do you think that their ordinary operas know words like content, domain, domain name registration, administration?  I still wonder how these geniuses in Moscow managed the torrent theme ‚Äúto blow up and dig up something‚Äù!  Stopudov, some interested specialists-commerce from the "worked and the orchestra managed."  And about the removal of servak ‚Äã‚ÄãI generally keep silent.  On horseradish sledaku look for yourself on ... poo adventures?  A little bit cleverly prepared lawyer can inflate such a scandal and boil up to raise, that deprivation of a position will not get off, in special.  You can leave the zone. <br><br>  <b><i>You might think that you can not stand the technique?</i></b> <br><br>  Technique endure and retain in their mayhem only morons.  There is an unlimited number of ways to fix evidence in a criminal case within the framework of a law without forcing fears and hysterics.  Moreover, if there is not enough evidence, but the ‚Äútexture‚Äù of the investigator is on hand, the suspect himself is interested in minimizing adverse consequences for himself, and under certain circumstances without pressure, he will provide everything himself.  You know that very well!  And to make servers from providers - complete nonsense!  Although, I can not say for sure who is right about the situation that was in Moscow.  I am not familiar with the materials of that case. <br><br>  <b><i>Well, did you have at least one case on the 28th head of the Criminal Code (computer crime)?</i></b> <br><br>  I do not, but the police in our territory was.  Yes, swum!  A few years ago, a drunken student somehow managed to get the ATM stuck.  OVO-shniki passing by thought that he wanted to steal money.  Brought to the nearest police station.  In the department, the sledak on duty managed to initiate a criminal case against the student under Part 1.  Art.  272 of the Criminal Code, as  I considered that the ATM is a computer and the student ‚Äúhacked‚Äù it, because  I had a USB cable with me.  Thank God that the district prosecutor was in mind and the decision to initiate a criminal case was canceled.  And laughter and tears. <br><br>  <b><i>Question to MIA-shnik:</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>Buddy, are you asking me the same questions?</i></b>  <b><i>Comment on a colleague!</i></b> <br><br>  There is nothing to add.  I confirm everything in full!  In my territory, there is still "more fun" situation.  In short, tie, the beer is heated! <br><br>  At the same time, we started a conversation on the topic. <br><br>  And from myself I can tell the story that I myself witnessed, because  One of our clients got into it.  A few years ago, a so-called ‚Äúcyber-telephone attack‚Äù was committed to one commercial structure that provides services in the field of logistics, due to which all phones and Internet connections were blocked for several weeks. <br><br>  The result of this attack led to the fact that during this period the company stopped, because  most clients could not contact her office.  All attempts to contact were reduced to the fact that when dialing the phone number of the company, in response to the short beeps were heard.  The telecom operator and provider only shrugged and could not help, or maybe they just did not want to.  The owners of the company turned to the gallant "kashniks" for protection. <br><br>  For three days, these cyberkopes, under various pretexts, refused to accept the application.  After the statement was finally accepted, the ‚Äúkashniks‚Äù began to ask questions to the merchants about what they wanted.  The behavior of cybercopes put the applicants into a stupor.  Pathetic requests such as ‚Äúis it possible to pierce subscribers from whose numbers are being hammered, or to identify the villains who organized the attack,‚Äù were simply ignored. <br><br>  More interesting: the operas offered the merchants to independently contact all communication service operators that operate in the city (at that time there were more than two dozen) and, through their security services, find out where the hammering is going, then go to the address and detain the villains, after Why pass them into the hands of "kashnikov."  To the question: "Why do we have to do this ourselves?" The answer was received: "We do not have special equipment and specialists who could help you." <br><br>  Merchants out of a state of stupor out, but went into a state of out!  There is nothing to do ... And they went, the sun burned, to the nearest detective agency ... In a few hours, private detectives set the points from which the ‚Äúhammering‚Äù was carried out, and the next day they installed the villains themselves and let them outside surveillance.  How the points were established, I can not know, most likely through personal informal contacts among the city‚Äôs telecom operators.  The conjectures of businessmen about the unfairness of competitors were confirmed, because  points stood in their warehouse areas.  The information received on the same day passed "kashniki."  The latter woke up wild enthusiasm!  It was decided to "pick up the box" detectives and detain the villains.  All information, including photo and video detectives passed brave operas.  They decided to detain them at one of the metro stations.  It was produced according to all the canons of Hollywood action movies.  During the detention, the villain got his nose sticking and knocking cones into the skull. <br><br>  All is well!  The villain is detained, and justice prevails!  After a few minutes, detectives approach the valiant cyberkopes and it turns out that the detainee had nothing to do with the investigation and does not have it.  And on the photo and video recorded a completely different character.  A curtain!  Music!  A few days later, the ‚ÄúKashniks‚Äù deigned to visit the points and interview the watchmen of the warehouses.  Swotting has stopped.  Though thanks for that :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284494/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284494/</a></p>
