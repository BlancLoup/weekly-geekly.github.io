      Apple announced its intention to buy Beats back in May.  The purchase will occur in several stages: $ 2.6 billion will be paid immediately, and 400 million will be transferred over time.  The company Beats was founded by the famous rapper Dr.  Dre and music producer Jimmy Iovine (Jimmy Iovine), and his wide fame thanks to the <a href="http://www.cnet.com/topics/headphones/best-headphones/">headphones</a> , which became iconic for pop culture.  In addition, the company launched a music service with a subscription, which caught the attention of Apple CEO Tim Cook. <br><br>  In an interview for the Wall Street Journal, Cook once confessed: "We really like the subscription service created by the Beats." <br><br>  Apple said it hopes to complete the deal by the end of its fiscal year in September.  As with any major merger, Apple must first send a request and receive confirmation from global regulatory agencies.  The European Commission, as a rule, <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-beats-deal-to-get-eu-decision-by-july-30/">makes decisions</a> relatively quickly.  Apple is still awaiting a response from US regulators. <br><br>  To reinforce its merger clearance, the European Commission stressed that Apple and Beats will face several competitors in the headphone market, including companies such as Bose and Sony. <br><br>  The regulators also studied the Beats music service and again did not express any concerns about the streaming music market.  According to their statement, there are no special concerns, since Beats Music is not available for use in the territory of the European Union.  They also added that Apple will not be able to monopolize the market, because in the niche of streaming music, the Beats Music service takes up only a small share. <br><br>  According to the agency: ‚Äúthe commission concluded that the merger will not affect Apple‚Äôs opportunities and incentives to deprive competing streaming music services of access to iOS, the company‚Äôs mobile operating system.  In particular, this conclusion was made on the basis of the fact that before the purchase of Beats, Apple had already been active in the field of digital music distribution.  Consequently, a takeover should not change a company's ability or incentive to block access to its mobile operating system. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234773/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234773/</a></p>
