But after each publication I received many questions about the choice of a budget quadcopter, which can broadcast video on the console.  It is clear that many people are interested in the budget version of the first quadcopter, since after my article <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/254582/">‚ÄúBuy a quadrocopter and say goodbye to him‚Äù</a> many became witnesses of how in a few minutes I said goodbye to a quadrocopter for $ 500, a suspension for $ 300 and a camera for $ 600 that in modern Russia is not very budget. <br><br>  Today I decided to combine all my knowledge about budget FPV quadrocopters, comparing the best of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96c/4eb/893/96c4eb893d5840cf89db3a1a6e8cac2b.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, we will compare the following options: <br>  1. WLtoys V686G - <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/u9">$ 59.99</a> <br>  2. Cheerson CX-30S - <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/u5">$ 130.21</a> <br>  3.

      <br>
      And now in order for each model. <br><br>  <b>WLtoys V686</b> has 4 models: <br>  1. WLtoys V686 is the simplest model, costs about ~ $ 51, but does not even have a camera.  Similar to the more popular model Syma X5, which can be bought for $ 40 <br><br>  2. WLtoys V686 <b>J</b> - already has a camera on board and you can watch the video after the flight.  Its competitor is again a model from Sims: Syma X5C <br><br>  3. WLtoys V686 <b>K</b> - more suitable for this review, since it has a FPV system and can transfer video to the phone using a wifi connection.  It can be compared with the Cheerson CX-30W, I will tell about it below. <br><br>  4. WLtoys V686 <b>G</b> is the most interesting model from the line, as there is a monitor on board right away and due to this the video transmission frequency is 5.8Ghz, and therefore the flight distance with the picture will be much further than the picture on the phone via WiFi.  The price of course for the monitor and the range of flight increases, it is not very much ~ <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/u9">$ 59.99</a> . <br><br>  Even in this quadcopter, I liked the ability to record video in 2 places at once, that is, not only on the quadcopter itself, but also on the monitor, where the image is being transmitted.  That is, there is another card in the monitor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8b/a7a/115/a8ba7a11591f4d79b8709638a6a18218.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Cheerson CX-30</b> - this quadcopter has proven itself at the expense of the younger brother Cheerson CX-10, which at the expense of timely entry into the market and affordable price of $ 15-20 collected thousands of sales, so that the big brother worth $ 50-140 became very popular . <br><br>  There are several modifications: <br>  1. Cheerson CX-30 <b>W</b> (Wifi) - the first one costs about $ 50 and includes only the quadcopter itself, that is, the console is not included in the kit and you will have to organize the management through a special program on your phone via a wifi connection.  But this is the cheapest solution, in which you can fly and see a picture from the first person.  True, there are 3 serious drawbacks: <br>  - Firstly, it is not too easy to control a quadcopter using touch joysticks and I must say that it is much less pleasant than the tactile sensation of any joystick. <br>  - The second minus is typical for budget quadcopters - this is the range.  The quadcopter can fly only up to 50 meters, which of course is not too impressive if you have already gone out and are planning to look somewhere far away. <br>  - The third significant disadvantage is the delay in transferring data from the quadrocopter to the phone.  She is such that flying around the camera is almost impossible.  And the farther you fly away - the longer the delay.  This is of course a problem due to the fact that the only connection between the quadcopter and the pilot is WiFi. <br><br>  But if you can solve the problem with tactile sensations and flight range by purchasing a version with a remote control and a phone mount (it is called the Cheerson CX-30A), the delay in transferring the picture still doesn‚Äôt make the monitor a full-fledged system for flying. <br><br>  2. Cheerson CX-30 <b>S</b> - the good news is that the Cheerson CX-30 has an older version with the letter "S", which includes a remote control and a monitor.  Here the picture is already transmitted using a transmitter with a frequency of 5.8 GHz, so the picture response will be adequate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/555/e9f/506/555e9f5061664ff98c05599270bc80a5.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Hubsan H107</b> is also a series of quadcopters, which consists of a low-cost H107L, a quadrocopter with a H107C camera and of course the most interesting is a quadrocopter with FPV - Hubsan H107D <br><br>  Hubsan H107D is probably the most famous representative in Russia.  On Ali, I found a lot about which left as many as <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/u6">116 reviews</a> , but this seller has quite a few bad reviews, so I do not recommend ordering from him.  As for the product itself, I speak only positively about it and recommend reading much more complete reviews <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GSNWB5K">on Amazon</a> , but if to describe briefly, then write the following: <br>  - perfect for indoor use; <br>  - there are difficulties when flying on the monitor, because of the narrow view (the camera is pointing down); <br>  - it is difficult to fly if there is a wind; <br>  - can not keep the height (like all mini-quadcopters); <br>  - only 20-60 meters transmits the image. <br><br>  Description: <br>  Length: 140 mm <br>  Width: 140 mm (fits easily on the palm) <br>  Height: 32 mm <br>  LCD screen: 86 mm <br>  Memory Card: Micro SD <br>  Flight time: 8 minutes <br>  Batteries: 1S 380mAh 3.7V LiPo. <br>  Charger: USB. <br>  Frequency: 4-channel 2.4GHz <br>  Video transmission: 5.8GHz <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31f/3b7/392/31f3b73924134a02ab7f81a75073a4d5.jpg"><br><br>  <b>JJRC H9D</b> is the least known model in Russia.  It was possible to find about her only a few English-language reviews.  In general, it is rated at 4+, but when the wind is spoken they talk a little (which is not surprising without GPS), and they also scold the tilt of the camera, since it is difficult to fly around the monitor. <br><br>  Camera: 2.0 or 0.3mp (look more carefully than the description, there are different) <br>  Action Time: about 8 minutes <br>  Dimensions: 23 x 23 x 13cm <br>  Remote Distance: 150 meters <br>  Charging time: 60 minutes <br>  Charging: USB <br>  Battery: 3.7v 600mAh Lithium Battery (or 500mAh, different vendors in different ways) <br>  Control channels: 4 channels <br>  Weight: 450g. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/065/a05/967/065a05967baa4e3490ae839d958ba949.jpg"><br><br>  <b>WLtoys V666</b> - the largest of the presented here, but also the most expensive.  However, you can buy it for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/u8">$ 158.39</a> , taking into account the delivery, so it makes sense to tell about it. <br><br>  I must say that this is the heaviest quadrocopter presented, but at the expense of a 7.4V 1200 mAh battery, it is just as capable of holding 8 minutes of flight. The camera is installed on it, like in older models - with vibration pads that should be saved from the jelly effect filming.  In addition, it has a 4 gig card included. <br><br>  Unlike its younger model (V262), the range of flights is increased, due to the fact that the antenna is led to one of the propellers.  And even though this range is still about 100 meters - in these 100 meters you can fly very quickly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/423/f9a/ec0/423f9aec0a0d40d9b765b5f97a9ce992.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Compare visually.</b> <br>  I chose the 5 most important parameters in my opinion for comparison.  It: <br>  1. Price - unconditionally for a budget quadcopter; price is very important; <br>  2. Camera - The quality of shooting is also a very important parameter, since this is the image that you will see on the monitor; <br>  3. Frequency of video transmission - I took this parameter instead of the flight distance with a video signal, since the more - the further; <br>  4. Size - size matters when we talk about where we will fly and how we will resist the wind; <br>  5. Flight time - I think it is obvious to everyone that all quadrocopters fly only a few minutes, so take into account the difference. <br><br>  Price: <br>  1. WLtoys V686G - <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/rc-quadcopters/pp_141289.html">$ 103.99</a> with my promo code: GBV686G <br>  2. Cheerson CX-30S - <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/u5">$ 139</a> <br>  3. Hubsan H107D - <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/u6">$ 127.29</a> <br>  4. JJRC H9D - <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/za">$ 84.98</a> <br>  5. WLtoys V666 - <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/u8">$ 158.39</a> <br><br>  Camera: <br>  1. WLtoys V686G - 2.0 MP <br>  2. Cheerson CX-30S - 0.3 MP <br>  3. Hubsan H107D - 0.3 MP <br>  4. JJRC H9D - 0.3 MP <br>  5. WLtoys V666 - 2.0 MP <br><br>  Video Frequency: <br>  1. WLtoys V686G - 5.8 GHz <br>  2. Cheerson CX-30S - 5.8 GHz <br>  3. Hubsan H107D - 5.8 GHz <br>  4. JJRC H9D - 5.8 GHz <br>  5. WLtoys V666 - 5.8 GHz <br><br>  The size: <br>  1. WLtoys V686G - 200 * 200 * 93 mm <br>  2. Cheerson CX-30S - 155 * 155 * 50 mm <br>  3. Hubsan H107D - 120 * 120 * 60 mm <br>  4. JJRC H9D - 230 * 230 * 130 mm <br>  5. WLtoys V666 - 525 * 525 * 60 mm <br><br>  Flight time: <br>  1. WLtoys V686G - 8-10 minutes <br>  2. Cheerson CX-30S - 8 minutes <br>  3. Hubsan H107D - 7 minutes <br>  4. JJRC H9D - 8 minutes <br>  5. WLtoys V666 - 8-10 minutes <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  It can be seen that the camera with a better resolution is near the cheapest and most expensive option, so the WLtoys V686G with a 2.0 MP camera wins and costs $ 104. <br><br>  Surprisingly, all the options with a monitor have a fairly decent data transfer rate, so everyone here defeated their younger fellows with a wifi connection to the phone.  Here I will separately note the Hubsan H107D and the Cheerson CX30S, which, despite the decent data transmission frequency, will be mastered no more than 50 meters, but the range of all others is at a level of 100-150 meters. <br><br>  In size, the WLtoys V666 was the largest expected, and the smallest Hubsan H107D.  No wonder habsan recommended for home flights, and V666 for flying on the street.  The average options are more versatile, in my opinion, the optimal size of the WLtoys V686G and the JJRC H9D, but then of course everything is purely personal. <br><br>  The flight time for all is approximately at the same level, but the WLtoys V686G and WLtoys V666 in the descriptions were distinguished by a difference of 10 minutes.  Of course, this should be tested, but in general it is clear that all quadcopters are on the same level. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  In my opinion, the cheapest quadcopter WLtoys V686G showed the most outstanding results for its price, so I decided to buy it. <br><br>  The parcel was sent to me on March 5 and while it is on the way: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42c/cbd/231/42ccbd23107c45b590b92f40a4a749e1.jpg"><br><br>  As soon as the quadcopter comes to me - I will definitely tell you how it is in practice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377247/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377247/</a></p>
