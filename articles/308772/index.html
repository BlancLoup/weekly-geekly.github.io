As I promised in the comments, I upload my programs on GitHub.  I'll start with DisType Pro.  The repository is <a href="https://github.com/aacidov/DisTypePro-android">here</a> , but before writing about what I want to do and what I need help with, I‚Äôll tell you about the history of this program: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd5/592/29a/bd559229a24140eb8b4efde9c1ad52ee.png"><br>  <i>DisType pro.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First I want to express my gratitude for the publication and editing of <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/308514/">this post to the</a> moderators Habr!  I advise you to first read the post, she said cool.  And I do not want to reprint here. <br><br><h3>  Head zero.  Cordova App. </h3><br>  September 2015.  A volunteer who was going to take me to the concert ‚Äú15 years of the film Brother 2: Live Soundtrack‚Äù asked me to think of something so that she could steer and talk to me.  Yes, yes, with the words TYZHPROGRAMMIST.  I made a simple application on Cordova with input'om full screen.

      It was fun and convenient.  We went to a concert, and I somehow forgot about this application, I was too lazy to fill in the play market ... For icons, descriptions, etc. <br><br><h3>  Chapter one.  Native app. </h3><br>  January 2016.  I was called to a webinar on Caritas AK, called to show as a symbol.  Because my family actively adopted AK methods in my early childhood.  At 5 years old I owned about a set of 200 gestures.  They say this is a unique case with my degree of CPD.  But back to the webinar.  When I was preparing for the presentation, I transferred my AK funds and remembered about the convenient application that I wrote.  Included it in the presentation.  Got a positive reaction and decided to pour. <br><br>  But having a negative experience with the publication of Cordova (it‚Äôs difficult to sign apk, I don‚Äôt know ... throw a slipper at me).  I decided to write an application in Java.  I don‚Äôt know how miraculously with my experience with java it turned out to write a working application, but it worked.  As I wrote in the first post, just an application with an input field and a button to say is somehow silly.  I added saving phrases when I clicked the button in the database and output them to the ListView with sorting by rating.  When you click a phrase in the list, the program spoke it and increased the phrase rating by one.  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.ibakaidov.distype">Laid to google play,</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e1/fbf/785/1e1fbf7859cb4e0f89ba64053127377b"><br>  <i>Distype</i> <br><br><h3>  Chapter two  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.ibakaidov.distypepro">DisType Pro.</a> </h3><br>  After using DisType, I realized that the list of phrases is useless.  It is long, it is difficult to find what you need.  Faster re-type the text.  By the way, speed is a super important thing in the dialogue.  I always do not have time for dialogue. <br><br>  Then I decided to sort the phrases into categories, added two ListViews, one sheet for categories, another for phrases, and organized the transfer of phrases.  It has become much more convenient.  He talked, sat down after talking and put phrases into categories.  Although in the taxi while you go home from the girl there is something to do. <br><br>  Another feature of the Pro version is switching between dialogs.  There is a small lyrical performance.  I'm typing something for a girl, her mom comes in, asks: "are you going home soon, dear friend?"  And I, instead of erasing the sonnet that I wrote for the girl, in order to answer my mother: ‚Äúmy life here will last no more than half an hour‚Äù.  I can just switch to another dialogue. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YKLEyeHqJYM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi1UF_ojYpqZC5aYk_F1atZtlwJqQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  By the way, my girlfriend prints on the tablet with her foot (no, I do not specifically choose girls with unusual ways to type, it turns out that way), I want to make a video like she does and try a special Android keyboard for the big toe.  (Will you help? :)). <br><br>  Here is what she writes about DT: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúToday I communicated with the help of the‚Äú DisType ‚Äùprogram with a psychiatrist who came to my house to work out the MSEC documents.  (yes, yes, in this country you have to go through a psychiatrist to get a pension, and another 20 doctors) <br>  It was very convenient for me to talk like that. <br><br>  My relatives used to speak with me for the doctors, and it was not very good, because they still cannot describe my state of health in such detail as I can. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><h3>  Chapter Three  Help community Habra. </h3><br>  After the first article I received hundreds of letters offering to help.  I couldn‚Äôt even answer everyone ... I'm sorry. <br>  And so, what are the ways I see the development of this program and in what I need help: <br><br><ul><li>  Putting the code in order.  Due to the fact that I did not study anywhere (I study in the special dynamics school, I will go to the 10th grade) to program, my programming skills are not very good, and I understand that my code is far from ideal ... </li><li>  <s>Additions search.</s>  <s>I think it would be cool to make sure that when you type in phrases, a list of the search phrases already spoken in the database will appear.</s>  <s>I do not know how to do this in terms of layout and design.</s>  done by @rbugaian </li><li>  Creating a phrase storage server.  Create a single server, in which all the spoken phrases will be drained, moderated and sent to all users. </li><li>  Promotion.  Ideally, a tablet with this program should be supplied to anyone who does not speak.  But this is a utopia ... But the competent advertising company has really helped.  By the way, tablet manufacturers can not be interested in public procurement ?. </li></ul><br>  Thank you all for the help!
