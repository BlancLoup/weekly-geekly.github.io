I noticed that there are people on the site who know about Bolid and its integrated security system, Orion.  But just recently I found out.  That the Orion ISO is not the only working arrangement.  It turns out comrades from the glorious city of Korolev have developed their SCADA and controller to automate the building's IP.  In short, I would like to tell you about them in this article. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Instead of a disclaimer:</b> <br>  I‚Äôll just say that the post is not advertising and I don‚Äôt have the intention of promoting ‚ÄúBolid‚Äù, it‚Äôs just that this company offers very popular solutions on the security market, and it‚Äôs no secret that I regularly come across it in my projects.  Therefore, I decided that the information may be of interest to specialists.  True, I will honestly say that the knowledge in this matter is very superficial for me, and in this article I first of all just want to inform you about the existence of SCADA from Bolid, the post does not pretend to be a tutorial in any way. <br>  "Background" does not carry technical information, rather the emotional part.  If someone doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúspotty‚Äù mood, you won‚Äôt lose anything without reading.

      <b>Background:</b> <br>  It all started with the fact that my colleague and I visited the Hi-Tech Building 2012 exhibition, where the Bolida pavilion caught our attention, or rather not the entire pavilion (because in itself it was not interesting, due to the lack of free chocolates) but only one of the walls of this pavilion. <br>  On which on monitors it was spinning, something causing at the same time the desire to "tear out the eye" and curiosity. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">SCADA algorithm on the car stand</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/054/c36/414/054c3641429c63ce83e0007ea1ab4bdb.jpg" alt="image"></div></div><br>  . <br>  As soon as my colleague and I approached the stand with SCADA, an inspired specialist of the company immediately came up to us, who told us about this software product, especially proud that the fans on the screen rotate due to gif animation. <br><br>  My colleague and I were so moved that we considered it a samurai‚Äôs duty to attend a free seminar on <a href="http://www.bolid.ru/support/teach/teach_9.html">‚ÄúBuilding Engineering Equipment Management‚Äù</a> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Bad seminar photo</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a0a/359/34b/a0a35934b71fc2b92508d9ae07c03b4c.jpg" alt="image"></div></div><br><br>  The seminar certainly left ambiguous feelings.  On the one hand free and useful.  On the other hand, the endless repetition of the same information about the equipment and solutions, the Alogritm SCADA itself, showed a glimpse of about three minutes at the very end. <br>  As a summary of the seminar - I think if someone is interested to go get information is quite possible (in the end, during a break you will be treated with cookies) <br><br>  Equipment and its application: <br><br>  I will talk about in the same order as they were told at the seminar I mentioned above. <br><br>  The workshop began with a story about the device S2000-PP <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">S2000-PP</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/884/fcc/a0c/884fcca0c8af6d9af9309187379b2630.jpg" alt="image"></div></div><br><br>  This device is a protocol converter from ‚ÄúOrion‚Äù - to ‚ÄúModbus / TD‚Äù <br>  Using the converter, you can both read information about the status of devices in ISO Orion and send commands to the equipment of the Orion system, for example, on the Signal-20 device, close the relay responsible for switching on the Siren.  Read more on the <a href="">site</a> <br><br>  The next workshop block was dedicated to the C2000-T controller. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">S2000-T</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/96e/dc6/3d3/96edc63d3cdafaf488e723e69548cdab.jpg" alt="image"></div></div><br><br>  Technological controller S2000-T allows you to control the following processes: <br>  forced-air ventilation, air conditioning, hot water supply, heating, <br>  steam humidification, well, any other process that you can configure yourself. <br>  The device is sold in two forms of ‚Äúblind‚Äù (only LEDs for indication) and with an LCD operator panel. <br>  The heart of this device is the PIC controller (My colleague <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/drzugrik/" class="user_link">Drzugrik</a> and I remembered a long time ... in my opinion there is a PIC16) <br>  Special pride of the specialists, the company is a niche occupied by this controller. It is supposed to use this controller as a budget median solution, with advanced configuration functions and few programming features. <br>  For the controller there is a set of typical configurations, which is periodically updated. <br>  As a second option, it is proposed using the system of conditional structures to program the device's reaction to events in the system. <br>  Also, the instrument implements the control function according to the PID control law. <br>  The controller is certified as a measurement tool. <br><br>  In 2013, they promise to flash the device to version 2.0.  One of the "chips" of this firmware should be the possibility of the logical combination of two controllers into one. <br><br>  Detailed technical information about the hardware and the logic of the device can be found on the <a href="">website.</a> <br><br>  Address thermohygrometer "S2000-W" <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">S2000-W</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f5/f4e/5df/3f5f4e5dfd97086a4816b08d45dbefc6.jpg" alt="image"></div></div><br><br>  The temperature and humidity sensor for the ISO Orion system, as well as temperature sensors at the workshop, suggested the use of analogue heat detectors. <br>  More details as always on the <a href="http://www.bolid.ru/production/devices/devices_172.html">site</a> . <br><br>  S2000-ASR2 <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">S2000-ASR2</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/475/3de/364/4753de3644c3a961c6639793a409b25a.jpg" alt="image"></div></div><br><br>  Address controller for water meters, electricity, gas with <br>  pulse output.  The counter is also a counter in Africa; it allows you to integrate the readings of water or electricity meters into the Orion system. Link to the <a href="http://www.bolid.ru/production/management/management_145.html">site</a> <br><br>  <b>Application of equipment</b> <br><br>  With the help of the C2000-T, you can assemble an autonomous automatic control system. <br>  It is assumed that the C2000-KDL is connected to the controller, and the address sensors and relay units of the Orion system are connected to the ‚ÄúKDL‚Äù.  You can also connect other S2000-T controllers to the controller in Slave mode, which will execute their own algorithms.  The system has many limitations, for example, the controller will not pull more than one S2000-KDL, well, this controller works only with SCADA ‚ÄúAlgorithm‚Äù. <br>  The controller is programmed and configured through the S2000-T Configurator (included in the SCADA Algorithm package) <br>  Screenshot configurator under the spoiler: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Configurator</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="http://s43.radikal.ru/i100/1211/35/bca6a71145e6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br></div></div><br><br>  I will say right away, I didn‚Äôt bother with this program seriously, but it‚Äôs inconvenient to work. <br><br>  SCADA "Algorithm": <br>  Since at the seminar, she was given quite a bit of time (apparently, because this product, well, a very weak point of the system), and I am not an expert at SCADA, I will tell you very briefly. <br><br>  SCADA is designed for Bolid equipment. <br>  SCADA integrates with AWP Orion (imports data from the database), in principle, when the C2000 console is installed, this SCADA can be used as an AWP (even more advanced version). <br>  SCADA has an executable file client and a web client. <br><br>  There is a demo version running for 40 minutes is supported by one OPC server (if I'm not mistaken, I write from memory).  It costs by itself 10000r (this is probably the main advantage) + additional fees for extensions and configurations. <br>  You can read in detail on the <a href="http://www.bolid.ru/soft/disp/disp_37.html">site</a> , there are manuals and instructions. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">SCADA Algorithm</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Very annoying program download <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/341/9a0/99a/3419a099a672c206f70b1b34ae2342d2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Web Client <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/834/3dc/63e/8343dc63e1c7a4e37e54af74a0d36b6d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Program client (floor plan) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b1/5ed/fad/4b15edfad9877d6534e7cf42e0fab38e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br></div></div><br><br><br>  Afterword: <br>  The first thing that was fun at the seminar was the icon ‚ÄúDelphi 7‚Äù that shines proudly on the desktop of their computer, which somehow involuntarily suggests that everything shown during the seminar software is written on it.  At first glance, all software products from the company ‚ÄúBolid‚Äù are not digestible.  Yes, and quality decisions are lagging behind foreign systems of automatic dispatch, but on the other hand, Bolid can boast an affordable price and more or less adequate support. <br>  I hope this article was interesting to you, maybe someone will be interested and write a more complete review of SCADA "Algorithm", I will be very happy (I do not have enough qualifications now, but stupidly copy the instructions and presentation there is no desire) <br><br>  PS This text may have some rough edges ... Friday, I was in a hurry to finish by the end of the working day.  Have a great weekend everyone (I will be glad to your comments and remarks) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160883/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160883/</a></p>
