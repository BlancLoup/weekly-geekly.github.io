Since then, much has changed, both in the data storage architecture and in information processing algorithms. <br><br>  It's about the service for SEO specialists and / or ordinary webmasters.  BotHunter is a passive monitoring system (in real time) for user agents on your site.  Examples of interfaces, see below, or in a DEMO account on the <a href="http://bothunter.ru/">site of the system</a> (limited functionality in demo mode).

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  Considering my appetites and the amount of data analyzed, I wrote this service for myself.  For me, it is more understandable is the "graphic answer" to all questions.  Frequently asked questions BotHunter will answer: <br><ul><li>  Search robots visited my site, when, how often? </li><li>  Who parsed my site &amp; when, seeming to be a search bot? </li><li>  How many pages of my site have been loaded by a search robot? </li><li>  How many pages that visited search crawler participate in the search? </li><li>  How many pages participating in search bring traffic? </li><li>  What is the proportion of landing page (s) that the search bot visited, but they were never entry points (from search engines)? </li><li>  How many pages from Sitemap.XML have been indexed? </li><li>  the search bot visits my site all the time, is that enough? </li><li>  Is it possible in one system to see the data on working with Yandex, Google, Search.Mail.ru, Bing, Yahoo!  (on the big list of my sites)? </li><li>  Are there pages on the site that can be ‚Äúharmful‚Äù for search engine promotion? </li><li>  etc.  etc. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/60b/9a6/105/60b9a6105fbac470dc2b138c1d425112.png"><br><br><h4>  There is a finished bike </h4><br>  At once I would like to stop those who are ready to ask the question ‚ÄúWhy?  Are there Yandex.Webmaster and google webmasters? " <br>  Yes, these services are useful and well-known, but they will not answer the following questions: <br><br>  1. Are there pages on my site that bots know about, but they are not in Sitemap.XML? <br>  2. Is there a page on my site that the bot has visited, but there has never been any traffic on them (I want a list)? <br>  3. What is the share of urls, the crawlers constantly visit, but they are not in the search? <br>  4. Is there a page on my site with the same weight in bytes (also a duplicate theme)? <br>  5. After updating the search base (or changing the algorithm) of such and such a number;  How many pages of the site do not visit bots anymore?  And how many of them are no longer traffic entry points from organic delivery? <br>  6. etc. <br>  The list of interesting questions can be continued, and each of us will have our own list ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d6/909/580/0d6909580a717b8a23f9ad028a7dd80d.png"><br><br><h4>  What are the advantages of the service </h4><br><ul><li>  there is an event notification system (according to the list of criteria) </li><li>  There is no limit to the number of sites in one account. </li><li>  it makes no sense to look for a ‚Äúneedle‚Äù in a stack of logs, the system itself will inform you about the event </li><li>  we analyze and present data on several search engines in one interface </li><li>  it is possible to analyze not only the entire site, but only its slice, segment, etc.  (based on regular expressions for urla) </li><li>  All data is stored in our cloud and history is available from the moment the site is registered in the system. </li><li>  reports prevent fuzzy duplicates </li><li>  if you regularly parse your site, we will let you know who it is.  You will not need to constantly log logs </li><li>  the service is free </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/561/800/896/5618008964debdc226543f24f46ffa26.png"><br><br>  In addition to simple and clear reports, BotHunter daily checks the integrity of the robots.txt and sitemap.xml files for each of your sites.  Regarding sitemap.xml a separate song, the file is being tested for validity and compliance with the sitemap protocol.  The system writes a journal about all checks and facts of report generation on a daily basis. <br><br><h4>  What's in the plans </h4><br><ul><li>  detection of deviations from the statistical indexing rate (of your site) </li><li>  identification of typical errors </li><li>  recommendations on indexing settings (considering the features of each site) </li><li>  [collection] collection of key phrases that brought traffic to the site </li><li>  [collection expansion] getting a list of key phrases recommended for the site </li><li>  integration with Google Analytics to predict traffic loss (by site segments) </li><li>  what is useful for specialists (your recommendations and ideas) </li></ul><br><br>  ps about TTX, briefly: <br><ul><li>  own server group is used in DC Filanco </li><li>  we store and analyze all data in NoSQL, if more specifically, I use MongoDB </li><li>  your log files are not stored, only the results of processing </li><li>  For authorization use your profile in: facebook, yandex or google </li></ul><br><br>  The main objective of this post is <b>to get your advice</b> . <br>  What other data would you like to receive and in what form? <br>  What ideas would you suggest? <br><br>  Thank you in advance for constructive criticism ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180849/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180849/</a></p>
