Given that the voting on this issue has not yet begun, and 5 alpha has already been released, and the first beta version 5.5 is <a href="http://news.php.net/php.internals/66149">scheduled for</a> March 7, Zend Optimizer + probably will not be included in the next version.  But it can not but rejoice that the code of the tool is already open and accessible to everyone!  The repository of the project is <a href="https://github.com/zend-dev/ZendOptimizerPlus/">here</a> , there is also an assembly instruction. </li><li>  <a href="http://php.net/index.php">PHP 5.4.12 and PHP 5.3.22</a> - Regular updates and, as always, a <a href="http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php">bundle of bug fixes</a> inside <a href="http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php">are released</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://php.net/archive/2013.php">PHP 5.5.0alpha5</a> - <a href="http://php.net/archive/2013.php">Unplanned</a> alpha release, which, in addition to bug fixes, contains minor innovations in the MySQLi API and Mysqlnd and a few others.  Full list of changes <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-5.5.0alpha5/NEWS">here</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/company/news/press/395_zend-launches-zend-studio-10-driving-the-next-decade-of-ides">Zend launches Zend Studio 10</a> - The new version of the IDE, as <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/company/news/press/386_zend-unveils-end-to-end-solution-enabling-mobile-first-approach-to-application-development">previously announced</a> , focuses on developing a backend for mobile applications and integrating with cloud services. </li><li>  <a href="http://bolt.cm/newsitem/bolt-10-stable-released">Release Bolt 1.0</a> - After six months of work, the first stable version of the CMS, based on the Silex framework and the symfony components, has finally been released. </li></ul><br><br><h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a1b/ab6/308/a1bab630889567e2a5c9bab3290d8310.png">  Php </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://gist.github.com/nikic/5015323">Why objects (usually) usually use less memory than arrays in PHP</a> - A great post from the active core PHP developer, Nikita Popov.  At first glance, it seems obvious that objects should occupy more memory, since an object is nothing but an array of properties + some additional information.  But the fact is that PHP in most cases optimizes the massive component of the object.  Read more about how it works, read the post.  It is worth noting that what is written is only relevant for PHP&gt; = 5.4. </li><li>  <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/trailing-comma-function-args">RFC: Comma at the end of the function argument list</a> - A list of array elements in PHP can be terminated with a comma: array ('Foo', 'Bar',);  which is definitely very convenient.  This RFC has proposed to add the ability to complete the list of function arguments with a comma by analogy with arrays: function ($ foo, $ bar,) {}; </li><li>  <a href="http://www.eschrade.com/page/would-this-be-a-dumb-idea-for-php-core">Stupid idea for PHP core?</a>  - The author of the post proposes to include in PHP some method that would allow caching the state of the application between launches (requests).  In general, something similar to APC or Zend Optimizer + but for caching objects and data, not an opcode.  Interesting, but this is <a href="https://twitter.com/kpschrade/status/304267089290620930">unlikely to ever be</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/opal/entry/the_mysterious_php_rfc_process">Mystical PHP RFC process, and how you can change the Web</a> - For anyone who is interested in how new features get into PHP, the author wrote a wonderful post that talks about the RFC process, making it more transparent for ordinary developers.  The author gives a lot of useful tips and recommendations for those who want to participate in the development of the language and who have something to offer. </li></ul><br><h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a93/d41/07f/a93d4107f28f667a4c3336347ef78774.png">  Study materials </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://ilia.ws/files/phpuk_bottlenecks.pdf">Analysis of Bottlenecks (PDF)</a> - Slides of the report from core PHP developer Ilya Alshanetsky from the largest PHP conference recently held in London - PHPUK 2013. </li><li>  <a href="http://unassumingphp.com/closures-lambdas-and-anonymous-functions/">Closures, lambda expressions and anonymous functions</a> - These concepts in PHP are often interchanged, but is this correct?  In the post, the author answers the question, what is the difference between lambda expressions, anonymous functions and closures, as well as what are their features in PHP. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.mwop.net/blog/2013-02-11-restful-apis-with-zf2-part-1.html">RESTful API on ZF2</a> , <a href="http://www.mwop.net/blog/2013-02-13-restful-apis-with-zf2-part-2.html">2</a> - A series of articles on building RESTful interfaces in general and on Zend Framework 2, in particular.  In the first post, the author writes about the basic principles of REST, <a href="http://restcookbook.com/Miscellaneous/richardsonmaturitymodel/">the Richardson REST services maturity model</a> , <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">Hypertext Application Language,</a> and how it can be used to define the overall structure of JSON resources.  The second part deals with such an aspect of RESTful interfaces as error messages.  The author writes that returning an error code is not enough and offers two possible solutions: <a href="https://github.com/blongden/vnd.error">vnd.error</a> and <a href="http-problem-02">API-Problem</a> .  Both articles will not affect ZF2, so they will be useful to everyone. </li><li>  <a href="http://nitschinger.at/A-Journey-on-Avoiding-Nulls-in-PHP">Getting rid of null in PHP</a> - How often do you have to write something like if (null === $ obj) in your PHP code?  Inspired by Scala and Google Guava, the author offers a more elegant solution using the wrapper class. </li><li>  <a href="http://fabien.potencier.org/article/67/don-t-use-php-libraries-with-known-security-issues">Don't use PHP libraries with known problems</a> - A great initiative from SensioLabs, thanks to which any developer using Composer to manage dependencies has the ability to automatically find potential security problems with <a href="https://security.sensiolabs.org/">security.sensiolabs.org</a> .  Users can download their composer.lock file, and the system will check dependencies for known problems and issue a report.  In addition, there is an API in case you want to automate the check.  The base of vulnerabilities is posted on <a href="https://github.com/sensiolabs/security-advisories">GitHub</a> , and anyone can help in replenishing it by simply making the appropriate pull-request. </li><li>  <a href="http://websec.io/2013/02/18/Safety-PHP-Dependencies-Composer.html">Security in PHP and Composer dependencies</a> - Some more security recommendations in dependencies managed by Composer. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.eschrade.com/page/generating-secure-cross-site-request-forgery-tokens-csrf/">Preventing CSRF attacks</a> - This post, which deals with the generation of safe CSRF tokens, has generated a wave of community discussions.  The author proposed a method of generating less predictable, and therefore safer values.  A more detailed look at the problem and the CSRF in general, made in his <a href="http://blog.ircmaxell.com/2013/02/preventing-csrf-attacks.html">post</a> Anthony Ferrara. </li><li>  <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/testing-like-a-boss-in-laravel-models/">Testing models in Laravel</a> - An excellent detailed tutorial on organizing unit testing in <a href="http://four.laravel.com/">Laravel 4</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://phpmaster.com/simplifying-test-data-generation-with-faker/">Simplify the generation of test data using Faker</a> - In <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/zfort/blog/157203/">one</a> of the previous releases mentioned useful library Faker, designed to generate data very similar to real.
