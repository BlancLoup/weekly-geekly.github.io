Games for the first consoles from Japan were so successful that they are remembered even a few decades later.  Remember and love.  Largely due to the feelings of gamers to old school games, Nintendo is still doing business now. <br><br>  And with the latest consoles, the Japanese company is not doing well.  Maybe that's why last July Nintendo <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/278462/">released the</a> NES Classic, deciding to try to go along the path that was already beaten.  NES Classic is a modern incarnation of NES, which is equipped with modern electronic components and modules.  In particular, there is an HDMI output.  Included with the prefix, the company decided to supply 30 old games. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  "We wanted to give fans of all ages the opportunity to re-open the original Nintendo system, let them remember why they liked this console so much ... Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition is perfect for anyone who remembers how to play NES, or who would like to give an opportunity to experience the taste of such a game to a new generation of gamers, ‚Äùsaid Reginald Fils-Aim√©, president and chief operating officer of Nintendo of America, at one time.

      All this is good, but except for 30 games, which were announced at the very beginning, the company decided not to give anything more to gamers.  It was clearly announced that Nintendo would not officially lay out more games, which, however, did not stop the craftsmen from finding an independent solution to this problem. <br><br>  Of course, all this is a somewhat contrived problem, since gamers can use emulators, prefixes of other developers (including very modern ones) and the same old devices to play old masterpieces.  But no one is looking for easy ways. <br><br>  The guys from the NESClassicMods community found their own solution.  In order for it to work, you need to create a save file in the first slot of the Super Mario Bros.  In general, it is very easy to do.  After that, you need to connect the NES Classic Edition to the computer via a micro USB cable, and then load the NES in FEL mode.  This can be done by holding the reset button while at the same time clamping the power button (a trick with buttons must be performed when the console is turned off).  The download will start, and on the PC at this time it is necessary to start downloading "sunxi-FEL".  An open version of this software is <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/FEL/USBBoot">here</a> . <br><br>  Of course, all this, including other steps, must be done at your own peril and risk.  The fact is that you need to copy files from NES Classic to your PC, edit them there and upload them to the console again.  If something goes wrong, the console may stop working, although the chances of it are small.  It is necessary to work with the help of an application created by craftsmen.  Among other features - on the console, you can upload ROM-games. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q2c5JLHl56g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  After everything is done, it is worth adding an image file to the game.  Then all you need to pack and send to the console.  If everything goes as it should, new games will appear on the console.  The standard list is also quite good, here we see the following names: <br>  With the prefix supplied games such as: <br><br><ul><li>  Balloon fight </li><li>  Bubble bobble </li><li>  Castlevania </li><li>  Castlevania II: Simon's Quest </li><li>  Donkey kong </li><li>  Donkey Kong Jr. </li><li>  Double Dragon II: The Revenge </li><li>  Dr.  Mario </li><li>  Excitebike </li><li>  Final fantasy </li><li>  Galaga </li><li>  Ghosts n 'goblins </li><li>  Gradius </li><li>  Ice climber </li><li>  Kid icarus </li><li>  Kirby's Adventure </li><li>  Mario Bros. </li><li>  Mega Man 2 </li><li>  Metroid </li><li>  Ninja gaiden </li><li>  Pac-man </li><li>  Punch-out !!!  Featuring Mr.  Dream </li><li>  Startropics </li><li>  Super c </li><li>  Super Mario Bros. </li><li>  Super Mario Bros.  2 </li><li>  Super Mario Bros.  3 </li><li>  Tecmo bowl </li><li>  The Legend of Zelda </li><li>  Zelda II: The Adventure of Link </li></ul><br>  But nevertheless, gamers want additional games, too, since there are a lot of them - there is always something to play. <br><br>  It is worth noting that this ‚Äúhack‚Äù is a little more than a couple of days, so that not too many users were able to test the performance of games filled in such an unusual way.  But the web has already appeared videos with Mega Man, where it is clear that there are no problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/26c/7bd/7d1/26c7bd7d166023a506fe1bcc121e33f6.png"><br>  <font color="gray">This screenshot clearly shows that among the games officially provided by Nintendo on the console appeared Battletoads</font> <br><br>  The limitations of the hardware platform are not yet clear.  It is clear that you can add more than 30 games, there are no problems.  The video above is showing us a system with 55 games, where, among others, are filled with Contra and Battletoads. <br><br>  It may well be that third-party efforts will be noticed by Nintendo.  Hopefully, after all this, she will officially start supplying official versions of old games, so as not to force gamers to come up with various workarounds.  It is clear that the hardware platform allows you to download additional games, so the question "why Nintendo does not want to give additional games" remains open. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400441/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400441/</a></p>
