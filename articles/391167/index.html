These points simply look like certain errors against the background of the general graphic image of the total ignorance of the situation.

Moreover, the links between a scattering of facts allow us to draw new conclusions, allowing thoughts to move in a certain direction and even make predictions of the emergence of new facts in the void of ignorance (putting another point on a white background). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c56/96a/6de/c5696a6de272283c911ca87594f03a54.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This is the only way human knowledge is formed - we independently set up more and more new fact points in the white void, using the connections between the previous ones.  So, in fact, the man and passed his way from a silicon ax to Silicon Valley. <br><br>  Today, many BigData adepts are in favor of collecting vast amounts of data, operating with giant bases to search for connections, and on this basis form a complete picture of the world, with virtually no white spots of ignorance.  In itself, this is wonderful, but the only question that is doubtful is who will make logical connections between facts and how?  How can a car, let us assume, on the basis of this data set, make a conclusion about fashion trends of Russian footwear? <br><br>  - In the X century, most of the inhabitants of Rostov wore bast shoes; <br>  - In the XV century, most of the inhabitants of Rostov wore bast shoes. <br><br>  What will the overwhelming majority of Rostov residents wear in the 21st century?  Lapti! <br><br>  Before us is a primitive example of the fact that the facts themselves are useless, as well as the meaningless "machine" search for links and coincidences between them.  But if there is an algorithm in the system in which the person prescribes in advance that, in addition to historical data, you need to search for information about the assortment of 21st century shoe shops in neighboring cities, then we have a chance to make an adequate forecast and correctly put a new point of knowledge.  Only an algorithm invented by a person in advance of operating and filtering data gives a chance to use all sorts of facts for the benefit of the business, achieving a specific goal with their help. <br><br>  <b>Until a person creates this algorithm and until a person places it in a machine code - a machine, possessing even all the knowledge in the world - will not be able to correctly use them for the purposes we need.</b>  <b>In unnecessary - maybe.</b> <br><br>  Immediately I want to reassure many anxious mommies and explain the constantly growing HYIP on the topic ‚Äúteach your children programming from the cradle‚Äù.  Yes, learn, but not one or two of the thousands of existing languages ‚Äã‚Äã- but logical thinking.  Learn to reason in the format of processes, source and end data, requirements and tasks.  Learn to operate information in any format and apply it properly. <br><br>  This programmer is not the one who writes the govnokod, but any person who is able to formulate a clear and unambiguous algorithm of actions to achieve the required goal in the shortest way, even verbally and unprintable words, based on the initial data.  In this regard, in my subjective opinion, the best programmers are sergeants and ensigns in the army, and not at all the hipsters who have occupied the coworking. <br><br>  Today, there are a large number of specialists in metrics and analytics who collect and analyze a huge amount of data.  Tables, charts, graphs and "pies" are a great example of using the primitive version of BigData.  However, the final decision on how to use the data obtained is always taken by another person, not the one who compiled the analytical report - but someone who sees the whole picture and has a strategic vision of tasks.  By the way, often, looking at the same tablet, different experts draw completely different conclusions and plan completely opposite actions.  Because different life experiences formed in their heads different algorithms for using the same knowledge. <br><br>  But now I see a further tendency of turning episodic BigDate points through the Big-Algorithm connection graphs into a kind of endless wheel of sansara on the web.  After all, man, while he is alive, always has needs, every second of his being.  However, while the influence of information systems on him is extremely sporadic and fragmentary - well, there is a one-time notification, well, a response to his search query, well, thanks to ‚ÄúThank you for the purchase‚Äù - nothing more.  The rest of the time, the person is left to himself, and all the knowledge and logical connections gathered about him are ‚Äúgathering dust‚Äù in the database with useless cargo. <br><br>  Selfishness and internal confrontation between different businesses does not allow information systems to infinitely predict and respond endlessly to the constantly changing needs of the user. <br><br>  For example, girls over 24 years old after buying a ticket to Thailand, as a rule, go to the choice of hotel, and girls under 24 years old - to buy underwear.  This means that a smart site should redirect them further along the path of needs.  Moreover, after booking a hotel, the first group starts choosing a cafe nearby, and the second group is already looking for acquaintances in Tinder, and here is another transition.  Next, first buy a set of things for the holiday for the child.  The second ones - investigate reviews about Thai cafes and restaurants, and so on to infinity - the system, after making its own sale, does not have the right to drop the user - but is obliged to constantly pass on the baton (with its own%, of course). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc8/bbf/c22/bc8bbfc22d51de74e50ec4666e9d4962.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From birth to death, from the set of the newborn to the reservation of a place in the cemetery - a continuous stream of interactions with the user based on his past choices.  Virtual wheel of samsara is when any action launches a new chain of algorithms, not allowing a person to leave this stream. <br><br>  For all who did not like my deliberately pop style of presentation, the highly respected <a href="http://www.globalcio.ru/workshops/1358/">Stanislav Makarov wrote all the same</a> , but in a clever and scientific language. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391167/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391167/</a></p>
