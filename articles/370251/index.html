  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Communication Verification: Xiaomi Portable Radio</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Geektimes!  Today, you guessed it, let's not talk about mobile phones.  No, smartphones are needed, but imagine this situation: you went to a rally in Europe with two cars, and the connection between them in a certain way needs to be maintained.  With different tariffs and roaming, especially moving between countries, you can easily go broke, and the radio will solve this problem without problems even at a distance of a couple of kilometers.  And this is just one of many cases of using this device: apparently, therefore, in 2017, Xiaomi decided to release the radio. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/286756/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/552/9d4/6d8/5529d46d8c3ac35e0db8234321c860af.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, if you sent them to rest long ago, it is in vain - there are many charms in the walkie-talkies that you can feel only when you use them for a while.  Firstly, the vast territory of Russia simply forces you to acquire a couple of such devices: cellular communication is far from everywhere, and if you go for mushrooms, go fishing or barbecues a little further than usual, you can risk being left without communication with the outside world in general. <br><br>  In addition, the material component is also important here.  In comparison with smartphones, walkie-talkies are much cheaper, and the only cost for the buyer to communicate with such a device is, in fact, electricity for charging its battery.  Even if you use it rarely, in the household, as they say, such a thing is always useful.  What does Xiaomi offer us?

      The handheld radio has the talker name <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/walkie-talkies/pp_615657.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Walkie-Talkie</a> , the device supports frequencies within 403-470 MHz when selecting the UHF mode.  In the VHF band, frequencies in the range of 136-174 MHz will be available to the user.  The Xiaomi walkie-talkie itself is simple, but at the same time equipped with everything you need: here is a set of buttons for control (where you can go without them), and a small display where information is displayed for setting up the walkie-talkie.  All this is equipped with a snow-white or dark gray minimalist body with a rather long antenna. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3d7/40b/af6/3d740baf6ef344b6aaeaf437240d50a3.jpg"><br><br>  Under the upper controls there was a place for a microphone, the speaker was located just below.  By the way, using this radio, you can also listen to FM-radio, there is a function of displaying short RDS messages on the screen.  The important thing here is the opportunity to share your geoposition with the interlocutor - it will help you out very much in a forest or other unfamiliar terrain, where it is very difficult to explain your location. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7b9/42c/707/7b942c7078023ba71ce99aa401956d9c.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Specifications </h2><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Wireless connection <br></td><td>  Bluetooth 4.0 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Battery capacity <br></td><td>  2 600 mAh <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Screen <br></td><td>  160 x 100, LCD, black and white <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Range <br></td><td>  10 km in open areas, 6 km in populated <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Interface <br></td><td>  micro usb <br></td></tr><tr><td>  FM radio support <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The main issue here is battery life.  Walkie-talkie with this is a complete order - up to 8 days in standby mode.  A battery with a capacity of 2,600 mAh is charged with a micro USB cable.  As for the range of work, Xiaomi claims up to 10 km in open areas and up to 6 km in a populated area where there is interference.  For most tasks that are solved with the help of walkie-talkies, this distance is more than enough. <br><br>  There are so many options for using a walkie-talkie that you will surely find one that suits you.  Do you repair?  A great way to communicate with workers, rather than overlap with a window.  The Walkie-Talkie interface is simple, even a child can handle it, so you can communicate with him, for example, being in a large house.  Walkie-talkie will be suitable for joint road trips, the speed will not deteriorate even at high speed.  Since we started talking about cars, here, by the way, the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/car-dvr/pp_615460.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Xiaomi video recorder</a> ($ 74.99) is not superfluous, especially true for Russian realities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cfb/eb4/10f/cfbeb410f5a61c5adae31d9c4cf96074.jpg"><br><br>  Well, Xiaomi would not be Xiaomi if it did not equip the radio with support for Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technology.  The radio can be configured using a special application, including viewing the location of participants on the map.  By the way, when you reach a certain volume level, you can talk without pressing the talk button, so that your hands are free. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/652/363/2dd/6523632dd07072390fa13699c639984f.jpg"><br><br>  In fact, the capabilities of this radio without any problems will be enough for both a beginner and a more advanced user.  It's nice that with the coupon <b>XMWTYY</b> (will start at 19:00 10.03 till 25.03) the cost of the device is so small that you can buy it just to be - sooner or later it will still come in handy.  Sales of Walkie-Talkie started quite recently, and on GearBest it is already <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/walkie-talkies/pp_615657.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">available for order</a> . <br><br>  It is interesting to observe how Xiaomi expands its product range.  There was already a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/ceiling-lights/pp_596249.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">lamp</a> , and <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/home-smart-improvements/pp_268522.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">air purifiers</a> , and a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_294071.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">lot of smartphones</a> , which the company produces at an enviable speed - recently I <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/286552/">introduced</a> two new items and a processor.  The main thing is that ‚Äúall devices are needed, all devices are important,‚Äù then something else is waiting for us on the line.  In the meantime, you can familiarize yourself with the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/promotion-xiaomi-phones-accessories-special-259.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">special offer on Xiaomi phones</a> , which are now available at a very good discount.
