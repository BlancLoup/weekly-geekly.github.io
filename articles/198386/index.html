  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex launches metrics for applications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today we open <a href="http://appmetrica.yandex.ru/">Metrics for apps</a> for all developers for free.  It works with iPhone, Android, Windows Phone, Windows Store, .NET.  In it, we have combined everything that they themselves would like from a tool for application developers.  First of all, a clear interface, in which there is nothing superfluous - in just a few clicks you can find the answer to any question about the audience of your applications. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/198386/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b87/8c1/7ee/b878c17ee0f9657e62ddfc3fd728788c.png" alt="image"><br></a> <br>  Reports may include any combination of the following parameters: user geographic location, application version, OS type and version, device type (tablet or smartphone), model and manufacturer, screen resolution, interface language, cellular operator, connection type, actions and user sessions. <br><br>  On the YaC mobile section, Alexander Kochubey, the project manager, spoke about Metrics for applications.  Today Sasha went to the <a href="http://www.apps-world.net/">Apps World</a> conference, so this text was not on his behalf, but he wrote it.  Read under the cat the details about what data on the work of your applications will now be available to you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yandex, like any mobile application developer, is interesting and useful to know its users.  Where do they come from, what devices do they have, what interface language do they prefer, what is their internet connection speed and how exactly do they use our applications.

      We tried many different analytical tools to study the audience, paid and free.  Some have told us the number of users of our applications in Russia.  Others went a little further - it was possible to find out from which devices and how many sessions were in Moscow.  And only a few provided the necessary data in real time. <br><br>  As a rule, it took a lot of time and effort to create complex analytical reports using these services.  We wanted to know more, receive information here and now and do it without delay.  Therefore, we have created our own tool for analyzing the audience of mobile applications. <br><br>  Since 2008, we (and since 2009, everyone) have been helped by Yandex.Metrica - it measured traffic, studied user behavior and the effectiveness of advertising on websites.  Metric is well versed in statistics, and we taught her to work not only with the web, but also with applications. <br><br>  For example, using the metrics for applications, you can find out how many new users from Moscow and St. Petersburg during the week made in-app purchases in your application version 1.01 from the Galaxy S4 smartphone: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ed/c2c/0f2/4edc2c0f2e619f7ba0180405616c9cda.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Or the number of unique users of version 1.10 of the application from Russia, who spent in the application from 30 to 60 seconds, with a breakdown by device: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/71a/af2/8b9/71aaf28b9368aee3f59f9f89b6db4227.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The metrics for applications also provides detailed reports about the crashes of your application.  Unless, of course, it falls.  For example, you can find out how many times an application version 1.02 has dropped on Russian tablets for a week from Russian unique users: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d4/fd6/b93/6d4fd6b9329dd3e00ed4aa415633a8d6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Or weekly statistics of falls on different devices: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/267/468/578/267468578c0c2d6f6b8329625ff67d4a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The application metric does not only show statistics for the past month, week, or day.  Data is updated every minute - you can monitor the use of the application almost in real time. <br><br>  To use the Metrics for applications, register at appmetrica.yandex.ru, get the api_key key and integrate the Yandex.Metricka mobile applications SDK into your application.  Reports will begin to be generated within a minute after the completion of this process. <br><br>  In the next version of the Mobile App Metrics, which we are already working on, marketing tools will appear in addition to the analytical ones.  With their help, developers will be able to see the sources of traffic, funnels, conversions and much more.  Follow the news, and if you have questions - ask them in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198386/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198386/</a></p>
