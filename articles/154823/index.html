  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why is our SEO worse than Western and what can we learn from them?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img alt="SEO Techniques" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c4c/492/b9b/c4c492b9bceffe37cc9edd088ab62c02.jpg"><br>  <strong>SEO or search engine optimization</strong> is one of the most effective and common methods of the Internet marketing system.  For many years, SEO has earned not the best reputation in runet.  It is all about the customers and the SEOs themselves to the process of website promotion.  Of course, we also have entire studios that are professionally engaged in SEO, providing a wide range of services.  But rather, you will meet a pipeline on which projects are riveted, cheap links are bought, and it‚Äôs not a fact that you will get what you expected.  In the West, the situation is different.  That is why the quality of services they have is higher, and optimizers do not complain about the salary. <br>  Let's understand what SEO is in the West, and why we are far from perfect. <br>  For this you need to get to the bottom of the problem.  Since the virtual world has one habitat for all, the human factor is crucial. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  You can't run away from yourself </h2><br><h3>  What we strive for and what they strive for </h3><br>  Do not forget that the ultimate goal of SEO - to attract customers, increase customer profits.  And the methods that are used for this are the main thing that distinguishes our ‚ÄúSEOs‚Äù from them. <br>  <strong>We have:</strong> <br>  For most of our SEO optimizers, the main goal is <strong>position in a search engine: growth and speed</strong> , all the same as - the main thing is not to be banned.  Growth is good, they earn good money on advertising.  Due attention is not paid to what users visit the site, as long as there are as many of them as possible.  Here black methods are used.  For this, no one puts, but still the Internet clogs as a result.  I do not say that this does not happen in the West - they have a different attitude. <br>  Our experts are engaged in SEO everything, scattering to different areas, clutching at everything.  For example, if you work as a ‚ÄúSEO‚Äù in a large IT company, you are engaged in content management, editing images, writing texts, and in general doing everything to bring the site into proper form. <br>  <strong>They have:</strong> <br>  Law-abiding foreigners can not afford to walk on lawn-cut, not to mention the black advance.  Links, however, still bought - where do without it.  However, Western colleagues are more inclined towards white methods (law-abiding in their blood), and clients are more interested in <strong>stable growth of the site‚Äôs position and conversion</strong> , rather than intermittent fleeting results.  They are easier to treat guarantees, relying on the reputation of the company.  The latter do not promise anything, but most often they provide a package of services that they undertake to fulfill: the number of links, articles, etc.  And as you know, they have a sacred agreement. <br>  If you are a ‚ÄúSEO‚Äù in the West, then you are a highly specialized professional, you are doing something one, gradually improving your skills. <br><h3>  Customers </h3><br>  <strong>We have:</strong> <br>  It all depends primarily on the client.  Our SEOs have to work with speed-focused clients, while providing very little money.  Well, as a result, they receive the corresponding quality in an off-white version. <br>  <strong>They have:</strong> <br>  In the West, customers are committed to quality and a long-term perspective.  And best of all - they are willing to pay for it, realizing all the risks associated with cheap SEO "in haste". <br>  <em>This does not mean that Western experts are good, and ours are immoral, they just have everything according to the rules: increasing the long-awaited conversion, creating targeted traffic, and we are used to finding convenient loopholes, methods, how to deft the search engine, cheat, circumvent established rules .</em>  <em>And small victories are more important for us than working for an old reliable reputation.</em> <br><h2>  SEO technology - sleight of hand and no cheating </h2><br>  SEO, as a marketing strategy, is unleashed to the full in the West.  The basic methods are the same as ours: meta tags, content, links, and more.  But there is one big BUT - what, how much, how, and most importantly, for whom it is used. <br><h3>  Link building </h3><br>  Here we will talk about the so-called <strong>link building strategies</strong> , which are very often used by most professional optimizers.  It is impossible to be unequivocal in this matter and forget that it is the client and his desires that form the policy of ‚ÄúSEO‚Äù. <br>  <strong>We have:</strong> <br>  Short-term strategy - <strong>Artificially building up the link mass</strong> - our specialists applied it to build up the link mass in an unnatural, but fast way: mass purchase of backlinks through exchanges, comment spam, buying links on aggregators, etc. <br>  Imagine that a client comes to you and wants his site to be in the top five on the Google search results page in a couple of months and gives you 300 bucks for everything.  Here you have to get out, as you can.  Our cunning optimizers, of course, found a way out of this situation. <br>  We turn to exchanges with unverified and sometimes harmful links.  Buying links is a paid pleasure, therefore, their quality often depends on the cost.  Links are bought in bulk for pennies on SAPE.  Temporary links are widely used by our optimizers, ‚Äúputting customers on the needle‚Äù: they must be paid constantly, because if a customer stops paying, the site‚Äôs rating immediately drops.  <strong>"Eternal" links</strong> are reliable and focused on quality, but they are more expensive.  But the main problem is the limited budget that our SEOs have. <br>  They have: <br>  <strong>Natural strategy</strong> .  Western SEOs have long been armed with a strategy of gradually increasing the reference mass as the main method of website promotion.  <strong>Natural links are</strong> especially important, and they appear only in the case of unique, relevant and interesting content.  Those who are really interested in this will link to your site. <br>  Western experts are trying to earn the trust of search engines to the site, rather than chasing positions, they are determined to take <strong>quality, not quantity</strong> .  Links are bought from them, but they must be of high quality and bring, in addition to the reference weight, useful traffic, and therefore cost ten times more.  There are, of course, poor-quality links, but they do not particularly rely on them.  In the future, quality links bring much more dividends than low-quality ones. <br>  <strong>Guest blogging</strong> .  This method has received recognition from Europeans and Americans and has long been used to effectively promote the site.  After all, it is based on high-quality content that you sell for links to blogs. <br>  <strong>Exchange of articles, crossposting</strong> .  Such methods are still quite widespread among Western colleagues.  Although worth noting that the time has passed for their widespread use.  In the case of backlinks, Western experts have recently set up quite seriously.  Many webmasters are ready to even sue for poor-quality links to their sites. <br>  However, nothing prevents the exchange of articles with reliable large sites.  Also blogging, question and answer in Google Groups, Yahoo!  Answers - all this is widely and successfully used both in the West and in our country. <br><h3>  SMM </h3><br>  <strong>We have:</strong> <br>  SMM (Social Media Marketing) is already actively used by many domestic SEOs, but as you know, there is no trodden road and much has to be discovered by ourselves.  I think in a few years it will be even more widespread. <br>  <strong>They have:</strong> <br>  Western colleagues pay great attention to the promotion of sites in social networks, establishing contacts with potential customers.  This is a whole industry.  Everything is logical: the world is transferred to the Internet, and the social network is the market in which everything is bought and sold. <br><h3>  Content </h3><br>  <strong>We have:</strong> <br>  Let's talk about such seemingly small things as content.  Our copywriters are limited in resources, which means they follow a common policy: the faster and cheaper, the better.  Updating the site is very important in promotion, and the content must be not only unique, but also interesting.  If you order cheap texts, the quality will be appropriate. <br>  <strong>They have:</strong> <br>  In the West, content is approached very seriously, and if an SEO copywriter takes up the topic, he is provided with all the necessary information and the topic is covered in full.  Copywriters sweat over the texts, trying not only to fill the site with content, but to write a selling text, interesting and relevant.  This helps to attract new customers, increase the duration of the visitor's stay on the site and, as a result, increases the site rating. <br><h3>  Keyword </h3><br>  We have: <br>  I think each of us has come across a situation where you type a phrase into a search engine, click on the first link, and there‚Äôs nothing like it and it doesn‚Äôt smell like solid trash.  <strong>Spam, doorways, cloaking</strong> are still <strong>littering the Internet,</strong> but this, unfortunately, is still working.  Of course, search engines are trying to fight this, and lately the rules have tightened, but the network is still littered with the fruits of black SEO. <br>  <strong>They have:</strong> <br>  Most Western colleagues in this issue are more advanced, they have other goals, budgets and, as a result, results.  C semantic core begins optimization of the site and its subsequent promotion.  Key words should correspond to the content, their set is carefully considered, because the effectiveness of website promotion will depend on it. <br>  It‚Äôs a very common opinion that if there were no SEO, life on the Internet would be easier and cleaner.  For some reason this is true, but SEO already exists, one helps, others hinder.  <strong>SEO is not a science, everything is relative</strong> .  What is good for one SEO or for a specific client may be unacceptable or ineffective for others. <br>  Today it is impossible to deny the need for SEO, its wide distribution and a clear development.  Even if you have a very useful and cool site, you will score far and for a long time without its promotion in search engines.  It is necessary to improve SEO, as a technology of marketing, introducing new methods, adopting the experience of foreign colleagues, moving to a new level.  <strong>Without this, the runet will remain a dump in which you have to look for something useful among a mountain of garbage</strong> . </div>
