New Year is on the nose, and you will definitely want to please yourself (or not yourself) with something, and perhaps today I will help you with a choice.  I had two samples of headphones from the Creative model range 2013-2014 in use: the SoudBlaster EVO Wireless gaming headset and Aurvana Live! 2 ‚Äúaudiophile‚Äù, I will tell you about them today. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/359/98a/119/35998a119ccbd41723a7ec9bc0686165.jpg" alt="9ecUwrI.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Ruler Aurvana </h4><br>  The updated series contains three models, two of which can work without wires (Platinum and Gold).  Live! 2 is deprived of such a possibility, and is, in fact, a reprint of the rather popular model Aurvana Live! .. In fact, Gold and Platinum with Live! 2 have only a common triangle in design.  Live! 2, in turn, interests us with interesting ‚Äúguts‚Äù that it got from the Japanese manufacturer Foster, and its main goal is to promote the Aurvana line itself, and older models got a large number of electronic chips, though their price is still beyond comfortable for most music lovers.  The main differences between the models can be counted on the fingers: <br><br>  First, Gold and Platinum can connect via Bluetooth with support for high-quality audio compression algorithm.

It is called Multi Point: it allows you to connect one headphone to two audio sources and switch between them.  Very nice little things, even if not used every day at 100%. <br><br>  The NFC support became a bonus of the new series: they brought the smartphone to the ‚Äúear‚Äù, he turned on the BT himself, turned on the phone (or just connected), and the music started playing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/22a/c27/496/22ac27496f9507f99cb05fae2b4a5ad5.jpg"><br><br>  Third, both older models support active noise cancellation (Platinum has as many as three noise modes: indoor, plane and street noise), and the noise level works both for audio playback and for subtracting garbage from the microphone signal. <br><br>  Fourth, both models are not deprived of the opportunity to work from classical sound sources - audio connectors of 3.5 and 6.5 millimeters.  In case you don't trust bluetooth with your FLACs with Beethoven and Mozart, well, or if you have a battery. <br><br>  The main difference between Gold and Platinum is the size of the radiator.  Gold got a speaker with a diameter of 40 millimeters, Platinum - 50, both with neodymium magnets. <br><br>  And now the main catch of the party: of all three models, Aurvana received only the most ‚Äúsimple‚Äù version of Live! 2 received Biocellulose membranes.  You can read more about this audiophile stumble at the corresponding resources, I will say only one thing - the Japanese company Foster (the OEM manufacturer of these speakers) ate the dog for them and is considered one of the best manufacturers of dynamic emitters.  Thus, for a modest 150-200 dollars you can get very, very decent headphones that (purely hypothetically) can even give a more decent sound than much more expensive Gold and Platinum. <br><br><h4>  EVO line </h4><br>  Headphones (or rather, a headset) belong to the ‚Äúgaming‚Äù line, in which, in addition to the test version, there are three more models: the base EVO, deprived of wireless functions, and two older versions of the EVO Zx and ZxR. <br><br>  In accordance with the concept of the line as an accessory for gamers, models have the appropriate design and software features.  All four models (EVO, Evo Wireless, Evo Zx and ZxR) are able to connect to a computer via USB cable (visible in the system as a separate sound card), the older three, in addition to this, are able to work via BlueTooth.  The classic ‚ÄúMini-Jack‚Äù has not gone anywhere, in this EVO they look like Aurvana, about which - a bit later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/549/8e3/e48/5498e3e48577717e05be3417e30bbc56.jpg"><br><br>  Two older models (Zx, ZxR) have built-in AAX audio chips, you can enjoy all the charms of SBX Studio software with a wireless connection, special software is available in app stores on both iOS and Android.  The younger ones did not get such a luxury, so the software buns are only via USB. <br><br>  In addition, the older model (ZxR) has a built-in active noise cancellation system (similar to that used in top-end Aurvana), and the speaker, I think, is the same inside: ZxR - 50mm, Zx (Z and EVO) - 40mm . <br><br><h4>  Aurvana Live! 2 - delicious sound at a tasty price </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d35/9bb/936/d359bb9369496306bb501db696b0ad59.jpg" alt="WeLM7y.jpg"><br><br>  Perhaps, it‚Äôs worth starting with the model with the characteristics declared by the manufacturer: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Type</b> : Closed full-size headphones <br></li><li>  <b>Weight</b> : 255g <br></li><li>  Emitters <b>diameter and material</b> : 40mm, biocellulose; <br></li><li>  <b>Reproducible frequency range</b> : 10Hz ~ 30KHz <br></li><li>  <b>Cable Length</b> : 1.2m / 3.9ft <br></li><li>  <b>Microphone</b> : Frequency range: 100Hz ~ 10kHz;  Sensitivity: - 42dBV <br></li></ul><br><br>  We will not swear about who, how and how measures the range of reproduced frequencies, each manufacturer has its own policies and oppression of its own line, and we are not discussing here kilohertz, but the sound from the headphones. <br><br>  The headset comes in a large convenient box, I will not mention the complete set of the Tsar, but there is everything you need - an adapter cable with a microphone, a case, headphones, an instruction manual.  The headphones themselves are made of matte plastic with metal inserts in the headband, it itself, (like the ear cushions), is upholstered with a very soft and pleasant tactile material that looks like leather. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6cf/453/d8f/6cf453d8fbebe411aa4153c53cb08915.jpg" alt="17xeiglmP.jpg"><br><br>  The emitters are protected by a plastic frame from accidental damage, from dust / crumbs / trifles protects the microfiber coating.  Both cups have a hinge that allows you to turn them ~ 5-10 degrees "towards you" and ~ 90 degrees away from you.  It is useful when transporting, and even adapt to the head.  A flat cable with a microphone and analog volume control connects to the right ‚Äúcup‚Äù.  Actually, nothing can be said about the design and the case itself: they are comfortable, light enough, they hold up well on the head, the ears are not squeezed, they are not tight on the top of head, what else do you need?  Let's go to the sound? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c26/bc7/87b/c26bc787b9aa378be22ab56f303c48b9.jpg" alt="2l4sG9Wz.jpg"><br><br>  It just so happened that in the circle of my friends and acquaintances there are not so many audiographers ... people with a huge budget for auditing, but, nevertheless, they are.  I saw, touched and heard a bunch of different headphones, including models for quite inhumane 35-40 thousand rubles like the <a href=""><u>Sennheiser D800</u></a> , and in general I have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow the test works should sound like they should be produced in decent quality from a good audio source.  Impressions from the AL! 2 words are difficult to convey, yet, sound is sound, and the text remains text, but ... For its price range (up to 10 thousand ever-wooden), low-frequency transmission - to a solid five with a minus (there is light "warmth" in the bass , the sound is detailed and juicy, there is no membrane shattering or bouncing in the minute), medium ones - on the top five (just great sound), high ones - again, five minus (I want to crush the EQ a little for excessive ‚Äúsonority‚Äù, although this is a matter of personal preference and perception / physiology / biology of the individual will listen  spruce). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ce/c4e/e4d/9cec4ee4dbc0c8bdc649657ea8f85ad8.jpg" alt="ghcRerLN.jpg"><br><br>  The model has very balanced characteristics: jazz sounds good in it, it is pleasant to listen to rock compositions and classical vocals, films and games sound great.  Lovers of brain-tolerant tots-tots-oz-oz and spoiling the enamel bass in some rapchina, of course, should go straight to the camp of all sorts of beats that are designed for this audience: AL! 2, rather, it is designed for music in its more classical understanding and sharpened by a balanced reproduction of the entire available frequency range. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d7/7c5/26d/2d77c526df30bb3126eabd3f28d7a704.jpg" alt="ZnXRpzK.jpg"><br><br>  In conjunction with mid-priced players or smartphones equipped with high-quality audio (such as LG G2 or Meizu with their player past), most likely, more expensive headphones will be commonplace Overkill - you will not see changes in sound quality.  And on lower-end player models and on ordinary smartphones, of course, the sound quality will improve, but they are unlikely to be able to fully unleash the potential of AL! 2, however, any feeling of ‚Äúunderstatement‚Äù in the form of a blockage of frequencies or a ‚Äúcutoff‚Äù of the frequency range you will not see: there are no millet software chips in AL! 2, they play what comes into the incoming audio jack. <br><br>  Many foreign reviewers cite more expensive options from Denon in comparison with this model, since the same speakers with exactly the same characteristics are inside, but I deliberately avoid this issue - I did not listen to the mentioned Denon models, although I believe that the differences minimal or absent altogether. <br><br><h4>  Evo wireless </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f4/842/88e/2f484288e92abde75e18a1508e603a24.jpg" alt="loQV48B13.jpg"><br><br>  It so happens that the ‚Äúkinematics‚Äù, the shape of the body and the final construction are very similar to those used in Aurvana Live! 2 - whether it is standardized or it is difficult to come up with something better for 40 mm emitters, but the fact remains.  The same turn of the cups, the same materials in the face of plastic and metal parts in the headband, the same soft ear cushions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20e/6b8/375/20e6b83750719cc9f2fc3db9ae382b35.jpg" alt="xLDjFw1.jpg"><br><br>  The design is made in a ‚Äúgame‚Äù style: I don‚Äôt know how anyone, but I prefer the severity of Aurvana, or Razer, who don‚Äôt think that a gaming device or accessory should glow like a good Christmas tree.  No, headphones look nice and never seem cheap, but for some reason all manufacturers believe that if you are positioned for gamers, you can‚Äôt do without backlighting, red or bright blue, strange glossy surfaces or chrome inserts.  Fortunately, there are not many glossy parts on the EVO, and the red one is more or less the theme, but I would prefer the classic black (in extreme cases with silver or white parts) model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e4c/743/085/e4c743085f9403e90bc026457a52f1b9.jpg" alt="0Xi5uq.jpg"><br><br>  WIreless is a junior wireless model, it does not have its own audio processor, which would allow using all software gadgets over a wireless connection, but it is possible to use them via a USB connection.  Among the wireless functionality - NFC (now tell you why) and Bluetooth (I understand why, to transfer audio). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f0c/41e/ebc/f0c41eebc5a1b70c8186bf0aaa779658.jpg" alt="PLTj23.jpg"><br><br>  NFC in the headphones is present in the form of an active tag: if you have a smartphone or tablet that has the appropriate technology on board, you can simply bring it to your ear, after which the headphones turn on themselves, go into pairing or connection mode, and your smartphone He will turn on Bluetooth himself, find the headphones and create a bundle with them (connect if there is already a bundle).  One action instead of the monotonous "turned on the headphones - turned on the bluetooth on the phone - found it in the list of devices - picked up."  Of course, the Yabloko in the span and connect as before. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b43/405/1c8/b434051c812530a0129b02d0ce86bb73.jpg" alt="UgBrWw6.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the headphones - the usual 40-mm emitters (no bio-cellulose), built-in microphone, battery, and, in fact, everything.  A little later I will try to get the top version of Aurvana and Evo for the test, there are many interesting features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c1/0d2/7f5/8c10d27f519d2ae03d2b5089104dd76c.jpg" alt="grtCXfo8nR.jpg"><br><br>  There is not much to say about the sound quality - a solid four on all fronts.  Prior to Aurvana Live! 2, it doesn‚Äôt fall short: the headphones (or rather, headsets) have clearly shifted priorities to the area of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúimproving‚Äù: sonorous high frequencies, middle and juicy lower ones filled with details, I want to subdue and align, which, however, goes by the wayside, if not compare Evo with AL! 2 directly, changing one to another.  By themselves, they give excellent sound both on the wire and without it, they work on batteries for quite a long time (and in the case of a discharge, you can always switch to the classic 3.5 millimeters), besides, they do not weigh much, they do not burden your head and do not squeeze. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5d/bb7/e6c/f5dbb7e6c27db2b36747783d265d4591.jpg" alt="FqAZTHSG.jpg"><br><br>  Very pleased with the work of the microphone: no extension bar, but the interlocutor could hear me much better than in many other headsets or with a directional microphone, a good webcam: a clear and clear voice and a minimum of extraneous sounds.  Thanks to the "game" origin: voice communication in many cyber disciplines plays an important role, and here she is a success. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/197/1ea/375/1971ea375ee3950ba95e663919f24c4b.jpg" alt="8dQPlX.jpg"><br><br>  Since we are talking about gaming features, it is impossible not to mention the special Scout Mode included in the SoundBlaster control panels: loud sounds become quieter, but the quiet noises, on the contrary, increase.  If you like tactical shooters, sit in ambush with a rifle or stick to a dark corner without a flashlight and LCC - a feature for you, other players are gamers.  The enemy will not pass.  Of course, if the sounds of walking and other rustling provided igrodelami. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5a/229/733/f5a2297333dee177f1bf4eb1f8aa699a.jpg" alt="NRdPwB.jpg"><br><br>  Boost midrange in voice mode is also very helpful - to make out the words in the riot of explosions, machine-gun bursts and diesel tarahtenya in the tank _ really_ simple.  To summarize? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31b/bc9/4f8/31bbc94f8fb2e14a35ed8491810abc46.jpg" alt="ru4zoBPxq.jpg"><br><br><h4>  What, how much, why </h4><br>  <b>AurvanaLive! 2</b> - definitely one of the best headphones for ‚Äúordinary‚Äù music for your money.  Very detailed and pleasant sound, maximum comfort with constant wear, minimum weight.  Foreign surveyors praise, on the Doctorhead modelk forum, all the bones have already been washed, they <a href="http://personalaudio.ru/detail/creative_aurvana_live_2/"><u>have</u></a> already <a href="http://personalaudio.ru/detail/creative_aurvana_live_2/"><u>done a</u></a> test on personalaudio.ru, and they also praise the modelku.  If you have a good player or mobile phone with a high-quality hardware decoder, and the FLAC audio collection - take a look, listen, if there is a desire - get one.  My headphones are very pleased.  Price - in the area from 5 to 6 thousand rubles: not to say that it is cheap, but they are 100% worth of money, giving a light to many models for which they ask for 10, 11 and 12. In addition, it can be used as a headset , the microphone on the standard wire is there and works fine.  Not EVO, of course, but still worthy. <br><br>  <b>EVO Wireless</b> is a gaming model to the bone.  Improvers allow you to snatch crumbs of advantage over an enemy who does not use ‚Äúhardware / software cheats,‚Äù as a headset, the model works ten points out of five, when connected to a mobile phone, it produces a good sound, and the one-touch wireless connection is very pleasing : Now it is as easy to connect as plugging the plug into the phone, only you don‚Äôt need to plug in anything.  The price tag is completely for wireless ears with such a set of features - about 6.5 - 7 kilorubles. <br><br>  I hope my short review will be to someone, yes useful.  Holiday greetings. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207806/">https://habr.com/ru/post/207806/</a></p>
