      I welcome, love, respect and honor Android, Windows and other mobile operating systems.  The richer the market, the better for everyone.  It would never occur to me to think about the owners of BlackBerry or LG G Flex, that they show off with their phones - but as soon as it comes to Apple, everyone seems to be breaking the chain.  "Be-ee, the herd" or "Ha," Samsung "still sells better!" Stop on one thing, go ... <br><br>  Apple has created a lot of innovation, but being a pioneer in the market has never been the company's goal: the iPod was not the first MP3 player, and the iPhones were late with multitasking.  ‚ÄúWe wanted to wait until we could ensure the best multitasking work on the smartphone in the world,‚Äù said Steve Jobs, presenting iOS 4 in 2010, and no one doubted that his team had successfully achieved this. <br><br>  As for the size - many owners of "Androids" noted how late the company from Cupertino entered into the bout of diagonals.  But again, Apple was just waiting for the moment when the processor power, battery endurance, screen resolution, case materials and the OS environment match perfectly.  The point is not to be first - the point is to be the best. <br><br>  And the iPhone 6 with a diagonal of 4.7 ", and 6 Plus with 5.5" is lighter than the fifth (which was the same size as the fourth) iPhone: with a higher display resolution, more powerful, but with the same running time from batteries for all measurements.  Fitness comes to the fore: the appearance of the barometer in the phone allows applications to distinguish height, lift, stairs and other sports parameters. <br><br>  These phones - silver, gold or "space gray" - are extremely pleasing to both the hand and the eye.  They are released along with the superb iOS 8 ‚Äî forward for the iPhone and iPad, fortunately backwards compatible with 4S. <br><br>  The incomparable design and innovation team of Johnny Ive, who hired Apple's brilliant Australian designer Mark Newson (to whom I once spilled some of this horrible drink of green wheat grass and spirulina, otherwise it would all go to P Diddy <i>(I have no idea what he is comment per.)</i> ) - released the most exquisite in appearance, by weight and to the touch devices.  I have been using both for a week now and cannot decide which one to leave. <br><br>  They both offer an amazing Retina HD display.  Plus has more pixels and (indeed) an advantage of the optical stabilization system over the digital one.  Full HD camera allows you to shoot horribly cool slow-mo at 720p, turning us all into directors of The Matrix.  In my big hands, the 5.5-inch 6 Plus is absolutely perfect, but for most users I would still recommend a six.  I am now typing text on each of them faster than I could have imagined. <br><br>  Keyboard with predictive input ‚Äî open to developers for refinement ‚Äî can only be improved by companies such as the British SwiftKey, which has already achieved tremendous success with Android, adding to the iOS apps their full personal vocabulary that allows you to type as Dickens or Dr. Johnson or Dre.  Should I talk about an extraordinary Wi-Fi call option that allows you to have a conversation using your home or work Wi-Fi and continue it without interruptions outside Wi-Fi access in LTE (4G) networks (EE in the case of Britain) without connecting voice LTE. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5a/086/85a/a5a08685ab89475481f7dab1c537154c.jpg"><br>  <i><a href="http://www.stephenfry.uk/2014/09/17/apple-hit-successive-sixes/">Stephenfry.uk</a> blog <a href="http://www.stephenfry.uk/2014/09/17/apple-hit-successive-sixes/">illustration</a></i> <br><br>  This is quite enough for me to confidently predict that these phones will prove their sales, I think, technical and visual superiority over everything that has so far been created in the market of mobile devices.  Sue me  if i'm wrong  And, of course, look at Apple Watch ... <br><br>  <i>* The author of the translation also sinned with something similar in 2010, when he wrote the article " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/82273/">Goodbye, Karma, or Who Needs an iPad?</a> "</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237111/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237111/</a></p>
