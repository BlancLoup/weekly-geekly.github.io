So let's not be white crows and do bookkeeping.  Total: blogs and hamsters rule the world!  Very life-affirming and expected results.  Congratulations!  Keep it up!  I propose that the new year be considered the year of the Rectangular Blog.  And there are no other blogs. <br><br>  I will begin this review with the blogs that exist in LiveJournal.  As always, there is a lot of interest.

      Even when I was a high school student, the books ‚ÄúA brief summary of works on the subject‚Äú Literature ‚Äùbegan to appear.  Disgusting, of course, but some used them, even the works from there blew out cleanly.  To the current generation of schoolchildren, judging by the following link, even such neutered versions are too lazy to read.  So, the boy asks for a <a href="http://livejournal.com/community/ru_lit/299815.html">brief summary of Donki-hota</a> specifically for him (I hope the editor will not correct the title).  In response, he receives retellings already on five pages, in which there are adventures of a hot ass, and French Minister La Manch, who made a delicate move in negotiations with Greece, and ... Read for yourself.  I note only that so far no one has indicated the mistake of the boy.  Have fun. <br><br>  Yevgeny Gorzhaltsan in his LiveJournal arranges an exhibition of the <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/zuhel/370787.html">Sino-Japanese social poster</a> .  15 original posters are accompanied by copyright couplets.  Although, some images break all ideas about social poster and without accompanying text.  Shocking Asia. <br><br>  Pre-New Year's days clearly awakened in the authors poetic talent.  For example, a mosmellowman composed a verse with the saying title ‚Äú <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/mosmellowman/46797.html">Why did you delete your LJ?</a>  ‚Äú.  Naturally, in the comments immediately appeared variations on this topic.  And the notorious among the Zhuzyuzov speaking stool the Buek gave out a mocking almost poem ‚Äú <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/buek/93286.html">A little more about the Journal!</a>  ‚Äú.  I can not give you quotes from this netenka, because the mat on the mat and the point here is not at all in chess. <br><br>  There are many actors who were popular ten or twenty years ago, and today almost no one remembers them.  However, there are movie lovers who find out what happened to the once beloved actors?  So, andrey_g has prepared a note about <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/andrey_g/43384.html">Vladimir Shevelkov</a> , who, first of all, is known as Midshipman Olenev.  He also starred in such famous films as "The Adventures of Prince Florizel" and "The Train Out of Schedule".  It is also interesting to read his opinion on contemporary domestic cinema and why he stopped filming. <br><br>  Strange and at the same time pretty everyday photo placed in his diary mi3ch.  Three children <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/mi3ch/682913.html">play "Monopoly"</a> .  Here is just one of them almost naked lying on the nails.  Not child porn. <br><br>  And the last number in our performance about LiveJournal will be a link to an article that may take you several hours.  Idavirus collected <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/idavirus/190614.html">all the interesting</a> , in his opinion, notes that he came across in LiveJournal.  Enumerate all does not make sense.  There is both a useful educational program (" <i>Who is who in Russian</i> <i>-speaking</i> <i>LJ</i> ") and violent propaganda (" <i>Let's hit the decadence on LJ-sny jargon</i> "). This collection of links is united by one common factor - all the records are related to LJ. It's nice there I found the mention of my diary :). <br><br>  The review flows smoothly from the LJ pages to the personal blog pages.  Do not ask me, what's the difference between them - we will quarrel. <br><br>  On this occasion, I have for you and read immediately found.  And what is great is everything in one blog - <a href="http://antiweblogger.blogspot.com/"><b>ZOO Magazine</b></a> .  To start thinking <a href="http://antiweblogger.blogspot.com/2005/12/blog-post_20.html">about PR, samopiare and antipiar</a> blogs.  An article with a twinkle and a face-eating scandal.  But the author does not limit himself in anything and continues to burn the verb.  And the next day, it gives a small <a href="http://antiweblogger.blogspot.com/2005/12/blog-post_113516846505284887.html">study</a> of social networking sites, and in a completely asocial style.  And he finishes readers with the <a href="http://antiweblogger.blogspot.com/2005/12/blog-post_26.html">dialogue</a> overheard on the Web, here is a small quote: " <i>How everything was beautiful and fun before. It was only we who wrote. It was just us that was read. I rushed around into the light of day. They commented on it quietly and everything</i> ."  Surely parents were called to school. <br><br>  <a href="http://maulnet.net/"><b>Stop Me If You Think</b></a> with a small note about how he was asked <a href="http://maulnet.net/%3Fp%3D92">to borrow</a> .  By the way, it is not clear whether he gave? <br><br>  <a href="http://www.sellme.ru/"><b>Sell ‚Äã‚ÄãMe</b></a> decided to make a New Year's gift to marketers (who is this ear-nose-throat?) And published two of their own charts on the themes " <a href="http://www.sellme.ru/2005/12/24/pyat_luchshih_knig_po_marketingu_2005_goda">Five Best Marketing Books of 2005</a> " and " <a href="http://www.sellme.ru/2005/12/25/tri_luchshih_instrumenta_marketologa_2005_goda">Three Best Marketing Tools of 2005</a> ".  Since these reviews are read only by marketers, they will be incredibly interested in these two notes. <br><br>  <a href="http://evilbot.ru/"><b>EvilBot</b></a> continues his reflections <a href="http://evilbot.ru/article/104">on free software</a> .  In this post, he tries to convince me and you that the "free" is not always bad.  We are surrounded by a great many good free things. <br><br>  <a href="http://boris.lifanovsky.com/"><b>Boris Lifanovsky has</b></a> attended to the forum of his site began to <a href="http://boris.lifanovsky.com/index.php%3Fitemid%3D130">bring economic benefits</a> .  Of course, the author is not going to earn millions (or is he still going to?), But he thinks it is quite possible to achieve self-sufficiency.  And in this article, Boris shares with us the conclusions he came to. <br><br>  In the corporate blog " <a href="http://company.yandex.ru/blog/"><b>Yandex</b></a> " merry note " <a href="">With the letter" I "on the copper plaque</a> ."  It seems that they all there are obsessed with the letter "I".  By the way, for general development, the most beloved letter for most Russian-speaking people is ‚ÄúY‚Äù. <br><br>  How can I stay away from the premiere of the series ‚ÄúThe Master and Margarita‚Äù?  Opinion about the film will not express until I wait for the end, but I recommend to read something - "The <a href="http://falcons.ru/mm-s-tochki-zreniya-rpg">Master and Margarita from the RPG point of view</a> ."  And for reference, the quote: "The <i>cat Behemoth is a permanent illusion, induced by a magician who specializes in the school of illusions.</i> " <br><br>  In continuation of the topic, the blog " <a href="http://ouch.kiev.ua/"><b>Details</b></a> " offers its <a href="http://ouch.kiev.ua/2005-12-22/376.html">casting of actors</a> for this series.  And the director with the author of the music is completely different. <br><br>  Women - how much sizzling consonants in this word!  Sometimes the problems that start to worry them (women) seem a bit strange.  Yes that I am, in fact, very strange.  Here <a href="http://kastorka.com/"><b>Kastorka is</b></a> trying to answer the question "The <a href="http://kastorka.com/archives/2005/12/23/308">size of the breast affects the intelligence of a woman?</a> ".  In the world every day there are terrorist attacks, until the New Year there are a few days, the trolley buses are beating with electricity, and someone compares the size of the mammary glands and brains!  Guys, you did not ask the question: "Does the size of a bank account influence libido?" <br><br>  <a href="http://hvost.org/"><b>HvosT</b></a> helps to <a href="http://hvost.org/%3Fp%3D155">convert</a> some of the PocketPC files to a standard IBM-compatible computer (and this was the only way computers used to call computers!). <br><br>  <a href="http://inforedesign.com/"><b>Denis Perehrest</b></a> , who is also inforedesign, was preoccupied with <a href="http://inforedesign.com/2005/12/20/rss-metaniya">choosing a new feed reader</a> , he is also an aggregator (my favorite and beloved).  Both software aggregators and web-based are considered.  In addition, a lot of advice in the comments.  So, if you also have not yet decided how to use the aggregator (shame on your head!), Follow the link and participate in the discussion. <br><br>  <a href="http://maxim.shipachev.ru/"><b>The Observation Diary</b></a> shares with us an image of a truly <a href="http://maxim.shipachev.ru/2005/10/10">invisible counter</a> . <br><br>  And <a href="http://live.julik.nl/"><b>julik live</b></a> tells and shows the flexibility of <a href="http://live.julik.nl/2005/12/sorta-flexible">searching for Aeroflot flights</a> .  I wonder what they smoke? <br><br>  I am amazed at " <a href="http://superkino.ru/"><b>Filmblog</b></a> ", in which for a month now not a word about cinema.  But there are plenty of other interesting notes.  Once the modern children of first-graders were asked to draw a picture according to Pushkin's quatrain, it <a href="http://superkino.ru/vsyakoe/pro-detey-i-slova">turned out to be an apocalypse</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://michael.mindmix.ru/"><b>Mikhail Monashev</b></a> leads in his blog a <a href="http://michael.mindmix.ru/3-795-v-zhivote-beremennoi-zhenschiny.zhtml">dialogue of two babies</a> in the womb.  I do not, Michael, recorded? <br><br>  <a href="http://usabilist.de/seeking/ru/new-features-of-blog-interface-design">New features</a> in the blog interface, which are opened for us thanks to web2.0, are discussed by Luke Wroblewski, and the ‚Äú <a href="http://usabilist.de/seeking/ru"><b>Looking for Usability</b></a> ‚Äù blog translates into Russian. <br><br>  Congratulations to all readers of blogs with the upcoming New Year!  I hope that in the coming year there will be many interesting author blogs that I will be happy to review, and you will be happy to read. <br><br>  Your personal aggregator <b>Alexey Kaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2005520605.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ52, 2005)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288028/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288028/</a></p>
