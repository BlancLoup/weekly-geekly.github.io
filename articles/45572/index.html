  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How not to get a job</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you are not taken officially when <u>applying</u> for a job, <u>ask for a contract</u> to write down what you should do, when you need it, and when you should get paid for it. <br>  If you are applying for a job officially, give your employment record only in exchange for an employment contract. <br>  Otherwise, instead of working, you will think about whether you will be paid or not or maybe even worse ... <br><br>  More than a month ago, I unsuccessfully got a web programmer at one St. Petersburg company.  At first everything went fine, I was given a TK, I almost made a website for half a month on this assignment, I was paid 15,000 rubles in my hands without witnesses, though 2,000 of them turned out to be fake.  Then it became really bad, the chief stopped giving intelligible tasks, and only cursed that I was not doing anything (I worked at home). <br><br>  After I was not paid the promised salary for the second part of the month, and I was tired of listening to the chief‚Äôs insults, I said that I didn‚Äôt want to work with them anymore and decided to write a letter of resignation.  I was told that the application is not necessary to write, because  they didn't make me out.  They also said that the work book will be given to me only after I redo the site or return 15,000 p.  I refused to return the money, but asked them for a clear statement of work on the site alteration, as  It was not clear from the abuse of the boss what exactly I should do.  The boss promised to send the task "tomorrow".  It will last more than half a month tomorrow.

      I already wanted to write a statement to the DAEC and under the control of the police to pay 15,000 for the return of labor, but now one boss went abroad, and the second boss talks to me more by phone - hangs up if I call.  Apparently, neither money nor work they no longer need. <br>  I went to the labor inspectorate and the prosecutor's office.  In the labor inspectorate, they didn‚Äôt talk to me at all;  I do not have an employment contract.  The prosecutor's office told me that e-mail correspondence is not proof of an employment relationship.  I am also afraid that if any bodies are involved in violators, they may even throw out my work force (I have no evidence that I gave them a work record), and in this book my entire work record since 1978 <br><br>  PS After searching for information on violating firms on the Internet, it turned out that 2 firms were involved.  I wrote the application for admission to the head of the 1st company and gave him my workplace (I don‚Äôt know where exactly, and who is currently at work).  Also, the head of the first company told me that he didn‚Äôt care where I would go and he would give the labor only if the head of the 2nd company told him about it.  Namely, the head of the 2nd company gave me tasks and paid for me. <br>  PPS Now I just do not know what to do? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45572/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45572/</a></p>
