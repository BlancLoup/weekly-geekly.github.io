As a rule, all attempts end on copying the appearance of devices of past generations.  But bb-Mobile decided to make a knight's move and presented us a device that almost completely copies the design of the iPad Air, is inexpensive and has a budget filling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ae/566/aef/6ae566aef3e94f28abffc062b28cb32b.JPG"><br><br>  This is not the first such experience for this manufacturer.  For example, bb-Mobile Techno 7.85 3G is a clone of the previous generation iPad Mini.  But there is also its own development, for example, bb-Mobile Techno 9.0 3G.  All products are of good quality, as well as proven, classic lines.  Tablets can not boast of high performance, but their capabilities are quite enough, and the price of all products is not very biting.

The bb-mobile Techno 9.7 3G tablet is based on a MediaTek MT8382 quad-core processor with a clock speed of 1.3 GHz, 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of internal flash memory, and a microSD memory card slot of up to 32 GB.  The capacity of the built-in battery is 6,000 mAh. <br><br>  The tablet has a set of wireless modules - Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, 3G.  The modem for cellular networks is designed not only for data transmission, but also for voice communication and SMS exchange.  Among other features of the tablet, I note the camera at 0.3 and 5 megapixels, as well as Android version 4.2.2 Jelly Bean. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe1/2cf/627/fe12cf627631c626104bcf788ffc6644.png" alt="image">  <b>Screen:</b> 9.7 ", 1024 x 768 px, HD, IPS <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/806/871/aac/806871aac785f1ac7a45fe2360d5ef7a.png" alt="image">  <b>Processor:</b> MediaTek MT8382 (Cortex-A7, 1.3 GHz, 4 cores) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf7/d69/613/cf7d6961340b5b16fa821567a8cdb089.png" alt="image">  <b>Video accelerator:</b> Mali-400 MP2 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ed/145/aaa/7ed145aaabcfa9106c6be7a26f087b92.png" alt="image">  <b>Operating system:</b> Android 4.2.2 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08f/b11/4cf/08fb114cf05af12329a682c7d179d012.png" alt="image">  <b>RAM:</b> 1 GB <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/487/aaf/2c0/487aaf2c012384e1cf135a561ba6a5f0.png" alt="image">  <b>User memory:</b> 8 GB + microSD slot <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb8/0be/398/cb80be398f5ff56284fa2b3191102593.png" alt="image">  <b>Camera:</b> 5 MP rear, 0.3 MP front <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/384/f20/77c/384f2077c76f50d971aa0fe534b5ca3e.png" alt="image">  <b>Connectivity:</b> GSM / GPRS / EDGE + UMTS / HSPA + <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cce/212/125/cce21212518144071cb410c070f452dc.png" alt="image">  <b>Optional:</b> GPS, A-GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, OTG, accelerometer, gyroscope, compass <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f0/8d9/6c5/1f08d96c5889f650144a0d8e30a2b5bc.png" alt="image">  <b>Battery:</b> 6000 mAh <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d6/598/1a8/0d65981a80a55a05019aba9215d64193.png" alt="image">  <b>Dimensions:</b> 240 x 169 x 7.9 mm <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2f/bfb/235/b2fbfb235eb524cec4c6508c5931bc2b.png" alt="image">  <b>Weight:</b> 586 grams <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ff/846/60d/8ff84660d5cb791a7c7859d2127051b6.png" alt="image">  <b>Price:</b> 7 990 rubles <br><br>
<h2>  <font color="E97784">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">PACKING AND COMPLETE SET</font> </h2><br>  The device comes in a carton box with a typical bb-mobile design that looks more like candy packaging.  On the front side, there is no information about the device, except for its name. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60b/154/691/60b1546911a64dc0b0484df29cae7a90.JPG"><br><br>  All information is on the sides.  On the bottom side there is some information about the "stuffing". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/889/84d/bf6/88984dbf663d42b997217aa193a8ca01.JPG"><br><br>  On the right - about which applications, besides the standard ones, are preinstalled.  Some of them are useful (for example, Navitel Navigator), the rest are unlikely to please anyone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14d/86a/81e/14d86a81ebca486e8208a6d450a58405.JPG"><br><br>  On the left - some legal information.  It's nice that they told in detail about the origin of the tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b09/599/213/b095992139334a539e4ba1220bad5aa2.JPG"><br><br>  Behind the lonely located logo of the manufacturer and the name of the device.  We also once again decided to inform that bb-Mobile Techno 9.7 3G is a tablet computer.  The packaging is well made, the cardboard is very dense.  So if you order a device on the Internet, you can not worry about its safety during delivery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cdc/16d/eef/cdc16deef99a4abb905e8252760e39db.JPG"><br><br>  Under the lid is the device itself.  It lies tightly in the box, and from the sides of the tablet is framed by a foam insert. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95c/729/093/95c7290930d64db9b6c11b59acfa30a7.JPG"><br><br>  Under the tablet is a shelf of thin cardboard, and under it are parts of the package.  It was possible to make separate sections for picking, then the contents of the box would look more neat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/963/171/c09/963171c091804f7aa596a86c49eead91.JPG"><br><br>  With the tablet, we will sell headphones, a charger, a USB cable, an OTG cable, a stylus, a cleaning cloth, a case, a warranty card, and a user manual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09f/644/36c/09f64436c8424125b122283e367fbb36.JPG"><br><br>  The charger is adapted to our sockets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5e/78e/c2d/c5e78ec2d0c04957afe6977e770672dc.JPG"><br><br>  With the help of an OTG cable, not only flash drives can be connected to the device, but also a keyboard.  This is quite convenient, especially if you are working in office programs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/786/527/8e9/7865278e972a47a181a338bf618f325c.JPG"><br><br>  Headphones included vacuum, quite standard.  The sound is clear, without wheezing, but a bit quiet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d32/a16/c2e/d32a16c2e38f43c1ae593a8e448ae32d.JPG"><br><br>  The complete stylus resembles a cap from a pen, and is approximately identical in size.  Despite the small size it is convenient to use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/314/3fb/c79/3143fbc795854452a4fc00237e4b9e24.JPG"><br><br>  In order not to lose the stylus there is a special mount, made in the form of a headphone plug. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/326/224/a7c/326224a7c28949dc9b3ef2ead528b30c.JPG"><br><br>  The cover-book is made of an incomprehensible synthetic material.  On the front side there is a drawing in the form of a longitudinal polishing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/700/5dd/004/7005dd004eaf43b380000cba0bcaf25d.JPG"><br><br>  Inside texture resembles suede.  The tablet itself is attached to the case on a sticky strip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f4/752/c92/2f4752c92d04410f8afbb367abb86c8a.JPG"><br><br>  The device in the case sits well, although the impression remains that the tablet is about to fall out.  Yes, and protects the case from damage is bad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b30/962/4cb/b309624cb8f9436088764bc56269cc7b.JPG"><br><br>  In general, the manufacturer decided to save not only on the mount, but also on the material.  The cover smells awful.  I'm not even talking about the weak tablet protection and inconvenience.  Smell - the main reason why the cover is simply impossible to use. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ffd800">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DESIGN, DIMENSIONS, CONTROL ELEMENTS</font> </h2><br>  bb-Mobile Techno 9.7 3G is made in a classic design, which was borrowed from the iPad Air.  Special design delights are not here.  On the tablet "out of the box" pasted a protective film.  By the way, the main features of the tablet in a colorful form are written on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5db/b5b/9d8/5dbb5b9d8d02495ca6935628559abcec.JPG"><br><br>  The main part of the front face is occupied by a 9.7 inch display protected by glass.  It is not the most durable, but it will precisely protect against small scratches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f0/38b/5c7/7f038b5c769d47c0b5d37c0e0e0a2f22.JPG"><br><br>  Above the display is the front camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b84/c2a/68a/b84c2a68a17d4af39293990ceba2f1de.JPG"><br><br>  The control buttons are not separately selected, so that only after unlocking they will be available. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/817/570/c42/817570c42e3a467db23a9f50bebc0f9e.JPG"><br><br>  On the right is the on / off / lock button and the volume button.  Below there is a hole for a hardware reset, there is undoubtedly a benefit from it.  It is easier to restart a frozen tablet with its help than with a key combination.  All buttons are convex, easy to grope with your fingers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/602/a43/eec/602a43eec2484773b9b5de3014431ecf.JPG"><br><br>  In the top corner there is a 3.5 mm headphone jack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c8/3a2/386/3c83a23868ed498b8984386b9d03bf84.JPG"><br><br>  And below - the holes of the speakers and microUSB.  The sound is clear, but at the maximum volume begins to "fade" a little. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/71c/5db/537/71c5db5374f34eee8ca1d37b1056329a.JPG"><br><br>  The back panel is metallic, light-colored, the surface is smooth, the tablet slides a little in the hands.  It is relatively easy to scratch, so I recommend using a complete case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/092/140/c47/092140c4759e4fddb40a7bc5d643b4ce.JPG"><br><br>  Above - "camera window", manufacturer's logo.  In the cold season, it will not be very comfortable to hold the tablet, but such a decision along with beauty allows better heat removal when the CPU is loaded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/794/99c/753/79499c7537434c9b86e7961a56f4d937.JPG"><br><br>  As well as a plastic cap under which the slots for the SIM-card and microSD are hidden.  The body is completely ‚Äúiron‚Äù to make it difficult, because somewhere you need to place the antenna for the communication module, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/851/caa/6c8/851caa6c81fe4509a0bb11188906d200.JPG"><br><br>  The device turned out thin, only 7.9 mm.  The weight of the device is 586g, which is not very easy.  In general, the design only pleased.  The manufacturer used quite expensive materials.  Everything is done soundly, efficiently, no backlash, no creaks.  But it is worth remembering that this is essentially a clone of a more expensive device. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00a8ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DISPLAY</font> </h2><br>  bb-Mobile Techno 9.7 3G is equipped with a 9.7 inch TFT IPS display with a resolution of 1024x768 pixels.  The number of pixels per inch is 132 ppi.  For such money, you should not count on the notorious "retina".  And even if it were, the processor with such a resolution would probably not cope, which would lead to the brakes.  But it‚Äôs not comfortable to see Retina on such a screen either. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1aa/15a/8c8/1aa15a8c847a4f6bbf9bafaa9dcf4c2a.JPG"><br><br>  The brightness of the screen matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãslightly above average.  Under the conditions of a room, the image looks good, in the light or in the sun it fades strongly, the information becomes almost unreadable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac3/0b8/0ca/ac30b80caacf465ab539c5bae28a4599.JPG"><br><br>  The capacitive type sensor layer works up to 5 simultaneous touches.  The sensitivity is not bad, but due to the rapid contamination of the display surface, the sensitivity is often sharply reduced.  It is necessary to wipe every time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09a/89b/d8a/09a89bd8ac60420da4ca36bf85da1501.png"><br><br>  There is no automatic adjustment of the brightness of the display under the lighting. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CAMERAS</font> </h2><br>  The tablet has two cameras: front, resolution 0.3 Mp and main, resolution 5 Mp.  The quality of shooting leaves much to be desired.  The colors and contrast are good, but the definition is terrible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65d/b0e/995/65db0e995a1946638797e2f2cbf3e89c.jpg"><br><br>  Photos from the front camera is just awful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e2/14c/492/9e214c492ea741f389d9915c72cb2948.jpg"><br><br>  So the camera here is just for show. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00ffff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">SOFTWARE PLATFORM</font> </h2><br>  Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean is installed on bb-Mobile Techno 9.7 3G.  It will be a bit old, one could have something fresher. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd3/892/5bb/cd38925bb26846e29c92ff08ba500202.png"><br><br>  There are several features of the shell on this tablet.  The first is pre-installed applications.  Among them are Navitel Navigator, File Manager and Yandex Market.  A nice feature is that the background menu is the same as on the desktop.  Well, another, relatively useful feature is the screenshot button, transferred to the control panel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76c/266/d4a/76c266d4a6514c129672518a6e3123b2.png"><br><br>  Firmware is stable, but there are small brakes skipping.  The only disadvantage is the clogging of memory useless applications, but it is tolerable. <br><br><h2>  <font color="9000ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">PRODUCTIVITY</font> </h2><br>  The tablet has a MediaTek MT8382 quad-core processor with a frequency of 1.3 GHz and a Mali-400 MP2 video processor with a frequency of 533 MHz.  This processor is a budget and provides the ability to work with two SIM cards and video processing in 1080p format, that is, Full HD.  Because of the savings, the device turned out not very productive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/787/7d5/e0d/7877d5e0d60f4a8cb7fa6b21df2a717a.png"><br><br>  Test results in popular benchmarks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/262/e1a/d38/262e1ad38deb4ff0885de30adf622dfb.png"><br><br>  Graphics performance is also not very. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/090/6a0/a88/0906a0a88f394421bcd0a9621ae34569.png"><br><br>  Such results are explainable.  Since the device is positioned as a budget, so the manufacturer has saved on everything.  In games, the device behaves appropriately.  Slowdowns and FPS drops happen regularly, but you can play games like Asphalt 8, albeit not very comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc5/ee9/bc0/dc5ee9bc00034902b5e7bb3a41c2b95f.png"><br><br>  Injustice braked hard enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/77f/ce9/7fd/77fce97fd98c4cbfaee31fc8b20cbc3d.png"><br><br>  In general, the performance is satisfactory.  For surfing the Internet and easy games is enough. <br><br><h2>  <font color="EA5F39">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">WIRELESS NETWORKS</font> </h2><br>  The device supports work with Wi-Fi and 3G.  It is also possible to make calls.  It occurred to whom it would be convenient, not clear to call from an A4 sheet.  But the same bb-Mobile release Bluetooth headsets in the form of small telephones, perhaps this was the calculation.  The dialer is standard, from Android, it is possible to send SMS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/023/455/5e4/0234555e4b8c4d42bf2a28057d8c49e7.png"><br><br>  The Wi-Fi module finds many networks.  The signal is stable and quite powerful, although some routers are far away. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f4/faf/2a6/5f4faf2a6fe74f3c86aec1d28c699994.png"><br><br>  The walls are not a hindrance for him either. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb7/9eb/b84/bb79ebb841bf47f4a03aca0a369e53c4.png"><br><br>  The tablet supports GPS navigation.  The module finds 6-10 satellites, although the device does not work with GLONASS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1cd/566/ad2/1cd566ad223f49e6b5eaa0f933ab09e9.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="1C1C1C">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">BATTERY, CHARGING, TIME OF WORK</font> </h2><br>  The bb-Mobile Techno 9.7 3G is equipped with a 6000 mAh battery.  Despite the fact that the battery has a large volume, it does not last long, because the display is quite large.  For a whole day of the tablet is enough.  True, there is no power saving mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4dd/21b/14b/4dd21b14bc754479ad5f9eb10277cf51.png"><br><br>  When watching a video tablet is discharged in about 6 hours. <br><br><h2>  <font color="6BB501">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CONCLUSION</font> </h2><br>  Overall, bb-Mobile Techno 9.7 3G creates a positive impression.  The design of the tablet almost completely repeats the design of iPad Air.  Bad or good copy designs - a moot point.  Someone likes the appearance of the reference tablet, but someone wants to try something new.  In the production of high quality materials used.
