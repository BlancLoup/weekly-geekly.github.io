They do not bear the ever-increasing burden of laying a new generation of networks, but at the same time they actively, and most importantly, effectively use them for profit. <br><br>  But even in the face of these unenviable tendencies, the mobile giants of developed countries are not moving too much - revenues are still high and they have time to determine the direction of development. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Operators </h4><br>  However, in some developing regions where ARPU is much lower, operators have long been looking for additional ways to increase revenue from each subscriber.  One of them is building your own cloud services.  So did our client Moldcell, the second largest mobile operator in the Republic of Moldova: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/3ad/30c/913/3ad30c913bf4d8a205f6ded7a2304b60.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://www.comunic.md/">Moldcell Comunic</a> is a service built with Pronto!  - <a href="http://communigate.com/communigatepro/russian/XIMSS.html">XIMSS</a> client <a href="http://communigate.com/ru/">Communigate Pro</a> for browser, mobile and desktop computers.  Comunic allows users to save files, contacts, receive mail and connect with friends and acquaintances through one application.

      Of our customers, operators, Tele2 (Sweden) occupies a special place.  Already in 2007, they launched a service to provide mail and IP telephony based on the <a href="http://www.communigate.com/CommuniGatePro/russian/Clusters.html">Communigate Pro cluster solution</a> , which currently has 2.5 million mail users and more than 300,000 voice accounts: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/7ce/6b1/73a/7ce6b173a8bc0e201bfecc9a6238dfad.jpg"><br>  The picture simply demonstrates the architecture, the real cluster works on 5 backends and 16 frontends, some of which are dedicated exclusively to telephony. <br><br><h4>  VHS providers </h4><br>  Not only operators have a need to increase revenue from each user.  This year, Communigate Systems paid special attention to the niche of solutions for hosting providers. <br><br>  Hosting providers typically use a large set of applications covering various communication technologies.  Unfortunately, most of these products bring little value to them, and often create more work than income. <br><br>  The company CommuniGate Systems has released a set of applications ‚ÄúWeb Energy Stack‚Äù for the 3rd generation cPanel Adapter.  It was designed to improve and expand the existing ‚ÄúVPS cPanel Stack‚Äù usually deployed with hosting providers.  New features relate primarily to video, VoIP, chat and web client ‚ÄúPronto!  Lite ‚Äù(HTML5 client using WebRTC). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/d75/ffb/5cd/d75ffb5cd49508e240776569d792d96a.png"><br>  CommuniGate Pro and cPanel are installed and run entirely on a virtual server, with no additional external or additional hardware.  This means hosting providers can provide high-quality service to a larger number of clients without additional infrastructure investments.  In addition to less work on supporting and configuring services (everything works on a single monolithic core, rather than on several loosely coupled programs), CommuniGate Pro also offers a dramatic improvement in scaling density by supporting 15 times more users on a virtual server in comparison with older applications. <br><br>  Web client HTML 5 Pronto!  very simple for both user and admin.  At the same time, it provides the client with something new and interesting.  The same premium services can be added to the old mail web client, simplifying the transfer of clients to a premium account. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/d00/6c2/58b/d006c258b2a2640d4c25dbac8e2b8b42.png"><br>  Pronto!  HTML5 using WebRTC for video and voice (rate the interface yourself on the demo booth <a href="http://bestvoip.ru/">bestvoip.ru</a> ) <br><br>  cPanel is fully built on open technologies, managed, maintained and developed by the global community of VPS hosting providers.  The project is posted on the <a href="https://github.com/communigate/communigate-cpanel-adaptor">GitHub Code</a> website and all VPS providers are invited to make changes and improve the technology to fit their needs and customer requests. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">About CommuniGate Systems</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  CommuniGate Systems develops the most efficient and secure unified communications technology in the world, providing businesses of all sizes with excellent communication and collaboration capabilities.
