It is often claimed that the world production of traditional fuel cars will grow for several more decades.  However, recently the Bloomberg NEF published a report stating that the production of traditional cars (for simplicity, we will call them oil cars) has already reached its peak and will not grow in the future due to increased sales of electric vehicles.  The peak of oil consumption by motor vehicles, which inevitably follows the peak of sales of oil vehicles, makes this issue especially acute.  In more detail with dates of these events we will try to understand the article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Interpretation of abbreviations from graphs</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  ICE - Internal Combustion Engines (Internal Combustion Engine); <br>  PHEV - Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (Hybrids with the ability to connect to the mains); <br>  BEV - Battery electric vehicles (Electric); <br></div></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ql/xt/ri/qlxtrivypzwzrjbiogvg1qtggyy.png"><br><br>  Sales of electric cars in this decade grew very rapidly, and it became obvious that such growth someday would cause a drop in sales of oil vehicles.  But when exactly humanity will begin to refuse cars with ICE no one knew.  Oilmen hoped that sales of oil vehicles will grow for several decades.  The more unexpected was the statement by Bloomberg NEF, published in a <a href="https//about.bnef.com/electric-vehicle-outlook/">review of the market for electric vehicles in 2019</a> that sales of oil vehicles began to fall after more than 100 years of growth.

      Bloomberg NEF does not specify in which year the peak of sales occurred.  But according to the consulting company LMC Automotive, in 2018, 94 million new passenger and light commercial (LCV) cars were sold worldwide, which is 0.5% less than 2017.  In 2019, the fall continued on the world's largest automobile market, the Chinese.  Therefore, it seems that 2017 will be a record year. <br><br>  Now the most important thing: after the peak of sales of oil vehicles, the peak of the world car fleet and the peak of oil consumption by this fleet should follow.  Based on the average service life of a car for about 12 years, it can be assumed that the global fleet of oil vehicles will be maximum 6 years after 2017.  That is, the peak of oil consumption by motor vehicles can occur in 2023 (the same date <a href="https://finance.rambler.ru/markets/40778343-spory-o-zakate-ery-nefti-nakalyayutsya/%3Fupdated">is called the</a> analysts of the London Research Center Carbon Tracker Initiative and the Norwegian risk management company DNV GL) <br>  Let's see what year predicts bloomberg NEF. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r_/hg/e2/r_hge2sd90sljlzb0bs5pkcjoyq.jpeg"><br><br>  Bloomberg NEF predicts that the peak in demand for oil from passenger transport will come in 2028, and from commercial transport in 2035.  This forecast is very conservative since the difference in the peak of the sales of oil vehicles and the peak of oil consumption is not 6, but 13 years. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">From a mathematical point of view, the difference between the peak of sales of oil vehicles and the peak of oil consumption should be 6 years, which is why:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  If the service life of the car was several months, then the peak of the fleet (and the peak of oil consumption) would coincide with the peak of sales of oil vehicles, that is, it would have happened in 2017.  But cars are durable goods with an average service life of about 12 years.  Therefore, the peak of the fleet should occur 6 years later.  If the average service life were 40 years, then the peak of the fleet would have come 20 years after the peak of sales.  In reality, it may happen that the peak of the fleet will happen 5 or 7 years after the peak of sales, but this is less likely.  The maximum mathematical probability is in 6 years (half of the service life).  The peak of oil consumption usually coincides with the peak of the fleet in all studies, the increase in energy efficiency is usually neglected.  If we take into account the increase in energy efficiency, the peak of oil consumption will come earlier than the peak of the fleet of oil vehicles, that is, before 2023. <br></div></div><br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br><ol><li>  The peak of oil consumption by motor vehicles will come within 12-15 years after the peak of sales of oil vehicles. </li><li>  Perhaps humanity can not predict in advance the peak of oil consumption, as it could not predict the peak of sales of oil vehicles due to extremely conservative forecasts. </li></ol><br>  PS Independent studies show that the peak in oil consumption by motor transport will come in 2023.  The same date is confirmed by mathematical calculations.  Oil companies and Bloomberg NEF claim that the peak of oil consumption by motor vehicles will happen no earlier than 2030.  Let everyone make for themselves the conclusions about the independence and objectivity of Bloomberg NEF forecasts. <br>  PPS The Central Bank of the Russian Federation <a href="https://tass.ru/ekonomika/4965342">believes</a> that the peak of demand for oil from motor transport will be in the mid-2020s, which coincides with the opinion of organizations independent of oil industry. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">UPD: Bloomberg has a forecast with a peak in oil demand in 2023, which they themselves consider unlikely</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In 2016, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-ev-oil-crisis/">published a</a> forecast for the development of the electric vehicle market with an annual growth of their sales of about 60%.  They considered this forecast unlikely, and therefore not essential.  The problem is that in 2016, 2017 and 2018, sales of electric cars grew according to this ‚Äúunlikely scenario‚Äù (46%, 61% and 64%).  And in 2019 it is expected that this scenario, which is unlikely for Blomberg experts.  And in 2020-21, the same rapid and equally unlikely growth is expected for these experts. <br>  The fact that a couple of years seemed unreal today has become inevitable. <br>  It is important to understand that peak oil consumption will not occur in all countries at the same time.  For example, in Norway, electric cars have already caused a decrease in oil consumption.  Next in turn are such countries as Denmark, Sweden, Iceland and China, leading in the introduction of electric vehicles.  The reduction in oil consumption in these countries will probably come as a complete surprise to experts, since these experts greatly underestimated the impact of electric transport. <br><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455407/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455407/</a></p>
