Known: the Pascal triangle, the Pythagorean square, the Pyramid of Cheops.  I wanted a cube.  Rubik created, why I do not? <br>  Technology since Rubik's time went a little forward, so something technological is needed, in the spirit of the times, using domestic components and a little more meaningful than Malevich‚Äôs square. <br><br>  Rubik used multicolored - leave. <br>  The peak of recent times: processors - we use both PIC and many processors. <br>  In Rubik, in order to get the result, you need to break your head a little - an interesting direction. <br>  There are algorithms for assembling the Rubik's cube - let's open the algorithm for the operation of the Radik cube. <br>  Many schemes have been created for assembling the Rubik's cube - let's draw the Radik's cube scheme. <br>  Rubik's cube is an old thing - add antiquities and strike with nostalgia for modernity. <br>  At all corners they shout about GLONASS - we touch. <br>  For readers of programs, and especially for novice writers, we attach a program of work for the cube with detailed comments. <br><br>  As a result of the joint work of the goloruk (abbreviated from the head and hands) the Radik cube was born. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a8/295/10b/8a829510b4ca7ebe5bd120c2a7bd3b41.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Almost 15 million seconds passed since the creation of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/135806/">‚ÄúLamp of Time‚Äù</a> , I decided to implement a desktop version of the radiator with a modern receiver.  The new project simplified the hardware, significantly reworked the software.  The only thing remaining is the principle of time display.

      As you know, information is in the air.  Part of it enters the Earth from outer space.  The cube catches this stream, as a sculptor, cuts off all unnecessary and shows us only the right.  It is difficult for an uninitiated person to understand what the cube is blinking about, for this you need to break your head a little. <br><br>  <b>Mystery: the operation algorithm is</b> revealed simply. <br>  <b>1.</b> Rejoicing at the emergence of power, the lower face of the cube flashes with all three available colors.  This is made for lovers of the modern direction of automotive design.  They believe that the LED lights of the bottom are cool. <br>  <b>2.</b> After the color greeting, the cube starts to flash in blue, anticipating a long-awaited meeting with space information.  Thanks to the hot start, it does not last long - faster than you spend on finding the extra word in each of the three sentences: <br>  - The razubaby sparrow, the weak-temperate badger and the velvety beaver floundered in the two-bell-shaped air intake of the Khabarovsk bakery. <br>  - A mechanic from Johannesburg, an employee from Bahrain and an accountant from Harbin went astray by a murmur in Bukhara. <br>  - The fast-extinguishing Habaner of the brave Verkhnebavarsky vibrotechnique excited the gas turbine on Brahmaputra. <br>  <b>3.</b> The most valuable thing in the cube is the time display: the number of red flashes is the clock, green is the minute, blue is the background that is lit until the beginning of a new minute. <br>  <b>4.</b> It is always interesting to know how many satellites the receiver sees.  Especially ours!  To do this, there is a special button, and if you press it, the red flashes will show the number of GPS satellites, and the green GLONASS. <br>  <b>5.</b> Not all people live in the same time zone, although there is a trend towards this in our country.  To adjust the difference from Greenwich, you need to press the button before powering up and hold its required number of flashes.  The memory of the cube is good, it will remember this setting. <br><br>  Now joking aside, let's do a <b>description of the design</b> . <br>  So that neither side of the cube was offended, each facet has an individual processor. <br>  As in the human brain, which has enormous computing power and potential, only a small part of it actually works in the cube. <br>  At the heart of the design is the ancient stone Intel Pentium MMX 200. His twin brothers also form the front, back and top sides of the cube.  Everything has changed in our world, and now the processors themselves play the role of a voluminous motherboard for the installation of modern components. <br>  The left side is covered with its ceramic case by guarding the Intel Pentium 100 computer history, and the right side is its more advanced descendant of Intel Pentium MMX 166. <br>  Surprisingly, none of the findings were harmed during installation.  The receiver and antenna successfully fit into the free output spacing.  Apparently, the developers of these devices are going to continue to integrate with powerful external processors. <br>  In total, the motherboard processors have 1,184 gold-plated outputs, of which 296 support the entire design. <br><br>  Small photons that carry time information by highlighting the underlying surface are easily punched through the pins of the lower processor.  The light is scattered and does not attract attention.  To determine the time, it is necessary to take a look at the cube and briefly hold it, training the skills of oral counting. <br><br>  If you disassemble the cube, it turns out that inside it is empty, everything you need to work is located on the edges. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ae/a41/a75/5aea41a756b7df930d77e3f8757ddfba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The face of the whole composition is the pride of Russia, the latest domestic development, modern assistant Susanin, GLONASS / GPS receiver <a href="http://naviaglonass.ru/gl8088s">GL8088s</a> .  Her heart: a system on a STA8088F crystal.  If you still imagine that this system is on a crystal on a different crystal: the Pentium MMX 200, and even surrounded by many other crystals, then the head can spin around this crystallization.  To prevent dizziness, the shape of the structure was chosen not round, but more stable - cubic. <br><br>  At the top of the cube (as close as possible to the place where the spacecraft ...) is an active antenna 2J431G-500RG174-C20N with a gain of 26dB at a supply voltage of 3V.  It is possible that the processor is missing only in this part. <br>  With a small surgical operation, with a slight movement of the hand, the antenna was upgraded to 2J431G-14RG174-C20N, where the modified digit shows the cable length in centimeters. <br><br>  A small and modest <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/41203E.pdf">PIC16F688</a> processor is attached to the back of the design.  What is he doing is incomprehensible, but if you pull him out of the panel, then everything stops working.  In general, the necessary element. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/983/a1b/83f/983a1b83f650ac888f1128a6c601ff56.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is not enough for the cube of its processors, so it is still connected via USB to the system unit of the computer.  According to reliable sources, this is all only dust in the eyes - ostensibly, equipment with a modern interface.  Through the port he receives only energy feed.  Therefore, instead of the system unit, you can use a small mains charger with a USB connector. <br><br>  And yet, where is his button?  - asked Urry in <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">‚ÄúThe Adventure of Electronics‚Äù</a> .  The button is hidden inside the cube and the connection with this button is not simple, but magnetic.  For it to work, the cube must hit the arrow of Cupid with a magnetic neodymium tip. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f9b/c9a/7a0/f9bc9a7a0175466b870afb083af3febb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unlike navigation tasks, the receiver does not need much, in order to get the information it needs, a single satellite is enough, and it doesn‚Äôt matter what country it belongs to. <br>  He clings to his companions very quickly.  If ‚ÄúLampe‚Äù needed a few minutes to give something away, then the new lad in less than a minute always shows an excellent result.  He does not need a battery.  Appeared power - got the exact time! <br>  Due to the high sensitivity and the presence of an active antenna, the cube communicates with the Cosmos from anywhere in the room. <br>  The Supostan satellites hold the receiver firmly in their arms, keeping them in sight for a long time.  GLONASS was pleased with its existence, but was upset that the satellites were playing hide and seek.  By the number of satellites present in the message, they are still losing.  It will be necessary to observe which satellite numbers appear in the message and find out how much they are actually used in the system. <br>  If in the historical match ‚ÄúArgentina - Jamaica‚Äù the score was 5: 0, then when testing the system, the result of 7: 0 was once observed not in our favor.  But as a rule, the usual excess is one and a half, two times. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd8/1f5/653/fd81f56535e882bec04e5f6cb3fbcf8a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The transformer is wound with barbed wire (still no one reads the technical description carefully). <br><br>  And now let's drop the fairy tales and move on to the <b>theory</b> . <br>  Navigation satellites transmit a large amount of information. <br>  The receiver used in the cube works with <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS">GPS</a> and <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%259B%25D0%259E%25D0%259D%25D0%2590%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A1">GLONASS</a> .  In the future, there will be support for <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE_(%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">GALILEO</a> . <br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2591%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">A GPS receiver</a> receives information from satellites, processes and sends the result using a specific protocol to a serial port or radio channel. <br>  Most receivers output the result using the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA">NMEA 0183</a> text protocol. <br>  Each line of this text message carries a variety of information. <br>  Our task requires information about the time and numbers (and therefore the number) of visible satellites. <br>  This data is contained in the lines: <br>  <b>GPRMC</b> is the recommended minimum for navigation data. <br>  <b>GPGSA</b> - active satellites. <br><br>  In order not to overload the controller with the flow of information, we will save it from unnecessary data.  To do this, using a 3.3V power supply and interface converter (I used the old phone's connection module to RS-232), connect it to the computer. <br>  From the <a href="http://naviaglonass.ru/">manufacturer‚Äôs</a> website we download and launch the <a href="http://naviaglonass.ru/otladochnaya-plata-navia-gl8088s">‚ÄúNavia Viewer‚Äù</a> program. <br>  After pressing the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button, we make the necessary settings: <br>  - ‚ÄúMessages‚Äù tab.  The list of transmitted NMEA messages - checkboxes for RMC and GSA - set; <br>  - tab ‚ÄúSatellites‚Äù.  Satellite constellations - checkboxes on GPS and GLONASS - set; <br>  - ‚ÄúRestart‚Äù tab - hot; <br>  - ‚ÄúData Output‚Äù tab.  Exchange rate for NMEA port - 19200 - set. <br>  All this can be asked to make a supplier when purchasing a receiver, but I did not succeed, so I had to make a computer connection and figure out on my own, which I do not regret. <br>  To control the incoming information, instead of the standard program from the developer, you can also use the built-in Windows program ‚ÄúHyperterminal‚Äù. <br><br>  As a result of these manipulations, every second information arrives from the pin 15 of the receiver: <br>  $ GPRMC, 070943.000, A, 5551.352, N, 04834.256, E, 0.1.0.0.020612.0.0, W * 7F <br>  $ GNGSA, A, 3,02,13,04,10,05,29 ,,,, 2.8,2.2,1.7 * 2B <br>  $ GNGSA, A, 3.88.92 ,,,,,,,,,, 2.8.2.2,1.7 * 2B <br>  In the first line we are interested in the numbers 0709: hours (GMT) and minutes. <br>  The second line: 02,13,04,10,05,29 - GPS satellite numbers, 6 pieces. <br>  Third line: 88.92 - GLONASS satellite numbers, 2 pieces. <br><br>  The PIC16F688 controller processes the stream of incoming information and issues time in the form of multi-colored blinks, as well as the number of satellites, if the button is pressed. <br>  Everything is very simple. <br><br>  <b>Directions of modernization.</b> <br>  1. Modify the USB interface to full to use the time to synchronize the computer. <br>  2. To equip the cube with a low-power transmitter for broadcasting time in the nearest district to a simple clock with a receiver or via a computer network for setting the time. <br>  3. Work on various ways of displaying information proposed in the comments to the ‚ÄúTime Lam‚Äù. <br>  4. Add a white seven-segment indicator to show time to those in a hurry or too lazy to count.  One of the options: stick a film with SMD-LEDs on the front of the receiver. <br>  5. Make a flat version of the clock: a vintage processor, and in the center, between the pins, an indicator showing the time. <br>  6. Set the automatic brightness control to work at night. <br>  7. Display the location on a small LCD screen. <br><br>  In principle, it is possible to exclude the ‚ÄúUTP Setup‚Äù input in the controller, by means of which the time offset of this region relative to Greenwich is set. <br>  The navigator gives the location coordinates, tables with the required offset for each location can be flashed into the controller. <br>  But frequent changes in the laws regarding the transition to winter and summer time suggest that it is better to leave the manual setting. <br><br>  As they say - dreaming is not bad!  One interesting, slightly fantastic, but quite realizable direction. <br>  Many gardeners use the lunar calendar.  There are also <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%258B">lunar hours</a> .  But they only show the exact time on the full moon night. <br>  If you place an analogue of the cube on the moon, then the exact time from the satellite of the Earth will always come in, although it will be visible only at night. <br>  Walking on a starry night, people will count time not by the stars, but by the moon. <br>  Experts can easily calculate the power, type and size of the emitter, as well as the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe solar battery to implement this idea.  To simplify the design, it is possible to use only one color and apply the encryption method used in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/135806/">‚ÄúTime Lamps‚Äù</a> layout.  To reduce energy costs it is possible to use a controlled reflector of the sun's rays, which has a small area. <br>  It is much easier to place the radiator on one of the artificial satellites of the Earth or on the ISS, which will significantly reduce the power of the radiator. <br>  Then it will be possible to observe the flight of the ISS not only by determining the trajectory of motion and coordinates on the Internet, but also with my own eyes. <br>  If the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA-1">first satellite was</a> broadcasting in the invisible radio air ‚ÄúBip!
