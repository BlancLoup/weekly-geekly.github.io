      Sean helped many Internet companies and startups to achieve incredible growth. <br>  When he decided to retire, naturally, it was necessary to find a replacement for him. <br>  Traditional marketers came to posted vacancies who did market analysis, made plans <br>  development, improved positioning, but it was not that ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  "Standard" marketers have a wide level of capabilities, but startups <br>  At the beginning of your journey you need only one thing - <b>GROWTH and a full stop.</b> <br><br>  Sean asked the marketer and got it, so an idea came to mind. <br>  He decided to change the name and on July 26, 2010 the following heading appeared on his blog: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/677/37f/1ab/67737f1ab71d47b9ada226a11aee8e75.jpg"><br><br>  Growth Hacker is not a substitute for the marketer.  Growth Hacker is no better or cooler marketer. <br>  These are slightly different directions: <br>  The first - are obsessed with growth and nothing more. <br>  The second - perform a wider range of tasks. <br><br>  It is best to quote Sean to answer the question ‚ÄúWho is a Growth hacker?‚Äù: <br><blockquote>  "A growth hacker is a person of true north is growth" </blockquote><br>  Translation: <i>‚ÄúGrowth hacker is a person whose sole purpose is growth‚Äù</i> <br><br>  It is impossible to study growth hacking, because technologies on the Internet are developing so fast that the information that worked today may be irrelevant tomorrow.  In addition, if you can massively train grocery hacking techniques, then this will no longer be a creative way of growth, but the most template one.  You can get explosive growth where no one is looking for it. <br><br>  Therefore, there will be no theory.  Only examples and tips from practice. <br>  I have compiled 14 Growth Hacking strategies for the B2B market.  It is for b2b, since I myself work in this segment and, in my opinion, getting clients in B2C is easier. <br><br>  So, we begin: <br><br><h1>  B2B Content Marketing on "steroids" </h1><br><h2>  1. Create entertainment content for your target audience, without direct advertising. </h2><br>  All tired of direct advertising.  Our internal filter simply blocks it and does not notice. <br>  Create something new for your target audience.  Attract attention. <br>  A sense of humor is a great way to evoke emotions, and therefore remain in the memory. <br><br>  For example, we recently did a <a href="http://www.perezvoni.com/pravdamatka/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3DCPM%26utm_campaign%3Dmegamozg_14_b2b_growth">test for success PravdaMatka</a> , after passing which, each participant receives personal advice on business. <br>  The test is based on the advice of Oleg Tinkov, he acts as the main character, we put him in the center of the screen and in a comic form showed what the main secret of success is. <br><br>  During the first 3 days, we received more than 300 reposts and thousands of clicks to our site.  Let's see what will happen next. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/940/440/7d7/9404407d770946c197a82838568951e1.jpg"><br><br>  Another example from the west.  Checkmarx attracted 65,000 security experts on the Internet through the <a href="http://gameofhacks.com/">‚ÄúHacker Game‚Äù</a> . <br>  This is a developer quiz consisting of security questions.  You can test your knowledge in programming and add your own questions to other participants.  What is the result?  7,500 visitors and 200 responses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25e/442/f25/25e442f25cdd4fc1be3635749e0293bb.png"><br><br><h2>  2. Content based on SEO or inbound-marketing. </h2><br>  <b>Inbound marketing</b> is <b>content-based marketing</b> that <b>drives a</b> website. <br>  in search results and makes you experts in the eyes of readers. <br><br>  This is a funky tool! <br>  Regular SEO website promotion has long since moved away from it. <br>  I like the way Artemy Lebedev speaks in the <a href="https://youtu.be/PkG2Y8GT8WU%3Ft%3D1h54m38s">video</a> about seo-optimizers, where he is absolutely right. <br>  Instead of ‚Äúpuffing up‚Äù over months to optimize the site, spend a decent budget on the reference mass and write clumsy text on the site for robots, it is better to move to a zone of less competition and do seo promotion of individual articles. <br><br>  <b>How it works?</b> <br>  You select the necessary "keywords", check their popularity in <a href="http://wordstat.yandex.ru/">wordstat.yandex.ru</a> and write an article to your blog for these requests. <br>  For example, at one time I was promoting the project #pupslove - this is a network for pregnant women. <br>  To promote, we opened a <a href="http://pupslove.me/">blog</a> and wrote dozens of articles for the most popular Central Asian requests: ‚ÄúHow to conceive a boy?‚Äù, ‚ÄúMassage for newborns‚Äù, etc ... <br>  Articles are indexed and now bring free traffic to the site, and most importantly, make us experts in the eyes of readers. <br><br><h2>  4. Translate posts into presentations and upload to SlideShare. </h2><br>  <a href="http://slideshare.net/">SlideShare</a> is something like youtube, but for presentations only. <br>  This is a good way to ‚Äúreuse‚Äù content and get a new audience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89c/8b6/049/89c8b604995244fb9e3b552c0a973c48.png"><br><br>  The presentation should contain only theses of your post. <br>  After uploading content to slideshare, make sure that you specify the title, description and "keywords" correctly. <br>  This is important, because the number of new readers depends on this. <br>  Also, downloading a presentation, you offer readers more diverse and easily perceived content. <br><br><h2>  5. Make a list of useful tools. </h2><br>  Good, useful material worth its weight in gold.  In any subject, especially among online businesses, you can collect a list of useful tools that simplify life.  Think about what will be interesting for your audience and make a post on the topic: ‚Äú15 indispensable gadgets for a traveler‚Äù, ‚Äú10 tools that will help simplify the work of an accountant‚Äù, ‚Äú12 time management applications‚Äù ... <br><br>  For example, we have compiled a list of tools that we used ourselves: <br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/perezvoni/blog/11258/">"37 tools to increase conversion and sales growth"</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/130/6aa/1c9/1306aa1c9aee40c3a57a4cd517163c64.jpg"><br><br>  The article scored more than 16,000 views. <br>  The audience likes such articles, but only if you have compiled a really valuable list, and have not done it for your own advertising. <br><br><h2>  6. Compare your product with competitors </h2><br>  One of the most productive types of content is comparison with competitors. <br>  Such posts appear in the top lines of the search engine and help potential customers to determine at the stage of selection. <br>  I admit, we did not write any similar article, we were lucky - others did it for us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e90/be8/9e2/e90be89e29334f2ca096ac58ea328fd5.png"><br><br>  For example, on request: "Callback Widget" or "Callbackhunter Analogs" in the top issue there were several <a href="http://tvoerazvitie.com/bla-bla/item/483">articles</a> in which we were mentioned.  This brings us additional traffic to the site. <br><br><h2>  8. Video content.  Open YouTube Channel </h2><br>  The video format works much better than the article, for two reasons: <br>  First, because of human laziness.  Easier to watch the video than read the article. <br>  Secondly, you will get an additional audience from youtube. <br>  And finally, thirdly, you will be better remembered, since the video works on two channels of perception: visual and classroom. <br><br>  I made some useful videos, one of which became popular: ‚ÄúWhere can I find clients?  13 ways to attract customers. "  Result: more than 15,000 views. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/h6evd0QuxyE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjNTYRtO0SPbQ0vOIAvBs60r046VA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  9. Create detailed guides or instructions. </h2><br>  Perhaps this is the most fruitful form of content marketing.  Moz took a top position on the query "SEO" in a search engine using the guide <a href="http://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo">"SEO for beginners</a> . <a href="http://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo">"</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0dc/b3e/d84/0dcb3ed84a9743dabb4ae7247b3b218c.png"><br><br>  By the way, you can process your own content into a new format.  After the video from point 8, hundreds of people began to write me <a href="http://vk.com/yagodkinvs">VKontakte</a> with questions: ‚ÄúHow is this done, and what is this? ...‚Äù.  Therefore, a separate site <a href="http://startupskills.ru/">Startupskills.ru</a> has recently been released, which contains 13 ways to attract customers with free guidance. <br><br>  The project is absolutely free and made to help startups. <br>  I indicated a link to the site in the video and in the first week I received more than 200 reposts and traffic to the site. <br><br>  An important point, if you want to receive additional traffic from the repost, then be sure to list in the site code, meta tags and upload a picture for the social.  networks. <br>  I first made a mistake and forgot to do it.  The reposts looked like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10b/1ab/469/10b1ab46905b4994a9e8a86fb4dec7b7.png"><br><br>  With meta tags and a picture, it already looked like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f1/29d/7b8/6f129d7b87f243459be3609e120bd1ae.png"><br><br><h2>  10. Retargeting the audience for a particular post. </h2><br>  This is not about standard retargeting, which leads to the site, but about personalized retargeting. <br>  There are chances that many visitors to your blog will leave the page without even knowing what your product is capable of.  One of the main ways to lure them back is to use <b>Retargeting</b> . <br>  This can be done using Vkontakte, Google, Yandex, Facebook and other services.  Having an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich blog post a person has entered, you can place an advertisement that is likely to be interesting to him.  Imagine that someone is interested in any technology.  Place an ad on which will show how this technology works with your invention. <br><br>  This technique is used by the online store <a href="http://enter.ru/">Enter</a> , but not only in a pair with content, but with a shopping cart.  If you add a product to the cart on the site and do not buy it, then later on Vkontakte you will be haunted by advertising of this particular product (at least it used to be).  It works cool! <br><br><h1>  <u>New Product.</u>  <u>New customers</u> </h1><br><br><h2>  11. Create a separate product. </h2><br>  Neil Patel known in the Growth hackers circles, co-founder of KISSmetrics, Crazy Egg, made a separate and useful service called <a href="http://quicksprout.com/">QuickSprout</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f05/50a/3a3/f0550a3a3d784928bf8198667d749313.png"><br><br>  The bottom line is that the service analyzes your website for errors for free and gives optimization tips.  At the end, a pop-up window appears that says that you can correct errors on the site yourself or order a service from a professional. <br>  Thus, the part of users was converted into clients. <br><br><h2>  12. Joint promotion. </h2><br>  A good way to get customers for free and quickly is to work with companies that work with a similar audience like you, but are not your competitors.  Here are a few ideas: <br><br><ul><li>  Exchange blog posts </li><li>  Exchange banners in posts </li><li>  Collaborative Webinars </li><li>  Joint newsletter </li></ul><br><br><h2>  13. Find out where other companies come from. </h2><br>  Competitors can teach you a lot. <br>  Find out where they get traffic from (blogs, websites, social networks, etc.), what kind of advertising and banners are suitable for their product. <br>  Do not blindly copy, it will be noticeable, besides it‚Äôs not a fact that you will get a similar result.  Analyze, invent, act. <br><br>  To find out free information about your competitor, please visit <a href="http://similarweb.com/">Similarweb</a> .  Deeper analysis can be obtained through other services for a fee. <br><br><h2>  14. Hand out cool souvenirs. </h2><br>  A lot of time is needed for your company to become ‚Äútrendy‚Äù and become popular, so that people will be on the same wavelength with you.  Users always crave T-shirts, bags and other things, even if your brand is not the coolest. <br>  Create souvenirs and distribute them to your customers for free. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24f/c3f/2d1/24fc3f2d191e421187e43837b25356bf.jpg"><br><br>  These 14 strategies will help to win customers in the b2b segment.  Try all the tools, do not dwell on standard methods, sooner or later you will find the right combination to crack your own growth.  Explosive you sales! <br>  Write in the comments if you have something to add from your own experience. <br>  I will be glad to questions! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc3/db0/fce/dc3db0fce01c4d4f918810dd36052ff1.jpg" align="right"><br><br>  Author: Vitaly Yagodkin, CEO Perezvoni.com <br><br>  I keep my own startup blog. <br>  I share my experience and knowledge with everyone they might be interested in. <br>  Obsessed with growth.
