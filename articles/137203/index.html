This is a simple truth, but not everyone pays attention to it.  Who pays, he becomes the most successful! <br><br>  <i>It is impossible to build a successful business without establishing effective feedback from customers.</i> 
      <br>

      <br>
      The more successful the business, the brighter it is noticeable that the company strives to hear its customers and tries to competently implement their ideas, requests, complaints and suggestions in their activities. <br><br>  We also understood very well that <i>‚ÄúWrite us an e-mail‚Äù</i> is not a feedback at all, but only an inevitable minimum, so we began to search the market for any ready-made solutions on this topic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  In search of beauty ... </h4><br>  Unfortunately (or rather fortunately) we did not find anything good.  All that was - copied each other and did not develop at all where we would like.  For example, we did not like that ideas and proposals from customers lie in the clear form - in full view of all competitors.  They can safely take all these ideas, copying you or even advancing in development.  And all the problems and complaints from customers, while also in the clear, expose your weaknesses.  This is also bad. <br><br>  We also did not like that all these systems are too one-sided, they are difficult to adapt to their business.  And it is of little use if the reviews are piled into one heap and cannot show something common, objective. <br><br>  <i>As a result, we decided to invent our own feedback system - a grand, special, devoid of all these problems and shortcomings.</i>  <i>Come up with something that the market has never seen before.</i> <br><br>  Read more about the process ‚ÄúFrom idea to release‚Äù read on. <br><br><h4>  Identify problems </h4><br>  To begin with, we formulated the most important tasks: <br><ul><li>  Getting feedback separately on different aspects of the company, and not all in a bunch. </li><li>  Free embedding feedback form.  So that it can be noticeable, but not intrusive.  Could fit into the surrounding landscape. </li><li>  A simple way to express an opinion, without wasting your time on authorization, filling in a variety of fields, links and drop-down menus. </li><li>  Private storage of ideas and wishes of customers, away from the eyes of competitors. </li><li>  Simple and clear formation of analytical information, filtering ideas and feedback in order to present the overall picture, trends. </li></ul><br><h4>  From problems to the best idea to solve them! </h4><br>  We figured out how to solve all the problems described above.  Our solution was the slider, which is fully customizable for any needs of the company (Question, color, size, etc.).  It can be embedded in any part of the site and find out from customers about their attitude to any issue (from 0 to 100%) and the company's section.  If the assessment is not 100%, then the slider asks the client what companies should undertake in order to become better and be ‚Äúone hundred percent!‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e7/53f/f7b/1e753ff7b820dbf81d50e4f50b7845a8.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  From restrictions to infinity! </h4><br>  Thus, we have developed a tool that can be adapted for any task - to find out both the general attitude towards the company, and individual moments: for example, the level of service, those.  support, variety and functionality of tariff plans, payment methods, any internal sections of the site, blog, or even every single article, product or service! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac8/288/c51/ac8288c5163e3dfd9e285d1b5eb61ab5.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec1/584/d32/ec1584d3273fdb01992f5c16be876517.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Home "chip" ideas! </h4><br>  The uniqueness of our solution lies in the fact that the rating is assigned a rating from 0 to 100%.  This in itself opens up incredible prospects for analysis! <br><br>  But that's not all.  We taught the slider to memorize the assessment of a particular user and at least a week later allow him to change his opinion.  This gives the company the opportunity to track the correctness and effectiveness of all its most recent actions, in other words - to keep abreast of the business! <br><br><h4>  From "all reviews in a bunch" to convenient filters </h4><br>  The received reviews are conveniently stored in the control panel, sorted by the level of marks and categories: <br><ul><li>  First opinion </li><li>  Increase score </li><li>  Downgrade </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a2/fb3/1d7/7a2fb31d7cea8c0d401ba3bd9ba7142a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Analyzing the lower ratings, you can see where you are wrong and what is wrong with you.  Thanks to the filtering by the level of the assessment, it becomes clear that the customers do not like the most and eliminate it first.  And if you examine the reviews to improve, you can find that your users like most and focus on it, securing success. <br><br>  Now the problem of setting priorities and tasks is solved by itself! <br><br><h4>  Uppza charts - a clear path to success </h4><br>  The reviews themselves are only part of our idea.  As we have developed, we have an idea to present visually how the attitude of customers to different aspects of the company is changing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/941/0c9/41c/9410c941c784a1417a2112c142fec024.png" alt="image"><br><br>  So based on customer ratings, we have developed three graphics: <br><br>  <i>1. General attitude</i> <br>  Based on all estimates combined and displays the average value.  By observing how this attitude changes over time, you can understand whether you are approaching success or not.  If the value grows - you are on the right track.  And if it does not grow, then you can immediately examine the reviews and see why. <br><br>  <i>2. The pulse of business</i> <br>  Perhaps this is a damn important schedule.  It will save you a lot of time, money and effort during development.  The schedule is built only by the most recent customer estimates, not including the first. <br><br>  Thus, if you have made a mistake somewhere in the development, decisions, ideas, etc., then thanks to this schedule, you will quickly understand it and promptly eliminate the cause. <br>  If this schedule has crawled upwards, then it will be logical to ‚Äúpush on the gas‚Äù - to focus even more on what customers like. <br><br>  <i>3. Non-indifference of customers</i> <br>  This is an interesting and peculiar graph, which is based on how many people who saw the slider left their opinion.  After all, if a person left an opinion, then your activity is not indifferent to him.  And the more such ‚Äúindifferent‚Äù ones, the better.  After all, for the most part, it is your loyal and loyal customers.  Trying to strengthen the love and devotion to your brand, you will be able to navigate according to the schedule, how successful your attempts. <br><br>  <i>By the way, we are developing several more types of graphs, which will improve the accuracy of the analysis and simplify the work with feedback from your customers.</i> <br><br><h4>  High ideals ... </h4><br>  When creating this tool, we put in the first place not our own vested interests, but the desire to help companies become better and more successful.  Here our logic was based on the fact that the more companies introduce Uppza, the more comfortable and better we ourselves will exist in this world.  After all, we, and you, and all other people use the services of a huge number of very different companies. <br><br>  Thus, we did not make high price tags and created very affordable rates, comparable only with the bill in a cafe for morning coffee! <br><br>  And now the most pleasant part.  Having also a special sympathy for habr-residents, we decided to give you a special bonus habr code!  Everyone can use it, not just one person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7b/5be/2d3/e7b5be2d3c67bf06214507a482be5477.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And in any case, the <a href="http://uppza.com/">service</a> itself <a href="http://uppza.com/">can be tried completely free for the first 15 days</a> .  We will be happy if Uppza helps your business.  We are waiting for your feedback on how you used our tool in your work.  After all, it will help us improve and develop it according to your desires! <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137203/</a></p>
