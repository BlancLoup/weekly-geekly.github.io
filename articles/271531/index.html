      The grid will be adjusted this week: the halls are of different sizes, and you will need to understand which reports inside the timeslot are more popular in order to put the most popular report in the first, largest, hall, and not very popular reports - in the fourth hall. <br><br>  A month ago, I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/269595/"><b>announced the</b></a> first 7 of them, and now it‚Äôs time to go for a short run through the rest. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/050/a55/ffe/050a55ffea72a4e36831d966011c3011.png" alt="goldshtein" align="left" width="126"><br>  <b>Sasha Goldshtein</b> from sunny Israel, Microsoft MVP, will add a bit of hardcore to our everyday life by making two reports at once. <br><br>  <b>The Vector in Your CPU: Exploiting SIMD for Superscalar Performance</b> - a report on how vector CPU instructions are used in modern .NET.  It will be about how the System.Numerics.Vectors library and the new RyuJIT will allow you to overclock your application using SIMD instructions.  <a href="http://msk2015.dotnext.ru/talks/goldshtein2/">Read more ...</a> <br><br>  <b>Automating Problem Analysis and Triage</b> - a report on how to do automatic analysis of dumps using ClrMD, a .NET library that helps examine threads, call stacks and exceptions;  visualize threads and locks, including detecting deadlocks, and walk along your heap to help you examine the structure of objects in your application.  <a href="http://msk2015.dotnext.ru/talks/goldshtein/">Read more ...</a> <br><br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/212/2f7/e7b/2122f7e7b6313e867b1245d4c89658d1.png" alt="soshnikov" align="left" width="126"><br>  <b>Dmitry Soshnikov</b> from Microsoft will make a report on <b>functional F # programming in big data processing and machine learning</b> . <br><br>  In the report we will consider one of the aspects of using the functional language F #: data processing.  Starting from simple examples, we will move on to solving the classical machine learning problem of recognizing handwritten numbers, then consider using F # to implement computing on cloud clusters using the MBrace platform. <br><br>  The report will be of interest both to developers who have not had experience with F #, and to more experienced functional programmers who want to use the power of F # for distributed cloud computing.  <a href="http://msk2015.dotnext.ru/talks/soshnikov/">Read more ...</a> <br><br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aed/d56/32e/aedd5632e44cb5e6739c42afa552b935.png" alt="kochetkov" align="left" width="126"><br>  <b>Vladimir Kochetkov</b> , Timlid of the PT Application Inspector code security analyzer development project and one of the founders of the RSDN, will tell you about the <b>pitfalls of System.Security.Cryptography</b> . <br><br>  In this report, without unnecessary mathematical hardcore, we will talk about typical scenarios for using cryptography tools in .NET applications, consider the best practices for solving common problems, analyze typical vulnerabilities and see demos of several real attacks on the most interesting ones.  <a href="http://msk2015.dotnext.ru/talks/kochetkov/">Read more ...</a> <br><br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/778/c28/bb2/778c28bb2556c564a2612882fbe4edd4.png" alt="kulakov" align="left" width="126"><br>  <b>Anatoly Kulakov</b> from Paladyne Systems will talk about <b>structured logging</b> . <br><br>  The report talks about how to turn logs scattered throughout the disc into a full-fledged Event Source system.  And to give each developer a feel as an almighty analyst. <br><br>  All this is possible thanks to structural logging (Structured logging), which introduces a semantic component to your logs.  The main problems of the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) will be considered.  We will look at how to work with structural logs in .NET using the Serilog library.  We will solve several practical problems with the help of available tools, which without the semantics of the journal would not be lifting.  We will understand with a specialized server Seq.  And, of course, we will find ways to quickly and painlessly migrate existing applications to this miracle stack.  <a href="http://msk2015.dotnext.ru/talks/kulakov/">Read more ...</a> <br><br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/710/c8e/80f/710c8e80f7be5f5b2091c71b2cf87207.png" alt="shvedov" align="left" width="126"><br>  <b>Alexander Shvedov</b> from JetBrains will talk about the <b>design and evolution of the C # language on the example of properties</b> . <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis report originated from the everyday task of the IDE developer - C # 6.0 language support, included in Visual Studio 2015. The language enhancements related to the common language tool, property declarations, were suddenly difficult to maintain and highly affect the existing automatic refactoring code that was deeply needed understand most of the features of C # properties.  In this report, Alexander will invite students to reflect on this ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù language tool, to trace in detail the development of properties from version 1.0 of the C # language, to reflect on the design problems of C # and look at the properties through the eyes of the IDE developer. <br><br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a2/3b0/c10/5a23b0c1062b53f24088716ad4b9463b.png" alt="yakovlev" align="left" width="126"><br>  <b>Igor Yakovlev</b> from Positive Technologies will talk about the <b>use and the DLR device</b> . <br><br>  The report will look at both the internal structure of the DLR (from the dynamic keyword in C # and the generation of code that implements dynamic operations) and the practical value of this subsystem (the frameworks that use it).  This material will allow you to understand how classes such as DynamicObject and ExpandoObject are implemented and how they can be used in your code. <br><br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c4/03b/21e/3c403b21e9924e8b75b884ecf107dd68.png" alt="nikitin" align="left" width="126"><br>  <b>Alexander Nikitin</b> from Adform will give a report on <b>.NET Generics under the hood and a JITter bug for dessert</b> . <br><br>  In the report, we‚Äôll recall the .NET Memory Layout, start WinDbg, see how .NET generics are built from the inside, what CLR optimizations are taking to be fast, and most interestingly, often as fast as the usual methods. <br>  There will be a dessert - a bug in Jitter!  Only hardcore!  Even more hardcore - in discussions. <br><br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e0b/6a1/615/e0b6a16158b4dc819652049af82a8402.png" alt="ozerov" align="left" width="126"><br>  <b>Vladimir Ozerov</b> from GridGain will talk about the <b>interaction with the native code</b> . <br><br>  In the report, we will look at key techniques for interacting with native code, discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and also get acquainted with the internal implementation of a number of tools in the CLR.  As an example, we will consider solutions applied when migrating Apache Ignite (distributed cache written in Java and C ++) to the .NET platform. <br><br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6a/bf6/c67/e6abf6c6766d0e1baa470b5e3c8bb8dc.png" alt="karpov" align="left" width="126"><br>  <b>Andrey Karpov,</b> aka <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/andrey2008/" class="user_link">Andrey2008</a> , CTO of the company CCVerOver and code analyzer <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/pvs-studio/">PVS-Studio</a> , Microsoft MVP, will give a report on <b>static code analysis</b> . <br><br>  Andrei will talk about what the methodology of static code analysis is about the correct and incorrect use of analysis tools.  Further, it will show examples of errors that can be identified using tools such as ReSharper, PVS-Studio, Visual Studio SCA.
