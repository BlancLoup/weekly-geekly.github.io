The conference, organized by the company Positive Technologies, will bring together leading cyber defense experts and the elite of the hacking world, representatives of government agencies and leaders of big business, young scientists and journalists. <br><br>  In 2014, more than 2,500 specialists from 18 countries attended the PHDays IV conference.  The PHDays formula remains unchanged: the excitement of the discoverers, the lack of dull advertising, unique equipment, a huge testing ground for experiments, a professional conversation essentially, informal communication between hackers and security guards, real incidents at the heart of the competition plots. <a name="habracut"></a>

The World Wide Web has accelerated the exchange of information, and the pace of scientific and technological progress resembles a rocket taking off.  Neural networks and quantum computers, the ‚ÄúInternet of things‚Äù and artificial intelligence, nanotechnologies and bioengineering ... What happens if all this starts working for the benefit of people all at once?  Perhaps this will be the most wonderful time in the history of mankind ... <br><br>  Or vice versa - the most dangerous epoch for society, when a wave of chaos covers digital space and distorts unprepared reality.  In this new world, your every word and action will be saved, indexed and used against you.  The boundaries of this world for some people will be transparent, and for others - will become the walls of a new prison. <br><br>  So, we are approaching the bifurcation point, and even a minor impact on a complex system can cause an avalanche-like restructuring.  Which option is waiting for us?  High-tech barbarism from the Gibson's "Trilogy of the Bridge" and the kingdom of Pelevin tsukbrins - or the new "Midday, XXII Century", where human civilization moves to the next level, defeating disease and mastering other planets? <br><br>  Every evening, closing our eyes, we risk waking up in a different universe.  A universum flying to infinity at any moment can turn its run and rush to the starting point.  Or finish.  To the point of singularity.  Can we make the right choice? <br><br><h4>  The fifth spring will be hot </h4><br>  For four years, in addition to victories in <a href="http://www.phdays.ru/press/news/15233/%3Fsphrase_id%3D15741">ratings</a> and various <a href="http://www.ptsecurity.ru/about/news/22279/">awards, the</a> forum has earned a lot of kind words from the professionals of the information security community. <br><br>  <i>A word to the experts:</i> <br><br>  <b>Bruce Schneier,</b> cryptographer, head of information security at British Telecom: <br><br><blockquote>  We have been holding security conferences for more than a decade.  These are mostly boring corporate events.  But this conference is something completely different.  She inspires, she is practical and very counter-cultural. </blockquote><br>  <b>Mark Hauser:</b> <br><br><blockquote>  I was waiting a lot when I was going to Moscow.  I thought here were the harsh Russian hackers, all with such long beards, dressed in black, sitting hunched over their little laptops.  In fact, it turned out that everything is very benevolent and open ... At the conference, you could easily meet business people in strict suits and students in T-shirts - a great cocktail turned out! </blockquote><br>  <b>Nick Galbret:</b> <br><br><blockquote>  Defcon has a competitor.  And this is good. </blockquote><br>  <b>Sergey Khodakov,</b> Head of the IB-direction of the Skolkovo Foundation: <br><br><blockquote>  PHDays provides an incentive for talented teams to think about developing innovative products in order to find themselves in business, in the ‚Äúwhite‚Äù information security community. </blockquote><br>  <b>William Haygestad,</b> American expert on military cyber technology: <br><br><blockquote>  PHDays is a unique event that provides an opportunity to see how security is created, and who is who in this area.  The forum stands out against the general background thanks to realistic contests such as CTF, the Critical Infrastructure Attack competition on hacking SCADA systems and overcoming an obstacle course in a smart home. </blockquote><br>  <b>Geohot:</b> <br><br><blockquote>  It was awesome and very intense. </blockquote><br>  <b>Marc Furre,</b> President of the Swiss company ComCom: <br><br><blockquote>  Great experience.  PHDays is an exceptionally creative event.  Amazing atmosphere. </blockquote><br>  <b>Yuri Grin,</b> Deputy Director of the ITU Telecommunication Development Bureau: <br><br><blockquote>  Events like PHDays provide a better understanding of the many issues of information security and the complexity of the challenges faced by specialists from various industries in the course of protecting the ICT infrastructure. </blockquote><br>  <b>Vladimir Zhirinovsky:</b> <br><br><blockquote>  Together we must find ways to ensure that young people do not become criminals.  Need to work on the positive! </blockquote><br>  Preparation for PHDays V is already in full swing: experts from the organizers draw dozens of drawings, conduct nightly tests behind closed doors, buy unusual equipment. <br><br>  See the <a href="http://youtu.be/qlUskfg4bVY">cutting</a> from the previous PHDays, the <a href="http://www.phdays.ru/press/news/38639/">records of the</a> best reports of the fourth forum and prepare your research for Call for Papers - the first stage of submitting applications for a speech will soon start.  Everyone has a chance! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qlUskfg4bVY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh7iWArA46RMjNHsGiCcwjOWXjqtg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  See you at the Positive Hack Days V conference! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244245/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244245/</a></p>
