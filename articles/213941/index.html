As we promised, at the MWC 2014 conference, which began on Monday in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthere was a presentation of Sony Mobile, where a lot of great new products were demonstrated!  The first is, of course, the new flagship smartphone Xperia Z2 with a new display (previously known as Sirius) and ultra-thin tablet Xperia Z2 Tablet.  In addition, the Xperia M2 middle class device and SmartBand bracelet, announced in January, were presented.  All the details, as usual, under habrakatom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e95/e51/aa2/e95e51aa25c0c9277cbb33db2f61584e.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Xperia z2</b> <br><br>  Sony continues the good tradition of updating the flagship model twice a year.  Replaced by the Xperia Z1 comes Z2 with minimal external differences - the frame around the screen has decreased, but very serious changes inside.  First of all, the display was upgraded - it was developed using Live Color LED technology, which implies the use of red and green phosphorus, blue LEDs and special filters, which makes the image even more saturated, in addition, the new screen has wide viewing angles and high definition .  The amount of RAM has grown to three gigabytes, the processor has changed to a more productive Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, the camera allows you to shoot video with a resolution of 4K (3840x2160), using "augmented reality" and a frequency of 120 frames per second, which allows you to achieve full slow motion.  Also worth noting is the digital noise reduction system, which allows to reduce ambient noise by 98% (subject to the use of special headphones).  Z2 sales will begin in March. <br><br>  <b>Screen</b> : 5.2-inch, 1920x1080 <br>  <b>Processor</b> : Snapdragon quad-core 2.3 GHz <br>  <b>Memory</b> : 3 GB RAM, 16 GB internal, SD card slot <br>  <b>Camera</b> : Exmor RS 1 / 2.3 ", 20.7 megapixel <br>  <b>Battery</b> : 3200 mAh <br>  <b>Protection</b> : IP58 <br><br>  <b>Xperia z2 tablet</b> <br><br>  Xperia Tablet Z is often called the best Android tablet on the market, but as they say, there is no limit to perfection.  Z2 Tablet can be safely the thinnest (6.4 mm) and light (426 g) tablet PC in the world with an incredible battery life - up to 10 hours of continuous video viewing or 100 hours of music playback without recharging!  If some people had claims to the Tablet Z screen due to insufficient viewing angles, then there is no such problem - the IPS-matrix will take care of this, but the color reproduction, like the smartphone Z2, is provided by the new Live Color LED technology.  Responsible for the performance of Snapdragon 801 and Adreno 330 with the support of 3 GB of RAM.  For convenient work with documents, you can connect an external keyboard (supplied separately), and a secure architecture and support for multiple accounts allows you to share Z2T with family members or colleagues.  The device will go on sale in March 2014, that is, very soon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c6d/df4/b39/c6ddf4b39f88da7c29e5346b0451370b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Screen</b> : 10.1-inch, 1920x1200 <br>  <b>Processor</b> : Snapdragon quad-core 2.3 GHz <br>  <b>Memory</b> : 3 GB RAM, 16 GB internal, SD card slot <br>  <b>Camera</b> : Exmor RS 8 megapixel <br>  <b>Battery</b> : 6000 mAh <br>  <b>Protection</b> : IP58 <br><br>  <b>Xperia m2</b> <br><br>  This model, as you can guess, replaces the low-cost, compact and dvuhsimochnoy Xperia M, but the difference in performance is very impressive.  The fact that yesterday was available only to the owners of the flagships can now be received by anyone.  M2 will appeal to those who are not ready to overpay, but do not agree to use a low-power outdated smartphone.  The Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 quad-core processor and the Adreno 305 video accelerator provide high performance, and the LTE module provides high-speed communications.  The 4.8-inch screen with a resolution of 960x540 is, at the moment, the largest screen in this class, and the 8-megapixel Exmor RS camera has acquired additional features migrated from its flagship devices - HDR, Timeburst Shift and Picture Effect.  In addition, you can now add various third-party applications to the camera interface, such as Vine or FX Guru.  Well, there are still two slots for SIM-cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1da/d54/e6a/1dad54e6add2398ef385ff04e61a7d61.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Screen</b> : 4.8-inch, 960x540 <br>  <b>Processor</b> : Snapdragon 400 quad-core 1.2 GHz <br>  <b>Memory</b> : 1 GB RAM, 8 GB internal, SD card slot <br>  <b>Camera</b> : Exmor RS 8 megapixel <br>  <b>Battery</b> : 2300 mAh <br>  <b>Protection</b> : no <br><br>  <b>Smartband</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/358/dbc/f6e/358dbcf6e09ac5f802f145396b47e4b5.jpg"><br><br>  We already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/209420/">told</a> about this ‚Äúsmart bracelet‚Äù in January.  Despite the resemblance, it is significantly different from the usual fitness trackers and allows you to keep a record of not only sporting achievements, but also a lot of everyday activities (and even the absence of any actions).  The data is diligently recorded in a special Lifelog application for further analysis, which, if used properly, can be very useful in terms of time management.  All this, in turn, does not negate the possibility of using SmartBand for training.  Bracelet sales will begin in March of this year. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213941/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213941/</a></p>
