  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How are the meetings at google</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Vice President Marissa Mayer holds an average of 70 meetings per week.  This is not surprising, because it plays the role of the main intermediary between the numerous development teams of <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> and the management of the company.  Sergey Brin and Larry Page meet Marissa every day. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In companies such as Google, it is during meetings that many important issues are resolved, the development process is monitored and the motivation of employees is carried out.  Meetings are very important, and their effectiveness is a critical factor.  Marissa Mayer names <a href="http://yahoo.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/sep2006/sb20060927_259688.htm">six rules</a> that must be followed for a successful "rally". <br><br>  1. <b>A clear plan</b> .  A meeting schedule must be agreed some time before it starts.  The schedule is a kind of agreement between the meeting participants about what they are going to discuss and how to do it in the shortest possible time.  The plan, while allowing for changes, should be clear. <br><br>  2. <b>Record theses</b> .  During Google meetings, multiple screens are used to increase efficiency.  Next to the main projector there is an additional one that displays the current abstracts of the meeting.  There is a third screen - this is a ticking clock, a timer that counts down the time until the end of the meeting.  The current meeting abstracts should be written by a special person, and Google guidelines insist on the shorthand accuracy of these abstracts.  These ‚Äúofficial documents‚Äù can then be sent to those who missed the meeting, and also presented to management.

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      3. <b>Micro-meetings</b> .  In the framework of long meetings, you can organize a number of short-term sessions of 5-10 minutes on specific topics.  Such a ‚Äúmodular‚Äù structure of the meeting makes it easy to change the plan of the event, if the need arises.  The fact is that in the calendar of Marissa Mayer, the minimum time periods are 30 minutes.  In such a schedule is difficult to drive.  The only way out is 10-minute blocks. <br><br>  4. <b>Individual reception</b> .  Every day after 4 pm, Marissa Mayer receives visitors from her staff for 90 minutes.  These are small one-on-one meetings where current issues can be resolved without prior scheduling.  Employees come to the vice-president to agree on the design of the program or, for example, to share their own interesting developments.  It was at the reception that Marissa first showed and approved such projects as <a href="http://news.google.com/">Google News</a> , <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">Orkut</a> and <a href="http://desktop.google.com/">Google Desktop</a> .  For half an hour, Marissa Mayer has time to hold up to fifteen meetings. <br><br>  5. <b>No policy, only data</b> .  This thesis implies that any decision must be clearly reasoned, and in no case be made under the influence of personal likes or dislikes.  Marissa Mayer does not approve the use of ‚ÄúI like‚Äù phrases in design meetings.  Instead of expressing personal preferences, you need to conduct appropriate research and find out which design is more effective. <br><br>  6. <b>Giant timer</b> .  Large clocks on the wall should create some kind of psychological pressure on the meeting participants.  The timer counts down the time left until the end of the meeting. <br><br>  By the way, many of these rules are used not only by Google.  For example, at a recent <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/yahoo/special-report--yahoo-open-hack-day-06-204584.php">Yahoo!</a> conference.  <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/yahoo/special-report--yahoo-open-hack-day-06-204584.php">Open Hack Day,</a> more than fifty hackers made small demonstrations of their developments, with each having 90 seconds of time, and the timer was counting time on the wall.  Such a system is really very effective. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4521/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4521/</a></p>
