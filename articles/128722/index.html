      At the entrance there were girls who registered participants on the sensor tables: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bad/35f/ba1/bad35fba17e002dcaf5b01eba85a9f24.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b9/330/468/5b93304682eeb0cf23d65007a3f60fb6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/80a/a6e/ca9/80aa6eca92ddbe6c73c436b013d55cc2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  600 people from various countries passed the selection, but only the strongest reached the finals - those who did not make mistakes in the qualifying rounds (each had 6 tasks).  50 best programmers, 50 geniuses from different countries - 26 from Russia, 11 from Ukraine, 7 from Belarus, two from the USA and one each from Georgia, Armenia and Switzerland. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/401/a42/162/401a421625b916b305f2085269e719b8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e2/9e6/2f8/5e29e62f841d9c11a46ee2ca61f22717.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1cd/26c/a35/1cd26ca35685bda203e9c4d1d7e87afe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  No, you heard?  26 people from Russia !!!  It is clear that not all bourgeois even knew about this event, but it‚Äôs much more pleasant to think that our mathematical school is still the most powerful! <br><br>  Moreover, what surprised me - 15 finalists are younger than 20 years old, 29 people have an age range of 21-25 years and only six are older than 26. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/022/799/13e/02279913e8c410e45be3c145be993893.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the hall itself, to be honest, the atmosphere was not from the category of ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù, but on the other hand, no one promised spectacles - everyone knew where they were going.  There was an almost perfect silence - the brain activity of the participants was expressively audible, which every now and then interrupted the clacking of the keys and instructions from the videographers' headphones.  The work was in full swing - someone thought through the solution of the problem on a piece of paper, someone at once with all ten fingers started writing the code, and someone just gnawed a sponsor's pen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a47/2a0/3f8/a472a03f801129fa93dd6241c613fc32.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af6/6f1/bdf/af66f1bdfc172c8b0b01f3ecc84aa550.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/39a/aad/29d/39aaad29d323cec9e71ce8e5c92382c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fda/3c1/707/fda3c1707b77526f562a5f242bdd0786.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/422/bfc/e35/422bfce358f05f9fefd9c120473f390d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5be/358/36b/5be35836b80b4ee179c8f115a17e85d7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f26/3b0/c3e/f263b0c3e22c030e9621667e27c234ae.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The photo shows that a brilliant solution of the problem has come to someone :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/575/c59/c3f/575c59c3f609bbf30c1884bc7fb788b4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Everyone could come with his laptop, the second monitor could not be delivered - in terms of conditions, everyone was on an equal footing.  Although someone's jobs were surprising.  Here, for example, a 4-pound gaming <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/95434/">ASUS G73 Stealth</a> :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc7/c6c/1b4/cc7c6c1b4c0ddb138fd7a8733d09e1ce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Sudden girl !!!  The only participant of the Olympiad! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ac/788/d4d/7ac788d4db61b2e2b5dd9aa5b39f6539.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  4 hours, 6 tasks and some tricky system for taking into account the time spent on each task, checking the correctness of its writing and counting the number of attempts to solve. <br><br>  When I read the assignments ... to be honest, I felt ashamed :) In some assignments I didn‚Äôt even understand what they wanted - not to mention searching for an answer and writing a solution in a programming language.  According to the organizers, the average graduate of a technical college is unlikely to be able to solve any of the tasks that the participant in the Russian Code Cup final has ‚Äúclicked‚Äù in 20-40 minutes.  However, you can see for yourself and, if you wish, try your hand. <br><br>  Nevertheless, there were people who managed to solve all the proposed tasks correctly in the allotted time - they became the winners, but about them a bit later. <br><br><h2>  Meanwhile... </h2><br>  While the programmers were working, a meeting was organized for journalists with the management of the Mail.ru Group company - <b>Dmitry Grishin</b> (general director) and <b>Vladimir Gabrielyan</b> (technical director) willingly answered all questions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/645/293/4e0/6452934e06ffe319f99101d0d2f626ba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to Mail.ru Group employees, there were also employees of ITMO St. Petersburg State University (St. Petersburg State University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics) - <b>Anatoly Shalyto</b> (Head of the Programming Technologies Department), <b>Parfenov Vladimir</b> (Dean of FITiP, Head of the IP Department) and <b>Andrey Stankevich</b> ( Associate Professor of the Computer Technologies Department) - those minds who invented tasks for the Olympiad and who concurrently train the younger generation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9a/c27/9b2/d9ac279b27f84b18328e8890ccf6a294.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I liked their attitude to the whole situation very much - it is clear that they have a clear understanding of the problem of education and a desire to solve it somehow.  It is clear that not all education as a whole (let any Fursenki do it) - I am talking about programming. <br><br>  It is not necessary to talk about the existing problem - everyone understands everything.  There is no money, the old ‚Äúmammoths‚Äù are already teaching something divorced from reality, and the new staff in the current state of affairs are not interested in teaching at all.  More precisely, they allocate enough money for education, but they are only spent incorrectly - they are distributed in a thin layer across all educational institutions. <br><br>  It is quite another thing when the issue of education is solved by joint efforts - universities and ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù.  In this case, Mail.ru Group has something to offer and now they are at the stage of determining the optimal incentive vectors for the younger generation. <br><br>  So in their opinion, there are about 2000 talented programmers throughout the country who cannot be taught the same way as everyone else - they need an individual approach.  And this is not so much about solid nominal ("point") scholarships, the main task is to popularize the profession of a programmer, to create the elite of programmer science.  In general, ‚Äúit is impossible to harvest, eating all the seed‚Äù - it seems that everyone already understood, but only the most interested really try to do something.  Now we need to go the other way - try to make sure that young and talented minds stay in Russia - if not on a permanent basis in universities, then at least in Russian companies.  After all, there are thousands of vacancies, but at the same time - a huge lack of good programmers.  Whether it turns out or not is a very interesting question. <br><br><h2>  results </h2><br>  Believe it or not, believe it or not, but the robots began the award ceremony.  After a short ‚Äúdance‚Äù the presenter appeared on the stage and announced three rather unusual nominations that no one expected. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sVekN2hIhoA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgGk0Nk4MVX6G4npwEAumYw9XsdsQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The first, ‚Äú <b>Literary Award</b> ‚Äù - went to the programmer who wrote the longest source code to solve any of the final tasks.
