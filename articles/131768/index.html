This time I decided to slightly change the format of the presentation, and instead of the usual report there will be a direct speech from the participants - everyone who was on October 27th, I asked to write a couple of words on the topic ‚ÄúWhy do you go to habravrestrechi‚Äù.  I've always been interested :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e4e66ce3/3e0b0cd6/a4142523/7aee345e.jpg"><br><br>  Nine revelations - under the cut.  And the next, already the eighth meeting - the day after tomorrow, in the same place and at the same hour.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  The idea was given to me by habrauzer <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/sergei_erjemin/" class="user_link">Sergei_Erjemin</a> , so the first performance was from him.  So, <br><br>  <b>journalist <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/sergei_erjemin/" class="user_link">Sergei_Erjemin</a> :</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c1774f7d/21fe623a/8de7d83f/83a1c1e7.jpg"><br><br>  - And I, as usual for me, was late.  By the way, just for 20 minutes.  As a result, I did not get a seat at the table.  We pulled a small round to a rectangular and I sat as if together and separately at the same time.  The table was divided into humanitarian and non-humanitarian part.  And I got to the first.  As a matter of fact, I have not been engaged in any technical Internet affairs for a long time.  I heard a lot about CDN, Cassandra and MangoDB, but I didn‚Äôt have to touch it with my hands (but periodically flood it, put it all in, adjust it and ... throw it as unnecessary) ... Actually no wonder.  Programming for desktops was abandoned in 1995, the creation of the Internet in 2004, and now freelance correspondent Kommersant and Expert (investment) and managing partner of the cluster business incubator <a href="http://wellstart.ru/">wellSTART</a> . <br><br>  Because  I was late all the time remaining telling what business incubators are, what they do, how they differ from business accelerators, venture capital companies, what happens to start-ups that fall on the screens of my locator, events around all this innovation-modernization bacchanalia, etc. At the end I really liked the collective solutions of problems on probability theory (I didn‚Äôt guess anything, but there was always something that pleases, along with the majority).  I forgot to ask my tricky task for ter.veru, but I was at a habro-final for the last time (hopefully).  Smash your head! <br><br>  <b>Electronic engineer Sergey <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dlinyj/" class="user_link">dlinyj</a> :</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2c93253c/aaac5795/aa79f44c/f7d0cc38.png"><br><br>  - I see any IT meetings as a good reason to meet interesting and smart people.  As a rule, this is a sort of club of interest.  You can always learn something new for yourself in it, learn something or teach others.  Often the necessary and interesting dating.  As a rule, the whole value of such meetings is recognized later, after years. <br><br>  At this meeting I met an interesting friend (habra-nick) Ocelot.  processor developer.  As it turned out, we work in adjacent fields.  My and its organizations are engaged in the development of processors, and as I understood supercomputers. <br><br>  With him, we have discussed splitting various tasks.  Plus, they thought how to parallelize on computing clusters-supercomputers the task of finding "happy" tickets, with numbers in the ticket more than 10. While the question remains open. <br><br>  It was also interesting to meet with a lawyer (in my opinion) Alexey.  Who asked an interesting "yes-netku" from criminology. <br><br>  Particularly amused various mathematical puzzles. <br><br>  I liked it very much, friendly atmosphere, a lot of beer and interesting conversations.  I can not say that the topics raised left me indifferent. <br><br>  <b>Lawyer Alexey <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/alexey_sirenko/" class="user_link">Alexey_Sirenko</a> :</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/9af99e6e/99354765/7fb41351/2b560b73.jpg"><br><br>  - For me, the humanities, communication with techies is always a reason to shake hands and look at familiar things from the other side.  In addition, being in a circle of smart and aspiring people in an informal setting is a gift to the soul in our vanity time. <br><br>  <b>The businessman and our frequenter <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/berq22/" class="user_link">berq22</a> :</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3a8e78ad/3687ebcd/85138559/6167c052.jpg"><br><br>  - Because there are people who are initially united by habry and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtechnology, so whoever comes, and whatever he does, everyone will be sincerely happy, and you feel at ease with hell of electronica, just as there are lots of useful contacts.  In any case, time is spent well, even if not enough drunk. <br><br>  <b>Sysadmin Aidar <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/fkvf/" class="user_link">fkvf</a> :</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b79ea495/0c9e50f5/c037363e/b2d6269e.jpg"><br><br>  - Every time new acquaintances, people. <br>  Here are those who do not burn their lives. <br>  In general, this is a great time-place-community for a friendly meeting, where you can drink rum, sit with good friends, find someone useful for you, do something useful for others. <br><br>  <b>Engineer Dmitry <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ocelot/" class="user_link">Ocelot</a> :</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/9f0077ba/3d966353/fba650eb/ae8b744e.jpg"><br><br>  - Habravstrechi for me is a kind of club where gentlemen (and ladies, but so far there are fewer) come to talk.  Separately, I am glad to have the opportunity to meet people from not entirely your field of activity, those with whom you usually have little intersection, but from whom you can certainly learn a lot of new things.  Last time, for example, it was interesting to listen to a lawyer.  In general, the impressions of the meetings are extremely positive, I will try to maintain the tradition, which I wish for everyone else. <br><br>  <b>Behind Ocelot in the frame - project manager Pavel <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/nasreddin/" class="user_link">nasreddin</a> :</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/47f25195/4798c6ef/ed1ee3f0/1ed97bb5.jpg"><br><br>  - Only in Habravstrecha you can live to see those people whose articles you read every day, with whom you communicate, whose topics are close to you and interesting. <br>  Foolishly living within walking distance of the interlocutor to communicate only on the Internet. <br>  It is interesting to learn about new projects from the organizers themselves, without slogans and advertising.  What did the process look like from the inside, what difficulties did the participants face ... <br>  And finally, this is just communication.  Not with neighbors who are engaged in things that are not clear to me and which in turn do not understand me, but with people who are close to my problems, who have similar interests and tastes. <br><br>  <b>Programmer Michael <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mktums/" class="user_link">mktums</a> :</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/975afd7d/0c825f57/7430fe5d/cf7f4557.jpg"><br><br>  - I go to habraecast because I habraalkash) <br><br>  <b>And sitting next to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/hodik/" class="user_link">hodik</a> :</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/579be060/e27a96d5/8544f9f4/822a0dd5.jpg"><br><br>  - Came the first time.  In most thematic meetings, all conversations are fixated around one area.  Habravstreche was able to talk on many new and interesting topics.  This is not my last meeting :) <br><br>  <i>The spelling and style of the originals saved.</i> <br><br><h4>  What's next? </h4><br>  The day after tomorrow, November 10th is already the eighth habra-situs. <br><br>  The topic of the meeting - we will come up with a name for our club. <br><br>  The meeting place <s>can not be changed</s> - the cafe "Mart", Petrovka 25s1, a hall with vaults.  Twitter announcements on the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/">#habraparty</a> . <br><br>  And tomorrow - an article on the results of the last meeting and the promised <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/conference/131770/">story about the Boston Mass Challenge</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0880b1bb/17f7e7c7/3bc9f0b8/d6581b05.jpg"><br><br>  Come :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131768/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131768/</a></p>
