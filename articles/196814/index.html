  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A short excursion to the opening of the robotics laboratory at the Lyceum in Moscow or the answer to habraposta</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The main reason for writing this note was the relatively large public interest in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/196490/">this post</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/195340/">its predecessor</a> .  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/goodsolder/" class="user_link">GoodSolder</a> talks about his impressions in the process (the very beginning) of the path, but I can try to share the experience of such an educational process after several years.  A few details under the cut <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In this article there will be more likely arguments that I had while reading the above posts. <br><br>  So, it all began in 2007, when, at the personal request of the administration, I came to work at the Lyceum in Moscow, at the Department of Computer Science.  Since there was experience in electronics and robotics, the issue of the special course did not stand and it was decided to start developing a small laboratory. <br><br><h4>  About people </h4><br>  Since we are not talking about compulsory classes, but about a circle, then we should mainly focus on those who are most interested.  Even if at some point they will be 1-2.  If he starts to achieve results - it will be the best advertisement for future generations.  At the same time, it is necessary to strictly follow the discipline: according to observations, it happens that the very interested person, with a friend who does not really need it, works much less efficiently.  Here it is worth intervening.

      Due to the specifics of a particular lyceum, in which education starts from the 7th grade, there was no communication with 6th graders.  But the huge difference is not only between 6 and 7, but also 7-8, 8-9, etc.  And if you look at a student who has been unaccustomed for a year ... There is nothing to compare here. <br><br><h4>  About documentation </h4><br>  The author mentioned the documentation, also in English.  Honestly, I can believe that there is 1 person who will climb it to read.  The rest is not interesting - not that age ... Unfortunately, apart from the Teacher, there will be almost no sources of information - you can put up with it.  In this regard, it is useful to look for opportunities to give students more time for independent work in the classroom, but when they have the opportunity to ask a question. <br><br><h4>  About knowledge </h4><br>  Count on the knowledge of a programming language and / or English chances are also zero.  We must learn to build from the bricks.  And so that it was possible to develop for the next years, considering that there will be new ‚Äúframes‚Äù :) And it‚Äôs unlikely that you will break up the circles by year of study - you have to be universal <br><br><h4>  On the subject of courses </h4><br>  To be honest, I have big doubts about the success of such a rapid transition to arduino.  We tried to go into programming right away ... Too big abyss: it‚Äôs truly noticed that they cannot connect a light bulb with a battery, and why the LED, which is also connected to the battery, flashes only once - this is fantastic. <br><br>  In the end, oddly enough, we went into robotics with ‚Äúblack magic boxes‚Äù, the meaning of which slowly becomes clearer: first, some modules are given ‚Äúfor faith‚Äù - it works, as they gain experience, students begin to understand their internal structure. <br><br><h4>  dead-lines </h4><br>  Yes, without them in any way.  But if they are invented, sucked from the finger, then they do not work.  But if it is natural, whether it is a competition or an exhibition, then it helps.  In addition to local events (all kinds of NTTM exhibitions), we tried every year to focus on Eurobot (autonomous or non-autonomous league) competitions.  Their main plus is a new task every year.  Thus, it is interesting to both old-timers and beginners, while there is every chance of winning.  Whereas competitions like sumo robots have existed for decades and there are some groundwork. <br><br><h4>  Instead of conclusion </h4><br>  For several years, managed to form a small community around the circle.  Yes, the strongest schoolchildren are those who started in 2007 (they were in the 7th grade) and were employed until the 11th grade.  Although I am no longer there, I still keep in touch with the resulting laboratory. <br><br>  At <a href="http://lyceum1586.ru/joomla/o-litsee/sotrudnichestvo-i-proekty/robototekhnicheskij-kruzhok">this link</a> you can look at some photos and some texts. <br><br>  If the topic is interesting - ask questions, I will answer short ones in the comments, the following notes may grow from long ones. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/196814/">https://habr.com/ru/post/196814/</a></p>
