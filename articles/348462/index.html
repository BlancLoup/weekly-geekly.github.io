  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Consilium in the smartphone: about the MegaFon.Health service and the development of telemedicine</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the end of last year, MegaFon began to develop its own telemedicine service - MegaFon.Health.  It is available from November for subscribers in Moscow and the region and was the first among the analogs in Russia to use the subscription model. <br><br>  The service is based on the Telemed Help platform.  About what MegaFon is. Health and how telemedicine lives in Russia in general - below, on behalf of the developers of the platform. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d0/c38/61f/8d0c3861f9602f3322ea4884c24d0dc0.png"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  A bit of history </h2><br>  Initially, we conceived Telemed Help as a useful iOS application for communicating with doctors.  But then they got a taste and it went: they added the ability to store and transfer medical data, they wrote versions for Android and Web.  And they also laid the possibility of using the platform under partner brands (white label) and fast scaling.

      At about the same time, mobile operators turned their attention to telemedicine, and at the most opportune way we had a ready MVP.  After the negotiations, we signed an agreement with MegaFon, armed ourselves with the operator‚Äôs brand book and, based on our platform, created the MegaFon. Health app for iOS and Android.  Now MegaFon is engaged in advertising and promotion of the service among its subscribers, and Telemed Help supports the work, data security and further development. <br><br><h2>  On the requirements of legislators </h2><br>  Working in accordance with current legislation helps us that our platform is located in the KROK cloud.  Integrator experts provide not only resources, but also the necessary means of protection, infrastructure and process audits, which save us from a hefty headache. <br><br>  Since January 1, amendments to federal law No. 242-, concerning telemedicine, came into force.  So we are waiting for technical work.  Since legislative procedures are not yet described, it is impossible to list precise modifications.  Most likely, the introduction of a digital signature of the doctor, patient identification and authentication systems, common classifiers of telemedicine services, integration with EGISZ and TFOMS will be required. <br><br>  In the West, all legislative delays related to telemedicine are already allowed, and for the time being we are at an earlier stage.  We implement the main points in accordance with 152- ‚ÄúOn the protection of personal data‚Äù.  In the summer of 2017, our platform was listed in the Roskomnadzor information dissemination register. <br><br><h2>  About benefits for doctors and patients </h2><br>  All services on our platform, we offer a subscription model.  MegaFon also uses it. Health - unlike, for example, Yandex. Health, where you have to pay for each consultation. <br><br>  The base cost of a monthly subscription to MegaFon. Health is 150 rubles.  An extended version is offered for 299 - here experts with more than 15 years of experience, as well as doctors of science are involved in consultations. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/260/add/718/260add718b31f20e1c38ae5d66e4e993.png"></div><br>  We have tried to make the service easy to use and therefore we hope that it will also suit older people with minimal experience with electronic gadgets and the Internet.  In addition, they often seek the advice of doctors, and payment on the basis of the subscription model will be beneficial. <br><br>  We highlight three key benefits of using telemedicine services.  First, they allow you to quickly get a "second opinion", in addition to the opinion of the attending physician.  Secondly, it is easier for doctors to track the treatment of patients.  Primary reception and diagnosis takes place, say, at full-time admission, but later, during treatment, it is more convenient to check in with the doctor remotely, and telemedicine services are excellent for this.  Finally, telemedicine provides more opportunities to choose a doctor - the patient is not limited in terms of geography. <br><br>  Our experience shows that telemedicine services are in demand among medical institutions.  In those clinics where there are already enough patients, they understand that telemedicine will help improve their work with them.  At the same time, the search for new clients does not require additional investments - unlike work through a medical aggregator, which takes money from the clinic for each patient involved.  In fact, the telemedicine service allows you to organize beneficial for all the interaction between the doctor and patient, the exchange of medical information. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/acf/b63/9a6/acfb639a6733cf501ced76079394ce90.png"></div><br><h2>  Plans for 2018 </h2><br>  In the near future, certain improvements are waiting for the service: it is necessary to bring everything into full compliance with the new legislation in the field of telemedicine.  On the other hand, we will continue to equip doctors and partner clinics with the Internet and the necessary equipment. <br><br>  The progress of the industry in Russia is slowed down due to the lack of regulations in the use of medical gadgets for remote monitoring.  We have our own manufacturers - but without state laws and certificates, state clinics cannot use this equipment, and such products almost completely go abroad. <br><br>  We hope that the situation with gadgets will improve, and we will actively help with this.  In general, we expect that the transition to the mass use of telemedicine services is a matter of a couple of years. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348462/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348462/</a></p>
