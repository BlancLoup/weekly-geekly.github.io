The slogan of the event is simple as a strike with a hammer about a snnu: We give [key] players of the [industry], you make deals. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  How it works </h5><br>  Participants negotiate upcoming meetings over the course of several weeks through the GC Meeting System.  And then for <s>three days</s> these meetings are held <s>together</s> at the event itself in separate rooms or at tables in the main hall.  GC is a great opportunity to meet most of your partners in one place.  The same, in fact, occurs at other conferences, but on the sidelines and unorganized.  Reports on the GC was not, and as far as I know, does not happen.

    <h5>  International contingent </h5><br>  Previously, GCs consisted mainly of console gamers.  This time everything is a little: developers / publishers of MMO, studios with products for PSN and XBL, developers for iPad, iPhone (though not many), developers of social network applications, monetizers, a couple of teams brought their 3D engines.  Attended Google Ireland.  Some companies visited the exhibition as a business-visitor.  <a href="http://bit.ly/fQ2q38">Full list of participants</a> <br><br><h5>  From the new and interesting </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.turbulenz.com/">Turbulenz</a> offered a system representing something in between <a href="http://online.com/">OnLive</a> , <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> and <a href="http://www.quakelive.com/">Quake Live</a> .  By installing a small browser plugin, users are able to play modern three-dimensional single-player and multiplayer games.  General catalog of games and monetization system is attached. <br><br>  There was also <a href="http://bit.ly/gmyKUc">one payment system</a> , offering users to link their account in any of the European banks to the IVR and make payments on a call by entering the password and the order number by dialing. <br><br>  On the day before the conference, everyone was taken on a tour of the Bandai Namco and <a href="http://maps.google.ru/maps%3Ff%3Dq%26source%3Ds_q%26hl%3Dru%26geocode%3D%26q%3Dbandai%2Bnamco%2Blyon%26sll%3D45.763032,4.83716%26sspn%3D0.051255,0.132093%26ie%3DUTF8%26hq%3Dbandai%2Bnamco%26hnear%3D%25D0%259B%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD,%2B%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0,%2B%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD-%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BF,%2B%25D0%25A4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%26ll%3D45.788539,4.813214%26spn%3D0,0.001032%26t%3Dh%26z%3D21%26layer%3Dc%26cbll%3D45.788539,4.813214%26panoid%3Dmz1wL63nCjQ2rr_USBWSNQ%26cbp%3D12,96.01,,0,-0.51">EA</a> offices.  In BN, everything is very nicely decorated: large spaces, huge desktops, many figurines of game characters, posters and other souvenirs.  Even after 6 pm, half the employees are at work.  EA in the office did not drive.  Only showed a presentation on what they are cool and a couple of trailers (there was no insider).  From 30 minutes of a dull story, I highlighted one thought: every year, EA publishes fewer games and earns more and more from them. <br><br>  This novelty for me is over. <br><br><h4>  What it looks like </h4><br>  Everything took place in a huge congress center.  The conference occupied a ‚Äúbasement‚Äù room in one of the buildings. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhikharev/5198182914/" title="Orange man by zhikharev, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad5/102/15b/ad510215bde99c9cee3c5473a2fa823c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Orange man"></a> <br><br>  Hall with stands and mini-bar with coffee and mini croissants. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhikharev/5183868975/" title="Expo hall by zhikharev, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a2/e79/976/0a2e7997638101c3bb57006dbb19e4c8.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Expo hall"></a> <br><br>  One half of the room was occupied with tables (80 pieces), the other - with rooms (160). <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhikharev/5184466894/" title="Meeting hall by zhikharev, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c4c/f5d/d4a/c4cf5dd4a65b1cd27b7c88d5d7cc1dde.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Meeting hall"></a> <br><br>  Several regional zones were distinguished: Mexicans, British, Brazilians, Spaniards, and of course the French. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhikharev/5183868617/" title="Mexican game companies by zhikharev, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ca/07d/f2e/9ca07df2e107ea8f8b816b19f37a6246.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Mexican game companies"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhikharev/5184044139/" title="Games from Spain by zhikharev, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a0/76c/9f9/0a076c9f91330c1868ae284704a2a68e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Games from Spain"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhikharev/5184043405/" title="Game Connection booth plan by zhikharev, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1427/5184043405_d0f617390d.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Game Connection booth plan"></a> <br><br>  Ours (in the broad sense of the word) would also have accumulated on such a separate zone, but the idea was rejected, probably because no common name could be given to this group of companies except ‚ÄúRussian-speaking‚Äù. <br><br>  Canadians invited to build a business in Canada.
