It wants to be especially emphasized - Nabbber helps to learn new words. <br>  There is no grammar, no audio and video courses.  Here in general all the content is created by the users themselves.  This is the main advantage of the site. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Say, for sites that offer to learn words on cards, one problem is the actual number of these cards and the words in them.  Words are added by editors, and their number is limited.  At Nabbber there is no such problem, because here every user is an editor, and the user's home page is one big card where words of other users are added. <br><br><h4>  Why do you need it? </h4><br><h6>  First, to replenish vocabulary with interesting and useful words. </h6><br>  Where is the confidence that they will be interesting?  So after all you decide whom to read, and whom - not. <br>  You can invite friends, you can find people about your level of language, see their words and, if you like them, subscribe. <br><br><h6>  Secondly, Nabbber saves time </h6><br>  How, for example, do you replenish vocabulary?  Most likely, watch movies or TV shows and read books in a foreign language. <br>  A great option, but with one drawback - it takes a lot of time. <br>  Now imagine that after watching the next series of your favorite series, everyone shares the learned words with others. <br>  If you are subscribed to 10 people and each of them will share five words - a total of 50 words will turn out. <br>  Fifty high-quality, commonly used words from people of the same level with you.

    <h4>  Nuances </h4><br><h6>  Why do you need the Like button under the words? </h6><br>  Clicking this button will add a word to the Likes page, where you can always repeat the words you especially liked. <br><br><h6>  How to add an example of using a word? </h6><br>  Around the example, put an underscore: _example_ (after adding, the example will have an indent on the left, and also it will be written in italics). <br><br><h6>  What if my friend teaches both English and French, and I only speak English? </h6><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/fa/3f/fa3fa2a389a85e68e1020b93bd5969b6.png" alt="Words from other users"></div><br>  Especially for such cases, Nabbber invented message filtering.  By subscribing to your friend, you can choose the languages ‚Äã‚Äãwhose words you would like to see.  In our example, by subscribing to a friend, you can indicate that you only want to see English words from this user. <br><br><h6>  Translate words into native or explain them in foreign? </h6><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/d7/6a/d76a14e291b581ab78be20acbd0af4ff.png" alt="Words from other users"></div><br>  By adding a new word, you can translate it into your language, or you can explain it in a foreign language. <br>  For example, the phrase <i>to get cold feet</i> can be translated into Russian: ‚Äúto be frightened at the last moment‚Äù, but it can be explained in English: ‚Äúto get afraid of the last minute‚Äù. <br>  You can choose any of these options, but still the explanation is more interesting in the same language. <br><br>  Why? <br><br>  <i>First</i> , if you explain, for example, an English word in English, then your message will be useful to anyone who studies English - French, Chinese, Norwegians ... <br>  If you translate, only the Russian-speaking will be able to understand the message (the same French and Chinese, if they do not want, will not see this message at all - filtering them will help in this). <br><br>  <i>Secondly</i> , by explaining a word in the same language, you learn to formulate thoughts briefly, and this is very useful. <br><br>  But there are exceptions.  For example, when you want to find an analogue in your own language, you cannot do without translation: <br>  smart and quick - captures on the fly <br>  Indian summer - Indian summer <br>  flip-flops - flip flops <br><br><h4>  Idea </h4><br>  I study as a linguist and translator, and sometimes we are with a group mate who also loves English, discussing newly learned words. <br>  It turns out similar dialogues: <br>  ‚ÄúDo you know what it means <i>to get cold feet</i> ?‚Äù <br>  - No, what? <br>  - Get scared at the last minute. <br>  - Ha, you will need to remember.  And I recently met <i>A who's who</i> <br>  - And what's that? <br>  - Elite, ‚Äúcream of society‚Äù <br><br>  It was then that it was thought, but what if you exchange not with one person, but with several? <br><br><h4>  Further development </h4><br>  The site was inspired by Getting Real, so I made the minimum of the necessary functionality.  Now I would like to get feedback and suggestions, then think carefully about them and start adding new features. <br><br>  Actually, that's all.  Follow the further development of the site on Twitter - <a href="http://twitter.com/nabbber">@nabbber</a> <br><br>  I invite interested persons to register (you can log in via Facebook, Twitter or Google) and share words (Twitter does not give an email, so if you want to receive notifications when someone subscribes to you or leaves a comment on your message, you can manually enter an email to page Settings). <br><br>  <a href="http://nabbber.com/">Nabbber.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107608/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107608/</a></p>
