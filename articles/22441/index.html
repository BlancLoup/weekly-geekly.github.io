  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Handheld computers: where is progress?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today I pondered over the question: What is happening in general with the pocket computer market?  Indeed, over the past 4 years, the situation has not changed.  Palm Tungsten T3 was released in October 2003, 4 and a half years ago.  Earlier, in April 2003, Palm Tungsten C came out, which, with the exception of a smaller screen, was even better because it had built-in WiFi.  In August 2004, HP released the iPaq hx4700 - so far, in my opinion, one of the best PDAs - I bought it last summer, when my Palm died a brave death after I forgot it on the trunk of a car. <br><br>  So, qualitatively for 4 (or even 5) years nothing has changed, and this <a name="habracut"></a>  grieves.  VGA screen was.  The processor is still the same - Intel XScale, which even then could work at 624 MHz.  WiFi and Bluetooth - nothing has changed.  The same Windows Mobile brake operating system, which, as I recently found out with surprise, is based on the Windows NT4 kernel.  Support for memory cards has become even worse - now there is rarely where you can find support for both Compact Flash and SD cards at the same time.  The only breakthrough is MultiTouch on the iPhone, and he also managed to start off, removing any support for memory cards and the ability to write programs for it.  But they added a whole bunch of unnecessary options in principle, the quality of which leaves much to be desired.  Any cameras that often have noise in terms of signal-to-noise.  Built-in GPS - why, when can I buy a Bluetooth GPS module that will work with anything, for only $ 40?  Communicators are more expensive than a separate phone and PDA, often inheriting the disadvantages of both.  I haven‚Äôt met with the Nokia N800 yet, but I don‚Äôt see a single point on which it is better than my four-year-old hx4700 except for the screen, but this is also a moot point, because even on a VGA screen you can't see everything.  And the processor on Nokia is more modest. <br><br>  This is my first post, so do not hit hard.  I just still think that the phone is needed in order to talk on it, the camera is to take pictures, and the PDA to work and mix everything into one device is completely unnecessary because the quality will suffer.  I do not want to offend anyone - I also have a Nokia and iPod phone, I am completely satisfied with the quality, it just seems to me that progress is being taken along the path of marketers, and the opinion of buyers is not particularly taken into account.
