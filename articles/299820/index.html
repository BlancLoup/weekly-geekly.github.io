Now it's time to try these tools in practice.  We suggest starting with a case on targeted advertising in social networks on the example of an online furniture store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b27/a54/767/b27a54767f3524fecc7e00dc03a87412.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The material was prepared with the participation of Artem Sova, head of targeted advertising for ArrowMedia (Kokoc Group). <a name="habracut"></a>

      We decided to draw an analogy with human relations and, using their example, tell how to ‚Äúfall in love‚Äù with the consumer.  We take a serious relationship as an indicator of success in private life, and in targeted advertising in social networks - the share of advertising expenditure (DDR), which shows the ratio of costs and real money received by the advertiser. <br><br>  <b>Step number 1. Who to choose?</b> <br><br>  So, imagine that you met a man who constantly talks about himself and is not at all interested in your hobbies.  Unpleasant, right?  It is unlikely that you want to continue acquaintance and, especially, to start a relationship with him.  Same story with online shoppers.  Before advertising a product to each user of all social networks indiscriminately, you need to find out who they are - your customers? <br><br>  Acquainted with the buyers of our online furniture store, we learned that they are wonderful people of 35‚Äì44 years old who are interested in posts in social networks on the topics of family, business and entertainment.  Most of them (45%) quickly make a purchase decision when they first visit the site.  Another 35% love to think from 12 to 30 days. <br><br>  We obtained all this data using Google Analytics and Top.Mail.ru: <br><br>  Age - segmenting site traffic in the report ‚ÄúAudience‚Äù Google Analytics: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/169/487/808/1694878083fe4bcfb89250954cfe7ab5.jpg"><br><br>  Decision time - in the report ‚ÄúMultichannel Google Analytics sequences‚Äù in the ‚ÄúTime to conversion‚Äù tab: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/870/09f/cf2/87009fcf2a6849ef9c09edbc735c9c38.jpg"><br><br>  We took into account the interests of the audience when choosing communities in social networks, and data on the time of the decision prompted the need to work with pent-up demand.  The last task will cope remarketing. <br><br>  By the way, admit, at least deep down, that no, no, yes, look at the partner of a friend or girlfriend?  This is not scary, but in Internet marketing it is even useful: do not be lazy to study the data on the target audience of your competitors, using, for example, the analytics of the VKontakte community audience. <br><br>  This can be viewed using Cerebro Target, specifying a link to a competitor‚Äôs community, and in the ‚ÄúDatabase Filter‚Äù section. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0c/8c6/5ad/a0c8c65ad01045cbbdc29f01c104c427.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Step number 2. Where to start the hunt?</b> <br><br>  So, you can already imagine what kind of girl or young man you need.  Now you need to understand where to look for them.  It is unlikely that you will find a vegetarian in a meat restaurant, and an avid party-goer in a library.  So it's time to explore the audience sites: that is, ask your friends where they found a pair. <br><br>  In our case, the choice fell on ‚ÄúClassmates‚Äù and ‚ÄúMy World‚Äù, whose average age of users is 25‚Äì44 years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56f/779/fd8/56f779fd8c574813af7f99d8cff193ca.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d86/391/654/d86391654d154be082fb1afe409a533b.jpg"><br><br>  Information about users of social networks was obtained from the blog and the Statistics section of Brand Analytics, and data on advertising activity of competitors in social networks was obtained using the Poobler Wildo service, where you can find advertisements for the domain and keywords. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4a/a47/30e/e4aa4730e8ca4315949980cf1c156c6b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Step number 3. How to cause interest?</b> <br><br>  To win the attention of one girl can be a bouquet of flowers, the other is better to invite to the theater and introduce her mother, but remember that each of them wants to be surprised.  It is understandable, because people are interested in everything unusual.  Social network users are no exception. <br><br>  A couple of years ago, text-and-graphic banners measuring 90 √ó 75 pixels were effective for promotion, but today they are classics that will not surprise anyone.  Most users no longer pay attention to them, as pedestrians walk past a promoter distributing flyers at the subway.  Therefore, the CTR for such formats is, on average, 0.04%. <br><br>  So we used the new format of native advertising - large-format banners 1080 √ó 607 pixels, which last year launched ‚ÄúOdnoklassniki‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy World‚Äù, and behind them ‚ÄúVKontakte‚Äù.  This ad is adapted to the social network news feed, it is perceived by visitors as organic content and increases brand loyalty without causing irritation. <br><br>  The format turned out to be effective: the average CTR reached 3%.  With a minimum rate of 3 rubles / click for desktops, coverage reached 81% of the audience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/793/b42/69e/793b4269ed7647d2bc02aca74a42a884.jpg"><br><br>  And if the success of a girl can be understood by her enthusiastic look or invitation to visit, then to assess the effectiveness of wide-format banners, we built a graph that clearly demonstrates the results before and after loading wide-format banners in the news feeds into advertising campaigns. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea7/e2a/5a0/ea7e2a5a07b64e44a67cb6251cc1075b.jpg"><br><br>  As you can see, the consumption has decreased, and the amount of traffic has increased significantly, due to the increase in CTR advertising campaigns. <br>  <b>Step number 4. How to prepare the right creative?</b> <br><br>  Trying to surprise a potential partner, the main thing is not to overdo it: not every young person will want to spend the evening on soap making courses.  And then it's time to ask about the successful experience of friends, and in the case of advertising in social networks - competitors. <br><br>  The response of the target audience to various combinations of images and text can be studied using the already mentioned Publer Wildo.  Before developing our own creatives, we selected the category "Target @ mail", the tab "Web-feed" and set the following search conditions: <br><br><ul><li>  The keyword "sofa"; </li><li>  Ads placed from 5 days over the past month. </li></ul><br>  - and chose the most popular ads to explore. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35d/409/17c/35d40917c5324932b705a7838c7d89b7.jpg"><br><br>  Step number 5. How not to miss the chance? <br><br>  Imagine that after the first date he or she does not call and does not agree to continue the relationship, and you have already planned the wedding.  Need to regain interest!  If in private life decisive steps are necessary for this, then in social media advertising it is enough to use remarketing. <br><br>  Visitors who have not made a purchase, we returned using the counter Top.  Mail.ru, which created the audience collection scenarios: <br><br><ul><li>  View three or more pages of the site - to return the most interested visitors to the site; </li><li>  Cart visit - to return the highest conversion users who visited the cart but did not complete the order; </li><li>  View a specific category of goods (sofas, living rooms, bedrooms); </li><li>  Visiting the card of the top product, which is most often bought - to display ads with this product; </li><li>  Making a purchase - for exclusion from advertising campaigns aimed </li><li>  to attract new customers, as well as for advertising campaigns for upsale (pre-sales). </li></ul><br><br>  And do not be afraid to experiment both in relationships and in remarketing.  For example, we tested various combinations: we chose a group of users who viewed at least three pages of the site, visited a popular product card and a basket, but did not place an order. <br><br>  These users were shown an ad with a call to complete the purchase of this particular product.  As a result, remarketing coverage amounted to about 45% of all transactions. <br><br>  <b>Step number 6. What entice?</b> <br><br>  Another way to get the attention of a girl or a young man is to demonstrate the best qualities.  Someone has a sense of humor, attentiveness and respect, and at online stores, of course - the goods.  In order to show it as efficiently as possible to visitors who left the site without an order, it is useful to use the dynamic remarketing tool. <br><br>  It differs from the classic one in that it shows the advertisement of exactly the product that was viewed.  This offer will have a high conversion, because it meets the expectations of users.  Reducing the cost of traffic and attracted orders will be a nice bonus. <br><br>  By the way, dynamic remarketing is easy to manage, since ads are created automatically based on the price list (product feed).  The only condition for working with him is at least 100 units of goods. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5c/094/ef1/d5c094ef1c20477ca540ff0090c09731.jpg"><br><br>  If a girl or a young man appreciated your promo action, there will be a second date.  In our case, to track the effectiveness of the advertising campaign, a Top.Mail.ru counter and a dynamic remarketing code were installed on each page of the site, which can be obtained from the MyTarget help in the appropriate section. <br><br>  The result was the coverage of 98% of users at the minimum cost of attracting 3 rubles / click and a high level of conversion of RK due to the maximum relevance of the proposal. <br><br>  On average, up to 30% of transactions on the source MyTarget accounted for exactly the tool of dynamic remarketing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cec/e4b/54e/cece4b54e2e3443c8d900ac86417909f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Step number 7. How to get more?</b> <br><br>  So, all the previous steps have borne fruit, your partner is almost ready to associate life with you, or at least part of it.  At this point, the main thing is to consolidate success and go on the offensive from an unexpected side.  The guy can be let go to a party with an old girlfriend, without torturing bouts of jealousy, and ask the girl to meet her parents. <br><br>  If we talk about advertising in social networks, it is worth adding to the existing audience of Odnoklassniki and My World users of VKontakte - but only those who visit Mail.ru sites, for example, Lady Mail.ru, Real Estate Mail .ru "or" Auto Mail.ru ". <br><br>  To do this, you need to collect the user IDs of VKontakte using the already well-known service Cerebro Target. <br><br>  We chose an ID collection strategy based on these user interests: <br><ul><li>  Subscribe to a brand group; </li><li>  Subscribe to groups of competitors; </li><li>  Subscription to thematic groups (furniture, family) </li></ul><br><br>  After collecting the ID held a split test and showed advertising online store: <br><br><ul><li>  Users consisting of at least three thematic groups (the segment is selected based on the increased interest of people in the product); </li><li>  Members of the community of competitors and brand (segment is selected, because users are preparing to buy). </li><li>  For users who have been active in the community (likes, reposts) for the last 14‚Äì30 days (the segment is selected, therefore the offer is most relevant for this group of people).  Targeting by user ID VKontakte brought an additional 5-7% of advertising revenue in MyTarget. </li></ul><br>  <b>And what is the result?</b> <br><br>  Perhaps our tips will help you find your soul mate, but our main goal was to show how to run a targeted advertising campaign on social networks:) and the results it can bring. <br><br>  In our case, the monthly income of the online store from advertising in social networks managed to increase by 3 times (from 367 thousand rubles to 1,128 million rubles), and the DDR indicator - to decrease from 18.6% to 10.6%. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.cossa.ru/216/120618/">Cossa</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299820/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299820/</a></p>
