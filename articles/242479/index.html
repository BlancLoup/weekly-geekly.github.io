At first this question threw us into a slight bewilderment, but over time we got used to it.

      In fact, this article will be devoted to a detailed answer to this difficult question and, I hope, will benefit some people who want to improve the conversion rates of their site, as well as some optimizers who may work with one of these people in the future. . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec4/016/160/ec4016160e8192dbaf62a79411873f42.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Conversion.  What is this? </h4><br>  Over the past six months, I have begun to really get sick of this little word, and the point here is not even that every day I say this word at least 100 times in various circumstances, but rather that I hear it from other people in three times more often. <br><br>  In fact, I want to say sincere thanks to the guys from various Business sects, who made a real cult from this word and made a bunch of imbeciles to rush with it like a flag, across the expanses of the RuNet and measure its indicators as if you know what.  So, <a href="http://ru.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25CA%25EE%25ED%25E2%25E5%25F0%25F1%25E8%25FF_(%25E2_%25E8%25ED%25F2%25E5%25F0%25ED%25E5%25F2-%25EC%25E0%25F0%25EA%25E5%25F2%25E8%25ED%25E3%25E5)">conversion</a> is the ratio of the number of site visitors who performed any target actions on it (hidden or direct instructions from advertisers, merchants, content creators ‚Äî purchase, registration, subscription, visiting a certain page of the site, following the advertising link), to the total the number of visitors to the site, expressed as a percentage.  That's all.  The concept itself is very simple and general, and does not contain any magic of unicorns. <br><br>  I often have to see examples when there is a good conversion on the company's website, for example, in filling out an order form, but for some reason there are few customers.  When we start to understand what's the matter and go all the way for a potential client, it often turns out that the problem is in some trifles, for example, the text of the landing page does not indicate the price of the product, which in fact is much larger than the client expects or is running some idiotic action, for example, ‚Äúfill out our form and get pizza from our partners‚Äù.  You have no idea how many such mistakes even serious companies make. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29b/997/9b4/29b9979b4c4d84f80d861711ebde5288.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And it happens that the error does not concern the site at all.  For example, I recently heard a story about how one person tried to buy a new, very expensive car of a representative class, a well-known brand, for which he left a request on the relevant website, to which he received a response from the administrator of the auto center ‚ÄúSorry, I can‚Äôt call you as I leave for vacation, I will return such and such number ¬ª.  Well, what would you do with such a seller?  How far would you send this guy on vacation if you found out how much damage he did to your company with an idiotic letter? <br><br>  So, my advice to an internet business, which I may be taking away from myself.  :) Before you begin to carry out serious work on optimizing the conversion funnel on your site, perform a simple logical analysis to begin with.  Perhaps the situation can be improved by changing just a couple of words in the selling text or dismissing some bastard manager. <br><br><h4>  How is this done? </h4><br>  First of all, the work on optimizing the site for a specific audience begins with the study of this audience.  You need to understand who these people are and what they want.  For us, as optimizers, this task is a bit simpler, we just need to understand who the people who are already going to the site are, analyze their behavior and offer them what will lead them to the desired action.  For an Internet businessman, this may become a matter for a long time, because, firstly, he most likely doesn‚Äôt have a couple of analysts in the background, and secondly, he needs to understand who his clients are, even before came to his site, otherwise he simply will not be able to properly set up an advertising campaign, and if he decides to experiment and create several advertising campaigns for several target audiences at once, then he will have to make several different landing pages, and this event is quite expensive. <br><br>  Now, thank God, a simple tool has appeared, which is called <a href="http://multi-landing.net/">multilending</a> and, as far as I know, it is provided by several companies in the Russian Internet, including <a href="http://multi-landing.net/">ours</a> .  Multilending allows you to tailor your landing page to any of your contextual ads.  Turning on any ad from your contextual advertising, your client will see exactly the version of the landing, which was prepared specifically for him - and here opens up an incredible scope for experiments.  Although there is another way to get to know your customer without spending a dime at all, and it is called customer development :) <br><br>  As soon as you know who you work with and for whom, it is time to build hypotheses and test them.  At this stage, several variants of text and design are created, which, in your opinion, will raise the conversion rate.  Then these options are crammed into a resource that conducts A / B tests - there are a lot of such in the world, here‚Äôs a review of the resources for <a href="http://prozhector.ru/publications/vypusk-58/24-instrumenta-split-testirovaniya-povyshayushchie-konversiyu-sayta-/">split testing</a> , choose any (by the way, we also have there :) and the time of endless numbers and graphs begins, if you come to him seriously, it will never end. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae5/64a/8b4/ae564a8b449aa9f22981f5be34ce069a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, A / B tests allow you to understand which of the two variants of the page works better.  True, there is a problem - if you have too little traffic or too few users perform a conversion action, the A / B test will simply lie, because there will be no data to compile the correct statistics.  In general, some analysts believe that the results of split-testing are true only if there are at least 100 conversions per option - well, here everyone is crazy in their own way, I suggest using special calculators, <a href="http://www.artmetod.ru/a-b-testing/230">like this</a> , where all the data are driven , and he says whether the result is truthful. <br><br>  If you have enough attendance and conversions, you can afford a multivariate test, which involves several options for text and design.  In general, testing is the main means of increasing conversion.  It is a pity that in the framework of this article I can not focus on all the intricacies of this process, and, believe me, there are many, good, Habr√© didn‚Äôt write about it just the lazy one. <br><br>  As soon as the hypotheses are verified, the time comes to form new ones, and so on to infinity, because the improvement of the site is a continuous process.  We, for example, torment the client‚Äôs site for an average month, until we achieve a good result. <br><br><h4>  Why is it worth the money? </h4><br>  Because at your site in any optimization company, at least 3-4 people are working who get paid and, of course, there are several other people in the company who are not directly involved in the process, who also need to pay something.  Add more expenses here, for example, on the same advertisement. <br><br>  Turning to the professionals, you will undoubtedly spend a considerable amount of money, so in order to understand whether you are ready for this, try to calculate in advance how much money will bring you an increase in the purchase conversion on your site, for example, by 10-15 percent in the next month and if this indicator discourages at least a third of the agency‚Äôs services, the transaction may well be successful.  If this simple economy has not converged, then, in my opinion, the best option remains - learn how to do it yourself and you will get many times more, moreover - completely free. <br><br>  Best regards, <a href="http://generate.club/">Generate.club</a> team. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242479/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242479/</a></p>
