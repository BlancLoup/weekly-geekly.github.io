  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Three plus one: Gearbest's birthday</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We are 3 years and 12 months old - and nothing else.  In China, the figure of our age is the most unlucky number, and I don‚Äôt want to think about it, when, as the postman Pechkin said, we can only begin to live, the marketplace has been translated into Russian, the marketplace has been opened, millions of fans and hundreds of haters have found.  This is our 85th article on Giktaymes, a site that for us in Russia has become the key to the hearts of the most severe, demanding, attentive - literally professional - geeks.  Well, that is you.  We have a bit of totals, a mountain of coupons, and something else.  After all, following the Chinese tradition, birthday presents to the birthday.  He gives a part of his soul and thanks for attention.  Do you know how many views we scored on Hiktayms?  We counted - a shock figure! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aaa/d81/7e2/aaad817e23222384d00165d297268a49.jpg"></div><br>  <i>This is what we get on our nerves with pie after each of 84 posts on Geektimes.</i>  <i>And now we are sitting, eating, nervous, waiting for congratulations ... (copyright on the picture was not found, who knows the author - write, give the link)</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  How Xiaomi us 1 726 520 views scored </h2><br>  On November 3, 2015 we came to Geektimes with the first article about an action camera.  The take-off was successful and bright, the feedback was sharp and sometimes hard.  We saw directions in which we had to change, and we changed.  In total, we wrote 84 articles, received for them only 1,183 pluses and 691 minus, an average of +14 per article (although it was -5).  Readers of Geektimes wrote 5841 comments to our posts (in fact, more - frankly inadequate remarks and off-topic comments had to be rejected).  2610 people have added our articles to Favorites.  On average, each article scored 32,450 views (maximum 110+ thousand), a total of almost three million - 2,790,759. Of these, 1,726,520 brought us articles on ... Xiaomi (spoiler - in the next article this trend will receive a new pivot point). <br><br>  Let's say frankly, all these years were not easy, we worked with different platforms, evaluated the audience.  Here - perhaps the most difficult.  Therefore, we never lied and did not push through brands that we are not sure of ourselves.  This time we planned large-scale discounts with an eye to the techno-geek community (although we left the interactives for everyone).

    <h2>  What can you profit </h2><br>  For our birthday, we made an interesting gift that will be useful to all our users.  Gearbest has opened its <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/marketplace-c_12466/%3Flkid%3D10721409">marketplace</a> - a place where suppliers can sell all sorts of small and not-so-good goods: toys, wearable gadgets, accessories, and so on.  Earlier, Gerbest was just an online store, the appearance of marketplace will allow our customers to get more interesting products for reasonable money.  Some products especially impressed us, for example, the <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/store/store_372.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Megir</a> multifunctional quartz <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/store/store_372.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">watch line</a> .  The watches are quite inexpensive, and will please both the big ones and those who want to appear big.  In general, at least worth a look. <br><br>  Well, in the midst of our birthday, <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/m-promotion-active-403.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">landing time</a> and <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/m-promotion-active-412.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">landing two</a> <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/m-promotion-active-403.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">times</a> will function.  From March 20 to April 2, these pages will have real heat (well, at least somewhere it will be!).  It‚Äôs easy to get confused in a bunch of conditions, games, discounts and coupons, so we chose several products for you that can be snatched on March 21 and 22 for some ridiculous prices.  For example, a smartphone with a good dual camera for about 5,200 rubles or a laptop for something around 12,700 rubles. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_757529.html%3Fwid%3D4%3Flkid%3D10721409">XIAOMI Mi A1</a> - an interesting and popular smartphone.  Another model in the Mi.  It offers 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal memory, dual 12 megapixel camera, 5.5-inch screen, Android One operating system, 3080 mAh battery.  The smartphone is very cool in the hand, has a pleasant shape and allows you to work, and play, and watch videos, and chat.  On the flash-list it will be possible to snatch it for as much as $ 159.44, and those who do not have time will be able to buy a smartphone at another low price - $ 209.44.  Be warned - flashlight needs an eye and an eye, the quantity of goods is very limited. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bdb/90d/216/bdb90d2167e6eabbc23bb3582834c619.jpg"></div><br>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_1412159.html%3Fwid%3D4%3Flkid%3D10721409">OnePlus 5T</a> is a top 6-inch smartphone running Android 7.1 with 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of built-in, the most powerful gadget for working and the most sophisticated games.  The battery for such a device is quite trivial - 3000 mAh.  But the camera will force the owners of the majority of amateur cameras to save space in their bags and forget about the cameras - after all, we are talking about a dual camera of 16 Mp + 20 Mp.  As appendage - front camera 16 megapixels.  In general, there will be no problems with the brightness and clarity of the photo.  And, in fact, with such a smartphone there will be no problems in principle - maximum, it will hurt the feelings of the fans of the neighboring camp.  March 21, the smartphone will cost $ 529.44, do not miss! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/80c/5b1/1b9/80c5b11b94cf70d4821efa8a931d2b74.jpg"></div><br>  Not only smartphones live geeks.  The sale will get an interesting <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/laptops/pp_1050951.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">laptop YEPO 737A</a> - a 13.3-inch laptop with Windows 10 on board, an Intel Celeron N3450 Quad Core 1.1GHz processor, 6 GB of RAM and 64 GB of built-in, with a capacious 8000 mAh battery.  The laptop is quite thin and light - only 1.22 kg.  And on March 21 it will cost $ 219.44.  If anyone needs a laptop for travel, movies, cartoons, the Internet and working with text in large volumes, take it - it‚Äôs unlikely to find an analogue for such a price.  The only thing you need is an engraving of the keys (or stickers of the Russian layout), lovers will be able to change the OS configuration for themselves - it will turn out to be fire. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/10b/3dc/ff8/10b3dcff8ab1936c460a5d67ae034737.jpg"></div><br>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/ip-cameras/pp_693217.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">The Xiaomi smart camera</a> is another easy prey on sale, which will cost indecently on March 21st - $ 29.44.  The camera has a viewing angle of 120 degrees, can be integrated with elements of the smart home Xiaomi.  The camera has a night vision function, interphone, can be controlled using the application.  Probably its best use is for home security purposes and tracking the elderly, children or fluffy scoundrels, who remain at home unattended.  Well, of course, for an office circuit in a small company, too, will do. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ba/156/7a2/7ba1567a205ca6d72746f17afeefffea.jpg"></div><br>  If you think that dual cameras - the lot of expensive smartphones, then no - this camera is in <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_906061.html%3Fwid%3D11%3Flkid%3D10721409">Vernee Mix 2</a> , an excellent smartphone with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of built-in.  The main camera is dual, 13 megapixel + 5 megapixel.  This, of course, is not 20 Mp, but it does its job, the pictures are really juicy and pleasant.  Otherwise, the smartphone is pretty standard, with a 4200 mAh long-life battery.  We suggest an idea - soon something will need to be given to schoolchildren for the end of the year (they spoiled it!), If this is in your tradition, then before the summer an inexpensive smartphone with a good camera will please you, and it's not scary to take to the camp.  Moreover, on March 22 the phone will cost $ 89.44. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e55/060/774/e55060774ba849df22557c1ee45d8e0c.jpg"></div><br>  From the tablets will be available <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/tablet-pcs/pp_690462.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Teclast Master T10</a> - also March 22 at a price of $ 129.44.  This is a 10.1-inch tablet with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of built-in, with good cameras for the tablet breed and a very capacious 8100 mAh battery.  The tablet is not simchaty, so the entire Internet via Wi-Fi.  The device is quite heavy - 550 grams, the assembly is strong.  This can be given to a child or parents - it is convenient and pleasant to watch a video on it, the screen pleases.  For the price - give two. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/635/fbb/05a/635fbb05ab60dd66c09b9a524aefb29d.jpg"></div><br>  We have already written about the Xiaomi smart watch line.  At this time, a discount of up to $ 175.44 fell to the lot of <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/smart-watches/pp_1426629.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Xiaomi Huami Amazfit Smartwatch 2 Running Watch</a> .  Good, durable, stylish watch with GPS tracker, sleep monitor, alarm clock, message alerts, pedometer and calorie counter and survivable battery.  It seems that this model will look good only on a man's hand, but no - on an elegant female wrist, they look like an accessory with character. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e0e/348/4f7/e0e3484f77713d7d50f03d68d088eeeb.jpg"></div><br><h2>  Walk so walk </h2><br>  By what will happen from March 20 to April 2, you can make a whole guide.

By the way, in Russia, the tradition of Easter sales of everything and everyone has not yet taken root, but abroad absolutely in all countries Easter Sale is another shopping boom, which they love not only for the range of discounts, but also for the wonderful promotional pages, postcards and everything else - with grass, rabbits and chickens.
