This is for me the biggest gift! <br>  I thank my young friends of like-minded people - Alexei, Alexandrov, Egor and Nikolai for their support. <br>  Now on the topic: I answer all one article, who will have questions or suggestions, contact in a personal: <br>  About the patent language: a conclusion from my own experience - the language is so hard that without the author it would be difficult to understand the details for fans of plagiarism. <br><br>  According to the invention of the bicycle drive: ‚Äúyou are going backwards going forward‚Äù - he invented it.  in the 50s of the last century, my compatriot Chkheidze, experienced a member of the USSR national team of those years, the current silver medalist of the world championship in track racing (Master category), honored coach of the USSR Albert Kolybin.  The training effect is, but no more. <br><br>  And now let's start in order:

      In December I will be 67, that is, 7 years of the second youth, just the time to go to the first class, which is what I am preparing for - the muscular-drive types of the new generation (superunit) equipment are in our portfolio. <br>  Vera Gusakova and Sergey Efimenko - my sister and son;  unfortunately, we are with them now not on the same territory - Vera in Smolensk, but Sergey in the Moscow region. <br><br>  Bicycle theme in Russia.  The official birth of a new generation of cycle gear - 16.08.  2002 at ZhVZ, Zhukovsky bicycle plant in Zhukovka, Bryansk region, which now ‚Äúordered to live long‚Äù, so that there are no bicycles in Russia left.  There are three collectors: "Stels" - Lyubertsy Moscow region;  "Forward" -d.  Froly Perm Region;  Element - Kaliningrad (K√∂ninsberg). <br><br>  Skarzhinsky Alexander Igorevich, Master of Sports (Bicycle Highway), General Designer and Director of TABrat-Sodruzhestvo LLC The design bureau of experimental engineering represents a new generation of muscular-drive types of equipment. <br><br><img src="http://atriam.ru/img/1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  1. Chronology of the birth and development of muscular-drive types of technology of the new generation. <br>  <b>On August 16, 2002,</b> we made the first prototype of a cycle drive of a new generation at ZhVZ in 5 hours on the basis of the serial Desna: 6 connecting rods and some tokars, assembled for welding.  I spent 1.5 hours, but I got a speed of 30km / h;  200m on the move with a head wind of 6 m / s. <br><img src="http://atriam.ru/img/2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>In the photo: the left (jog leg) - lever-crank pair is open, the extension tube has burst on the right side</i> . <br><br><img src="http://atriam.ru/img/3.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://atriam.ru/img/4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>October 22-24, 2002</b> - I performed a single bike ride along the Smolensk-Minsk-Smolensk route with a length of 638 km., On one gear 51/15 = 3.4 = 95 inches with a load of 24 kg.  The weight of the ‚ÄúTourist KhVZ‚Äù bicycle is 21kg., Climatic conditions: -7 degrees of frost when leaving Smolensk and further rains;  the length of the middle stage is 213 km;  Duration - 13.7 hours;  average speed of 15.5 km / h;  the conversion ratio of efforts by a cycle drive is equal to 2.49 times or 149% higher than that of the serial counterparts. <br><br>  <b>The period of 2003-2007 was</b> based at the Department of Cycling and Skating Sports of the Smolensk State Institute of Physical Culture, Sports and Tourism in collaboration with Anatoly Leontyev MSMK in cycling, repeated prize winner of the USSR championships in racing on the track and highways athletics, the repeated prize-winner of the USSR championships, theoretical studies and laboratory tests of the third generation of the cycle drive were carried out, which eventually ended with the filing of an application for patent in the patent  but-law firm "Eustis" in Moscow ... <br><br>  <b>On January 18, 20, 2004,</b> tests were conducted on the Krylatskoye cycle track under the patronage of the patriarch of the Russian cycling Gennady Martynov and the honored cyclist of Russia Albert Kolybin;  the result of exceeding the conversion effort was confirmed. <br><br>  <b>On 27 August 2007,</b> obtaining a patent of the Russian Federation No. 65857 for the utility model ‚ÄúBicycle (options), its drive, trailer for a bicycle and a kit containing a bicycle and a trailer.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>January 14, 2008</b> - a new generation of muscular-drive types of equipment, in the form of a bicycle and a trailer for it, gets an official start in life from the President of the Moscow Cycling Federation Terenin AV?  Academician of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences, RAMTN, ABOP, Doctor of Economics, professor, who approved the positive conclusion of the cycling examination of the patent and the K28A project. <br><br>  On participation in the project stakeholders (extract from the Examination). <br>  The Commission recommends that interested parties take an active part in the creation and development of new technologies in cycle engineering and the branches of muscular-drive types of transport and energy supply, aimed at improving the health of man and the environment. <br><br>  <b>On April 19, 2008,</b> comparative tests of a second-generation bicycle drive were carried out on a small Krylatskoye cycle path in Moscow, the result of a super-delicate effort conversion confirmed. <br><br>  <b>Autumn 2008</b> - 125 years of Russian and 140 years of world cycling.  Led by machinery - filigree nowhere, but in fact - the transformation of effort remained at the level of the 40s of the last century - the invention of gear shifting. <br>  <b>November 20, 2009</b> Obtaining a patent of the Russian Federation No. 2373101 for the invention ‚ÄúBicycle (options), bicycle wheel, bicycle drive, bicycle lever mechanism, bicycle pedal mechanism and a kit containing a bicycle and a trailer‚Äù. <br>  <b>December 29, 2010</b> - the village of Petropavlovka, Kuraginsky District, Krasnoyarsk Territory;  winter trials on conventional highway tires;  The effect exceeds all expectations. <br><br>  Further, though briefly, the history of all the runs and tests was decided that it was not worth it - it would be too long for the article to work out, therefore now it‚Äôs about the benefits;  I will only say that this second-generation copy (see photo) made it possible to create the third generation in sketching drawings, wooden and aluminum-cast models and laboratory tests. <br><br>  <b>Advantage 1</b> <br>  The increase in the torque moment of the torque without changing the rotation radius is 170 mm (in the second generation it was 200 mm, since it did not cut the connecting rod a second time to shorten it to 170 mm, but these 17% in the final table of the test report are under the minus). <br>  According to the law of theoretical mechanics, they say, this does not pass, but since it is not studied at the institute of physical culture, I designed it as a cyclist and machine operator (crane operator).  His friend Vitaly, the lead designer of the Almaz-Service plant in Smolensk (technological drawings for the patent were made with him), had to explain this technical hitch as follows: ‚Äúcombine the laws of biomechanics and thermomech, and then scroll it over time‚Äù;  after that we started to create.  So great with a trailer and a "cart for coal" (a comment from HabraHabr) is his electronic work. <br><br><img src="http://atriam.ru/img/5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The second generation cycle drive "Concord - Orlik";</i>  <i>the total mileage on it was 1000km;</i>  <i>The average coefficient of effort conversion in the three types of tests was 2.167 times higher than that of the serial counterparts.</i> <br><br>  <b>The schematic diagram of the new cycle drive is as follows:</b> <br>  Mc = F * L - from the pedal to the carriage shaft, further to the circumference - F * L = Mcr (-) in the direction of rotation, but when the intermediate kgm (force) is transmitted to the shaft of the carriage with a 170 mm arm, we get kgm2;  according to the SI system - momentum, I don‚Äôt know what it is in theory, but in practice it meant that after 250 km on the right side, and after km.  70 on the left side, the carriage axle wedge saddle was broken into half, it was necessary to insert gaskets under the new wedges. <br>  In the third generation, this is the only weak point we have eliminated. <br>  I can say with confidence that this advantage gives the excess torque output torque by 100%.  On the track in Krylatskoye, an excess of 111% was obtained, since the profile is mountainous and short distance (4300m), therefore the following advantage of the accelerator effect worked inefficiently, but an example from the 2002 run: <br>  In a single run, 638 km traveled in 3 days on one gear 51:15 = 3.4 = 95 inches;  The total weight of the biotechnological complex was 110 kg., I was 65 kg.  The average stage was 213 km., The duration of 13.7 hours.  The number of revolutions of the pedals = 84411 revolutions;  average speed 15.5 km / h, wheel circumference 28 dm.  - 2,233m;  The effect of conversion efforts in the run at 149% excess over serial counterparts. <br><br><img src="http://atriam.ru/img/6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Kinematic scheme of the third generation cycle drive "Concord - Boomerang"</i> <br><br>  <b>Advantage 2</b> <br>  1. The effect of accelerators.  The bottom line: converting the potential energy of mass (1.7 kg) into kinetic energy of rotation for each revolution of a full pedaling cycle, so this is not counterbalances and not an ellipsoid asterisk (to the commentary on HabraHabr√©). <br>  2. Due to the specific location of the accelerator center of gravity, in idle mode a constant starting position of the jogging pedal occurs. <br><br>  <b>Advantage 3</b> <br>  Boomeranobraznost cranks (connecting rods), jumpers in the hub of the central sprocket front block and in the flanges of the wheels.  Effects: <br>  1. Eliminates a common dead point in the foot-pedal system;  has a constant shoulder torque moment - 58mm. <br>  2. Increases the path of optimal pressure and thrust for a full pedaling cycle by 560. 3. At the sprocket hub and in the flanges of the rear wheel, boomerangousness reduces the resistance to rotation and increases the efficiency of thrust, respectively. <br><br>  <b>Advantage 4</b> <br>  Pedal mechanism - direct contact of the person and the type of MP technology;  tested on a bicycle ergometer.  The sensations are fantastic ... for the most lacked our very modest resources. <br><br>  Effects: <br>  1. The pedal's specific pressure on the foot decreases to unity and becomes the same in size as that of a person standing on his feet, but with intensive blood circulation and metabolism in them.  When walking, and even more so when running, the specific pressure of the sole on the foot becomes greater than one, since a shock load appears. <br>  2. The change in the value of the average shoulder of the torque torque by 31.25% (189 mm) for the full pedaling cycle, with R = 170 mm.  in the upper and lower positions;  for comparison: in the classic of cycling - 144 mm., also at R = 170mm;  The effect appears due to the separation of the axes of rotation, pressure and thrust between them. <br>  3. Gives the possibility of complete relaxation of the leg muscles in the phase of pressure, without loss of rotational efficiency, due to the use of the weight of the legs and body.  In the phases of the back half of the circumference, the biceps and quadriceps muscles of the thigh work. <br>  4. It makes it possible to use the cycle drive all season, as the pedal adapts to any warm footwear. <br><br>  <b>Advantage 5</b> Changing the idle configuration. <br>  1. It enables the use and accumulation of the kinetic energy of the entire mass of the biotechnological complex in the rotation of the chain and the front sprocket unit, that is, an inertial energy store appears that allows you to overcome the rises, and even more so to go in a straight line, above the descent rate. <br>  2. Translates the gear shift mode to an automatic transition of the circuit in idle mode, which increases the total time of muscle and subconscious relaxation in proportion to the number of switching, hence the maximum effect in the mountains. <br><br>  <b>Advantage 6</b> <br>  1. All this complex of advantages gives the possibility of setting the maximum gear ratio - 13 (restrictions on the diameters of stars) - this is the high-speed formula in cycling. <br>  2. In the comments (on HabraHabr√©) there was a conversation about the cardan gear on a bicycle;  he, cardan, will be just the way, with such an increase in torque, but more on the cycle car than on a bicycle. <br><br>  <b>Advantage 7</b> <br>  Since the power of our bicycle engine (transducer / propulsor) has increased several times, it is necessary to ensure its corresponding running gear and safety. <br>  1. Let's start with the wheels: the main quality of the drive wheel: the stiffness coefficient of the transmission of effort - <br>  K = DF / LSP., Where DF - the diameter of the flange, and LSP.  - the length of the needles; <br>  in production models: K = 50/250 = 0.2;  in our wheel: K = 420/70 = 6, the spokes of the aerodynamic shape, in my opinion everything is clear.  The stiffness coefficient of the transmission of forces in the wheel of a new generation is 30 times greater than the coefficient of the existing bicycle wheels. <br>  2. Next - the brake system: <br>  1) Disc rims that are installed on the flanges, 2 on each wheel;  the load (temperature) on the pads is reduced, and the braking efficiency increases 1.95 times. <br>  2) Brake machines are transferred to the base of the forks, which accordingly reduces the load on the forks of the forks when braking: <br>  K = 450 mm / 230 mm = 1.95 times, hence the overall efficiency ratio rises 3.95 times. <br>  3. The safety factor doubles with a possible failure of one of the brake systems, since in our variant the brake pairs work diagonally. <br><br>  <b>Advantage 8</b> <br>  The power consumption of the bike is increased up to 4 times due to the possibility of installing four generators (dynamos) with friction drive from the ends of the brake discs, which relieves lateral pressure from the wheel and eliminates the wear of the side surface of the rubber. <br><br>  <b>Advantage 9</b> <br>  Stationary instrument panel on all types of cycle engineering - gives the characteristics of the parameters of both the type of cycle equipment and the person (pulse, pressure and the level of "fitness", USF). <br><br>  <b>Advantage 10</b> <br>  Increased energy consumption in combination with a lithium-ion battery allows the use of automotive electrical equipment. <br><br>  <b>Advantage 11</b> <br>  Aerodynamic fairing is required due to increased speed <br><br>  <b>Advantage 12</b> <br>  1. Towing part of the bike, which provides the necessary stiffness coefficient of towing a trailer. <br>  2. The towing point allows the cyclist to enter a turn without the risk of overturning the trailer. <br>  3. Ensuring automatic braking of the trailer due to roll. <br>  4. Independent trailer wheel suspension makes it possible to tow it over rough terrain. <br>  5. The design of the cargo nacelle of a sports-tourist trailer variant makes it possible to compactly transport a bicycle and a trailer in other types of transport. <br><br>  <b>Advantage 13</b> <br>  The single cycle bike is formatted with the aid of a prefix in the form of an inertial storage of kinetic energy of rotation;  gives an output of 2.5 kW. <br><br>  <b>Advantage 14</b> <br>  Additional devices that give people a healing effect: <br>  1. Machines for determining the coefficient of the amount of health (the potential of the organism);  principle of action: a person enters a date of birth;  the machine determines the weight and height of a person;  when compressing the dynamometer arms for 7 seconds.  determines the susceptibility of the body to a certain load with measurements of the values ‚Äã‚Äãof heart rate (pulse) and blood pressure;  the result of the operation: the ratio of the amount of health in accordance with the logical-mathematical formula of the self-managed duration of active human longevity (certificate of authorship No. 08-181 of May 27, 2008). <br>  2. Indicator USF - on the dashboard of the bike (see advantage 9) <br><br>  <b>Advantage 15</b> <br>  A new generation of accessories is also needed for cycle equipment: <br>  1. Footwear - velotetki (from shtolzhetok), makes it possible that the full-support scheme of the full cycle of pedaling involves the inclusion of the quadriceps muscles of the thigh in the phases of thrust, as well as the activation of the muscles of the tibia in the phases of pressure;  The design of the new bicycle shoe is similar to the design of a rod shoe. <br>  2. Laid on compensatory-pneumatic device for the Pilot's chair of the velomobile.  It protects the pelvic organs and the spinal column from any shocks of the wheels, as well as prevents stagnation of blood in the pelvic organs. <br><br>  <b>Advantage 17</b> , the final. <br>  Users of muscular-drive types of technology of the new generation are able to restore, maintain and increase the amount of their health, as well as manage the process of their active longevity and contribute to an increase in the level of environmental cleanliness without additional time and material costs.  At the same time, users receive an additional economic effect in the form of all-season transport movement and autonomous household and small-scale industrial electricity on various types of MPs of the new generation. <br><br>  Sincerely, with respect, Sandro Kipiani (Alexander Skarzhinsky), who loves you, <br>  general designer of muscular-drive types of technology of the new generation, <br>  Director of TABrat-Sodruzhestvo LLC - design bureau of experimental engineering. <br><br>  <b>PS I</b> present to you a list of the first model line of cycle engineering of a new generation, which is ready in draft drawings and is waiting for technological design and patenting: <br>  1. Bike transport with trailer <br>  2. Bicycle sports and tourist with a trailer <br>  3. Bicycle sports (road) <br>  4.
