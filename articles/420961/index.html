  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Recruitment of a new level - using Ethereum</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The time in which we live has long been called the period of information decentralization.  More and more projects are moving away from storing information on one (or several) servers to using Blockchain technology.  Our team was honored to become part of a big idea - the development of a job search portal (Job Board), where the main part of the business logic is implemented on the so-called <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582">smart contracts</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w0/kq/o3/w0kqo3u-uqk51fbizv9lmk0o4iy.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe portal was a system in which each participant has his own ‚Äúcard‚Äù (an entity within the network blockchain), which has its own balance, facts about the owner (where he worked, studied, participated), with the possibility of confirming them.  In addition, each vacancy should have a custom test task, after which the applicant automatically receives a reward. <br><br><h2>  Development </h2><br>  Immediately after receiving and discussing the terms of reference, we began to write contracts.  Their first versions described the minimally necessary model of interaction between the employer and the applicant: the first could create vacancies, declare a reward for passing her test, the second - look for vacancies, get tested and receive remuneration for it. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      At this stage, we had 3 contracts: the employer, the applicant and the vacancy.  Problems of this approach: <br><br><ul><li>  The employer is the sole owner of a job - he must himself conduct a selection of applicants, or transfer his account in the system to a team of recruiters. </li><li>  All information on which vacancies the applicant has signed for is stored at this stage in the applicant's contract itself, which increases its size and, accordingly, the placement price. </li><li>  The same situation is with the vacancy contract - all information about the applicants subscribed to it was stored within the vacancy contract itself. </li></ul><br>  After brainstorming and a few liters of coffee, we came to the conclusion that it was necessary to create a single contract, let's call it an oracle, which will store information about all the participants and their actions.  It was also decided to abandon the contract vacancies in favor of recording in the contract of the oracle. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#9cc2ce">Version 1.0</font> </h2><br>  At this stage, a new entity - Oracle.  The employer's and applicant's contracts have not gone away, but now they have become proxy contracts necessary for identifying participants and performing their actions ‚Äî publishing vacancies, turning them on or off, subscribing to vacancies, receiving remuneration and transferring received tokens to their personal ETH accounts. <br>  At the same time, an idea came to us - why does each vacancy have only one rigidly assigned test for it?  Then the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating the Vacancy pipeline was born. <br><br><h4>  Pipeline </h4><br>  Our team leader, <a href="https://habr.com/users/kvarlamo/">Kirill Varlamov</a> , described the need to create the necessary functionality: <br><blockquote>  Recruiting is a funnel with filters.  The analogy is first a cheap coarse filter (test), then a more demanding fine filter (KYC / interview), then a clean filter (interview with a technical specialist). <br><br>  The simplest filter is a questionnaire review by an HR officer and approval or refusal to continue working with a candidate.  Another, costly and time-consuming option of the filter is a personal interview.  An advanced version is an automated test, cheap and passing without human intervention.  It may be, for example, the first or second in the chain of motion of the applicant. <br><br>  At this stage, it is unclear what sequence will work best and what is the cost of each step and efficiency.  Most likely, the cost and quality will be different for different employers and for different vacancies.  The employer should be able to customize the sequence of steps that the applicant is taking.  The architecture must support the extension of step types with new variants. <br><br>  The search engine-&gt; response-&gt; interview now implemented is not flexible enough and today does not allow us to describe a flexible step-by-step process. <br></blockquote><br>  The same evening, the first contract drafts appeared describing this functionality. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Contract code Pipeline.sol</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre><code class="javascript hljs">pragma solidity ^<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0.4</span></span><span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">.21</span></span>; contract Pipeline { struct Pipeline { bytes32 title; bool is_payable; bool is_approvable; } mapping (<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">address</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> =&gt;</span></span> uint256) public balances; Pipeline[] public stages; mapping(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">address</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> =&gt;</span></span> Pipeline) public candidate_stages; mapping(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">address</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> =&gt;</span></span> mapping(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">bytes32</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> =&gt;</span></span> bool)) candidate_paid_stages; <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">// ["first","second","third","four"],[false,true,true,false] function new_pipelines(bytes32[] _titles, bool[] _is_payable) public { require(_titles.length &lt; 10); require(_titles.length == _is_payable.length); for (uint8 i=0; i &lt; _titles.length; i++) { stages.push(Pipeline(_titles[i], _is_payable[i])); } } function new_candidate(address _candidate) public { candidate_stages[_candidate] = stages[0]; } function next_stage(address _candidate) public returns(bool) { for (uint8 i = 0; i &lt; stages.length - 1; i++) { if (stages[i].title == candidate_stages[_candidate].title) { candidate_stages[_candidate] = stages[i+1]; return true; } } } function test_pay_to_candidate(address _candidate) public { require(candidate_stages[_candidate].is_payable); require(!candidate_paid_stages[_candidate][candidate_stages[_candidate].title]); balances[_candidate] += 5; candidate_paid_stages[_candidate][candidate_stages[_candidate].title] = true; } }</span></span></code> </pre> <br></div></div><br>  Naturally, the code of this contract was greatly simplified, it was not tied to <br>  real tokens, there was no <abbr title="an acronym denoting four basic functions used when working with persistent data stores: create, read, edit, delete.">CRUD</abbr> to control actions, but the process was started, <br>  and we were not stopped.  For ourselves, we have defined several types of actions, from <br>  which pipeline was built: <br><br><ul><li>  Wait action - implies a clear expectation of approval from the employer. </li><li>  Exam action - test task.  It may contain from one question. <br>  one of several types - a question with one answer, with several answers and <br>  the question to which the applicant must give a detailed answer. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Quiz application</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  To compile the test tasks, a separate application was created in which questions <br>  divided into categories.  For each question and answer indicates the so-called weight, <br>  thanks to which the possibility of flexible adjustment of the passing score appears. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to automatically check a detailed response?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  For these purposes, we used the algorithm for finding the distance between the vectors, <br>  built on the basis of a knowingly correct answer and the answer of the applicant. <br></div></div></li><li>  Interview action - a live interview between the applicant and the employer. </li></ul><br>  Each action inside the pipeline had its reward, which the applicant received after successful completion, could be approvable - then the applicant had to wait for the moment when the employer checked the results of the answers, for example, on the exam action and ‚Äúadvance‚Äù the applicant to the next level. <br><br><h4>  Example pipeline eyes of the applicant </h4><br>  The screenshot below shows the most basic version of the pipeline.  It consists of 3 actions: <br><br><ol><li>  At the beginning, the employer wants to personally approve or reject the candidacy of the applicant, looking at his profile in the system, assessing his professional qualities and skills.  Waiting reward for the applicant - 10 tokens. </li><li>  The next step is a test task.  After the applicant answers the questions, the system will check his answers and, on the basis of the passing score, will make decisions, ‚Äúadvance‚Äù the candidate to the next action - an interview, or leave the employer the right to choose.  Reward - 5 tokens. </li><li>  At the end of the path of the applicant - an interview with the employer.  In the first version of the system, we used a simple chat application for communication between the employer and the applicant.  The reward for this step is 20 tokens. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a8/nh/68/a8nh68xmlw51h-nz5n2j2jdyntu.png"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Can you do more action?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The presented option describes only the most minimal option to configure filters.  Thus, an employer may not establish the actions of expectations and immediately begin with test tasks, which may be several (for example, the first test for knowledge of basic things, unpaid, the next ‚Äî more specialized, with a declared reward).  The number of actions is limited to the 6th in the basic version, and can be increased if necessary. <br></div></div><br>  At this stage, there were several unclosed options for using the system: <br><br><ul><li>  The actions of applicants are always checked by one person - the employer who posted the vacancy. </li><li>  The participant registered in the system is always either the applicant or the employer. </li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#9cc2ce">Version 2.0</font> </h2><br>  It was decided to abandon the roles of the participants of the system - now each user can, as before, view vacancies, respond to them, and also be an employee of the company.  To implement this functionality, contracts have been developed: <br><br><ul><li>  Oracle - the contract has not gone away, still described the entire logic of the system. </li><li>  Member is a system member‚Äôs contract.  Describes the methods of working with an oracle contract on the part of the participant, such as: creating vacancies, subscribing to vacancies, creating companies, managing members of the company and their roles, <abbr title="an acronym denoting four basic functions used when working with persistent data stores: create, read, edit, delete.">CRUD</abbr> to manage the vacancy pipeline. </li><li>  Company - the company's contract.  Now each vacancy belongs to the company, the reward for passing the pipeline is paid from its account. </li><li>  Facts is a new contract describing the possibility for any participant to add facts about themselves and other participants, to confirm the facts of other participants. </li></ul><br>  Thanks to the new system of relations, the participants had the opportunity to become part of companies, and the owners of companies - to choose their roles: owner, recruiter or simple employee. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Worker</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  On employees of the company, as well as on other roles, only one restriction is imposed - they cannot subscribe for vacancies of their company.  In addition, this role does not provide any privileges. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Recruiter</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Recruiters of the company have the right to configure actions within the pipeline - setting up exams (the number of questions, the questions themselves, passing score), interviews (setting the time for conducting, the minimum duration). <br>  In addition to actions to set up filters, recruiters, as the name implies, have the opportunity to check the results of applicants, conduct interviews, promote and reject candidates. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What is the minimum duration in the chat?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  By this time, we completely changed the interview system, and now this is not just a chat with a company employee, but an external service for video interviews, and new parameters have appeared for setting it up - the list of recruiters responsible for conducting it, the start and end date and time the minimum duration after which the system will consider the interview to take place.  For example, an employee of a company can set up an interview like this: I want to conduct an interview from January 1 to January 20, from 8:00 to 18:00, lasting for 10 minutes - now the system will offer time to which an employee of the company will get to this action. convenient to conduct an interview.  The applicant, however, has the right to change the automatically offered time, the main condition is that it should fall within the established framework and not be occupied. <br></div></div><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Owner</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The owners of companies received, in addition to the capabilities of all previous roles, the ability to create new vacancies, indicating the <abbr title="The maximum number of tokens that a vacancy can spend.">allowed amount</abbr> , build the initial pipeline, indicating the number of steps, their type and amount of remuneration. <br></div></div><br><h2>  <font color="#9cc2ce">results</font> </h2><br>  The final result of our work is a portal that fully satisfies the duties assigned to it. <br><br>  Steps necessary for posting a job: <br><br><ul><li>  Register and fill out your profile. </li><li>  Creating a company and crediting tokens to its account. </li><li>  Job posting, with a description of the necessary skills and abilities. </li><li>  Configuration and setup of vacancy pipeline. </li><li>  Inclusion of vacancy. </li></ul><br>  After these simple steps, your vacancy will appear in the general list of system vacancies, and applicants will be able to respond to it and try to go all the way from waiting for your approval to a personal conversation with you. <br><br>  If you are a job seeker and want to get a few tokens, and maybe work: <br><br><ul><li>  Register and fill out your profile.  Specify past jobs and basic responsibilities, level of education and institutions in which you studied, your achievements - so the employer will be able to better assess your skills, and you will have a chance to reach the end! </li><li>  On the vacancies page, find a job that suits you and subscribe to it. </li><li>  After passing the first step, if it is paid - you will receive your first tokens in the system. </li></ul><br>  The code for the entire project is completely open and available on <a href="https://github.com/robotveradev/VeraWebApp">Github</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/420961/">https://habr.com/ru/post/420961/</a></p>
