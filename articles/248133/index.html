For today we answered all inquiries from students till January 15th inclusive.  Today we work with those who sent their results and essays today, January 16th.  So, if you did not receive an answer, and sent your data yesterday or earlier - do not hesitate to remind yourself. </li><li>  We decided that in this set we will connect to the working Skype chat rooms of our students after the Program has been launched and the first substantive, rather than organizational, questions have gone.  We will not create each other unnecessary hype in the information space, especially since the students in this program are a record number and we will create new sources of communication between you more carefully. </li><li>  The forum, quite possibly, will be replaced by a closed group on Facebook.  The FB now made quite convenient means for answering and discussing; besides, there is a client for the FB in almost every smartphone, which makes it easier for many students to participate in the discussion of issues.  We will also launch this thing later. </li></ol>

      If you have not been authorized in skype by our curators or have not added you to the forum, do not worry, nobody has left our tenacious hands: after 5 years of work, we have not lost or forgot a single student :) <br><br>  ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. <br><br>  <b>New in the world of entertainment on other people's nerves</b> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Troling and online entertainment are becoming more perverse.  And this is not about sweepstakes or stolen photos of celebrities.  More and more painful.  Several people have already honestly said that they even drank drugs.  Because the nerves are not iron. <br><br>  Let's take it in order. <br><br>  Friends knocked on my door and they plan to slowly move to live and work in Kiev.  Corresponding  housing issue.  We decided to sell our housing while we live in a rented apartment and buy a slightly larger apartment in a newly built house, taking into account the planned expansion of the family.  The question was that I, as a person living in Kiev, suggested something about traffic intersections, better areas for living, and generally said that I was thinking about this way of buying a home. <br><br>  To speak at least something substantive, I rummaged a little in the construction market, looked at the houses under construction in the metro reach area and turned out to be on a good, very systematic forum where developers, construction sites, future neighbors are discussed, in a word - what I needed , in order to understand how the construction works of several houses, which were intended by my friends, are going. <br><br>  Construction of real estate, and even more so construction in the capital of the state, which is now involved in serious political and economic battles, is a very, very difficult thing.  Ratings of developers, recommendations of "experts", risk factors.  In general, a whole day of winter holidays, I spent in the expanding world of investing in apartments under construction.  Even tightened. <br><br>  The thing I would like to share, which I can‚Äôt name except ‚Äúhell trolling‚Äù, was found by me almost immediately. <br><br>  Going into a new forum or community, I first look at the most frequently asked questions, then I look at the list of the most active users, I understand who is here for a long time, and who writes messages on behalf of the administration.  I was attracted by the ‚Äúhot tops‚Äù and the scandals raging there. <br><br>  In several hot topics, simultaneously on different construction sites, from newly created accounts, two types of messages were thrown: <br><br><ol><li>  The director of the developer / owner of the building holding FIO (hereinafter went full name, patronymic, year of birth, in places slipped more detailed data) fled abroad or was taken under arrest.  The property of the company has been arrested.  Construction is frozen. </li><li>  The construction commission has withdrawn the building permit.  Scans of some title documents on which it is noted that some numbers in the ‚Äúdecoding‚Äù mean not a building permit at all, but only a temporary use of a piece of land, which allegedly means that the construction company does not plan to finish the construction and therefore does not bought land from the city, etc. </li></ol><br><br>  Next come a long line of photographs / scans of some documents, on which we will notice!  - the correct addresses and surnames related to a specific construction site or house flash, and then calls to go urgently to the site and almost ‚Äústorm‚Äù the sales department or go to the bank and demand to terminate the investment agreement, loan or something else. <br><br>  After a throw-in, there is often an instant wave of screams from frightened investors: asking for those ‚Äúwho live closer there‚Äù, to come to the construction site, to see how things are going.  Someone breaks away from work, one person wrote that leaving the nerves from the parking lot hit the car.  In the comments they wrote that people really broke down and went to another area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city, where they met the same people who were alarmed by the Internet to alert people who were scaredly watched by girls from a completely normal sales department. <br><br>  Also in the comments, it is noticed that after the first wave of shouts, photos of the closed doors of sales departments and empty construction sites appear already from other accounts, which later, as it turns out, belong either to weekends or to the previous stage of construction in general.  Some of these photos are today's dates (!).  That is, the trolls either work together or it‚Äôs one troll having several accounts, don‚Äôt be lazy to waste time on elementary actions with Photoshop to finish drawing dates on a photo (remember how cameras used to put such a tag on a photo? Now digicams don‚Äôt , who remembers it?) <br><br>  <b>What does a troll or a troll team do?</b> <br><br>  Selects a developer.  Chooses a construction site of a new / young developer or a forum in which there are some critical comments on the construction process, that is, where the emotional background of the participants has already somehow warmed up.  Often, by the way, this is a fairly low-cost construction project and an ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù class house, because there is practically no such discussion in the forums of more expensive real estate: the developer goes according to plan, the sales department answers questions from investors promptly and no one has any desire for public discussions. Something problematic.  Next, the troll or team examines information from the site developer.  Collects information that will make his ‚Äústuffing‚Äù more believable.  Sometimes, if I understood correctly, even from web archives (way back maschine?) Picks up old photos, scans of state registry sites or construction sites, which contain outdated information, but having a direct relationship (addresses, plans, phone numbers) to that construction site, about which there is a stuffing. <br><br>  Then there is a stuffing and a lot of nerves are instantly burned by dozens and hundreds of investors who are subscribed to this forum (and in some forums, 300-400 people are signed).  In the evening, refutations begin either from the developer or from the forum administration, with which the developers themselves communicate in order to reassure people.  Sometimes accounts from which there was a stuffing overwritten along with the stuffing themselves.  Sometimes they are then cleaned by administrators.  But just try to imagine for a moment kilograms of adrenaline and a few kilometers of nerves that are burned at the moment when people who have invested in construction see such stuffing and for a split second they believe that the money they have invested has just burned. <br><br>  <b>And let them invest as normal!</b> <br><br>  Yes, some investment / investment guarantee funds exist and are working.  But they cooperate with them, as I was able to understand from a superficial study of the issue (so that I could be very wrong), not every developer.  In addition, in countries where the currency depreciates 1.5-2 times in a few months, it‚Äôs not too much to get the amount invested in rubles or hryvnas from the fund a year ago, you will agree. <br><br>  Yes, you need to choose how and where to invest and read-check-consult.  With this, no one argues.  I repeated it all three times to my acquaintances, on the question of whom I climbed into this wonderful world of wonderful and terrible entertainment on other people's nerves.  My acquaintances, by the way, decided to take an apartment in an unfinished house, pushing some other plans. <br><br>  But how come up and worked out, you tell me ?!  With the preparation of ‚Äúfacts‚Äù, with photoshop of ‚Äúdocuments‚Äù, with the collection of real names and surnames, so that investors ‚Äúrecognize‚Äù their familiar names.  With arrangement on time and heating from several accounts.  The operation is complete. <br><br>  Yes, it is quite possible that these are ‚Äúwars of competitors‚Äù.  Or just some representative office plankton with a computer and the Internet a lot of time.  Or to those who are trying to solve the complex issue of housing.  But all this in one way or another relates to information wars and informational influence, about which we wrote a lot before the new year. <br><br>  Allow yourself to repeat. <br><br>  <b>Information warfare methods work.</b>  And the more unstable your model of the world is now, the more we put unchecked, and often frankly false information into the brain, the more nerves we spend on things outside our control (exchange rates, world crises, galloping indices, politics) - it is easier to catch us in such traps.  The more time our brain spends on something useful for you and the more the brain is loaded with ‚Äúthe right raw material for processing‚Äù - that is, the information that makes you smarter and more functional - the more likely you will pass the time of change and information wars without loss of nerves, money and time. <br><br>  We set ourselves goals.  And we give these goals to pull themselves up to be in a calm state, above the situation and always, at any moment in time, to know that you are right now doing something that nobody will take away from you tomorrow: invest in yourself, in your head, in your skills to live and work better. <br><br>  <b>OK, Google: What to do?</b>  <b>:)</b> <br><br>  Before the new year, we were able to pull 450 people into the zone of informational stability and connect to the long-term training program.  This year, we will continue to launch both intensive monthly training programs and to additionally recruit students for the long-term program of the Stratoplan School of Managers. <br><br>  In the next issue of the ‚Äúinformation sheet‚Äù, we will tell you about the upcoming event that we are preparing next week: I want to charge each other for the whole business season until the summer and we seem to have figured out how to do it and it‚Äôs interesting and useful. <br><br>  Do not switch.  Before communication. <br>  Good luck to us all. <br><br>  - <br>  <b>Respectfully,</b> <br>  Slava Pankratov <br>  Managing Partner of the Stratoplan School of Managers <br>  Troling analyst :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/248133/">https://habr.com/ru/post/248133/</a></p>
