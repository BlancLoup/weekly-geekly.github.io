According to Michal Chupa, director of the Group in the Russian division of the corporation, in three years <a href="http://msn.ru/">MSN.ru</a> portal and other key Microsoft Internet products will bring him a <strong>place in the top three leaders of the domestic online market</strong> and become the fourth most profitable network division of the corporation in Europe.  Intriguing, is not it? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Even more intriguing is the words of Mr. Chupa about the ways of advancing to the top of the Internet Olympus, which he sees for himself.  On the question of how Microsoft is going to take one of the ‚Äúthree runet buttons,‚Äù Michal dropped a remark that one of the market leading companies could ‚Äúchange ownership‚Äù, while others might not live to see the Internet triumph, centralized in the services of Live.  Such plans are quite suitable strategic title, so it is appropriate to recall the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/microsoft/27953.html">promise of</a> Steve Ballmer great to spend on acquisitions over five years.  Assumptions about who in runet cost to free up space under the mattress for millions of Redmond, are accepted in the comments.  We put on sites whose audience has recently grown very appetizing and has not yet been monetized in any way (is the hint quite subtle?). <br><br>  In the near future, all services will get a strong push, pulling up behind the flagship, which has been assigned the world's most popular messenger with the simple name Messenger.  The press release says that it will be positioned as ‚Äúthe best service for video calls and the exchange of photos and files of any size,‚Äù forcing more and more users to receive their Windows Live ID, by which all other ‚Äúgoodies‚Äù will be available to them.  MSN Video and Soapbox - video portals that work respectively with licensed and amateur content purchased, will be the first among them.  Their localized versions will be launched by the 15th anniversary of the work of MS in our market, already in December of this year, together with a large-scale update of the entire MSN.ru. <br><br>  Great emphasis will be placed on mobile applications.  According to the forecast of the corporation, in 3 years the number of mobile phones will exceed the number of computers by 3.5 times, so this channel of attracting users to online services promises to be very profitable.  Today, friendship with Live is already fully integrated into Windows Mobile 6, and soon, thanks to the support of Nokia, it will be easily available to Symbian users.

      One of the main priorities in the development of the next version of the Live Search search at Microsoft was the introduction of improved support for the Russian language.  Its implementation is promised to be completed by next spring.  This corporation is recognized as one of the most important conditions for the conquest of the Russian market.  In the future, video search will be launched, as well as mobile search. <br><br>  Other key ‚ÄúRussified‚Äù services are Hotmail, Spaces blog platform and <a href="http://get.live.com/wl/all">specialized utilities</a> : Photo Album, Calendar, Events, Writer and Mail. <br>  Of course, the attention of users will also be attracted through partnerships of the corporation with domestic companies.  Marketing will be supported by ‚Äúrelevant investments,‚Äù and this phrase alone, performed by people from Microsoft, should evoke future competitors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15890/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15890/</a></p>
