Until recently, I did not come across this either, but today's case seemed to me to be not quite an ordinary thing.  If you're wondering how youtube can block a completely normal video, I ask for cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Last week, the days of the city were held in our glorious city of Daugavpils - a holiday traveling from one district to another, usually culminating in several shows on the main square of the city.  There was such an event on Sunday, called "The show of fire and water."  In general, by world standards, nothing new and special, but our inexperienced people rejoiced and looked with pleasure.  ‚ÄúWhy not write a small post while the memories are fresh‚Äù - I thought, and <a href="http://www.tautastiesa.lv/ru/blog/Nikita-Pipchenko/ognennoe-i-vodnoe-shou-na-ploschadi-vienibas-13/">sketched a</a> few lines, and also mounted a couple of commercials glued together from a pair of separately shot videos.  These illustrations for the post of course, out of habit, uploaded to YouTube and continued to do their own thing.  However, having entered the Video Manager once again, I saw a not entirely pleasant picture - it was the last two videos that had the Content ID claim:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efb/62a/42d/efb62a42d705ded6aba1275bee5d1f1a.jpg"><br><br>  It turned out that the googling robot found in my videos as many as three compositions, horror of, infringing copyrights!  In the first video, the track Muse - The 2nd Law was discovered: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pm87k3r2yaM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjTqRwFDsuxoroOdgBg_-ng5Fo6CQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the second video, the copyright shark spotted the value in Black Or White of Michael Jackson and Time To Say Goodbye Andrea Bochelia and Sarah Brightman: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9-3denYPcko%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjrddTKwy1YxgPy0jAUb4EtSmap6w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Perhaps, I would completely agree with these claims in the event that I personally superimposed these compositions on the video sequence in the editor, but the videos were made on the central square of the city, where thousands of people were present!  And you can make a logical assumption that the show organizers had the right to publicly reproduce this content, because this is still a citywide celebration, and our local agency for the protection of authors' rights also does not sleep. <br><br>  After weighing all the arguments "for" and "against", I decided to challenge the claims and opened "cases" for both videos, where I explained the essence - the video was filmed in the central square of the city during a public show, the composition did not overlap with the video series, respectively I own the video. <br><br>  As the attentive reader managed to notice, the answer to the second video did not have to wait long - the right holder quickly considered the issue and rejected the protest, now the video is blocked in some countries.  Apparently, such a decision should be expected in the second case ... <br><br>  Interestingly, in similar situations, the work of <a href="http://youtu.be/X2Cv-POLSWk">Rammstein</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/ygUYrVEAtO0">‚ÄúPesnyarov‚Äù</a> did not interest the rights holders at all, apparently in the present case the sound quality turned out to be too good, or the labels have become particularly greedy. <br><br>  As a conclusion on the current situation, we can safely summarize the following - even such large companies as Google are under the <s>thumb of</s> copyright copyright labels and collaborators, since they completely thoughtlessly provide them with serious tools for deleting video recordings that can only remotely relate to that very copyright .  Such a situation can make life quite difficult for people using the YouTube platform as the main one when doing business, because at almost any moment you can get a notification that one or several of tens / hundreds / thousands of videos you download violate someone‚Äôs rights. and as a result, your account with its entire reputation and subscribers may suddenly be blocked.  So consider this possibility and try not to keep recordings on YouTube that are not duplicated anywhere else and cannot be restored in case of force majeure. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225769/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225769/</a></p>
