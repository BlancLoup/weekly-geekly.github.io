The company accuses Rutor.org of illegally distributing on the Internet the films Love and Pigeons, Moscow Doesn‚Äôt Believe in Tears, Ivan Vasilyevich Changes the Profession and the Caucasian Captive </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f08/bd6/059/f08bd605933c14f3585a3d30fd472ad2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  For me the choice of these films is completely incomprehensible, to be honest.  Especially considering the fact that at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mosfilm/videos">office.</a>  Mosfilm <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mosfilm/videos">channel</a> on youtube all these films seem to be laid out. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Why did I write ‚Äúsort of like‚Äù?  The reason is simple: instead of watching a movie on YouTube, you can admire a recurring commercial for one and a half hours.  And the message of such content: <br><blockquote>  The full version of the film is available free of charge at the Mosfilm online cinema - <a href="http://cinema.mosfilm.ru/">cinema.mosfilm.ru</a> ... <br><br>  The film is also available in HD quality (high resolution): <br>  iTunes coming soon <br>  Google Movies - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/movies/">play.google.com/store/movies</a> ...

      And in mobile applications: <br>  AppStore - <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/">itunes.apple.com/ru/app</a> ... <br>  Google Apps - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/">play.google.com/store</a> ... </blockquote><br>  So the news about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/google/blog/118244/">More than 200 pictures of the Mosfilm Cinema Concern on YouTube is</a> already somewhat untrue. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/13e/325/b3e13e3252d8f0af7303db9ec08d009a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  By the way, the people actively complained in discussing this very news about the unprecedented generosity of Mosfilm: the second part of the picture was not there, or the English subtitles were not turned off.  In general, everything is not their tick.  Since 2011, the number of films has not increased.  The mosfilm channel in the video section currently features 324 videos.  But almost half of them are movie songs.  In the ‚ÄúHD quality‚Äù only 5 pictures!  The rest is 480r.  Some of the pictures can still be viewed only with English subtitles, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DlVpmZnRIMKs">Irony of Fate, or Enjoy Your Bath</a> .  In short, this is trash and waste, and not the promised access to full-length pictures in high quality ... <br><br>  The most ridiculous I watched on the page of the very "branded" online cinema, where Mosfilm invites usernames - instead of these your trackers: <br><blockquote>  Rights holders are often blamed for the fact that we do not allow users to watch movies on the web legally.  This is not true.  We have our own online cinema at cinema.mosfilm.ru, where you can watch movies for free </blockquote><br>  Such a picture was pleasing to the eye and amused the heart just 3 minutes ago when I tried to watch the film ‚ÄúThe Caucasian Captive, or the New Adventures of Shurik‚Äù on cinema.mosfilm.ru, because of which (among others) ‚ÄúMosfilm‚Äù decided to sue with Rutor: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07c/963/8ea/07c9638ea102fbd445a1c67b52b30fec.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In fairness, it should be noted that by clicking on the link ‚ÄúWatching on YouTube‚Äù, the film can actually be watched. <br><hr><br>  I would like to write more about this online cinema. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19e/0e8/a6f/19e0e8a6f21e743a054cb012eb86b994.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the website of the cinema from "Mosfilm" you can really watch movies online (video is picked up from the Tytube).  I don‚Äôt know why the website liked my chanterelle so much that he said that Mosfilm had blocked the movie in his online cinema.  Fortunately, in another browser, the video is still playing.  But we understand that the picture loses quality in online viewing, it can slow down, and so on, so that the viewer risks experiencing not the emotions that the creators of the picture hoped for.  Therefore, I tried to download the Caucasian Captive.  Since I don‚Äôt use either <i>Google Play</i> or the <i>AppStore</i> , I just decided to click on the ‚Äúdownload‚Äù button. <br>  But it turned out that just download, as on the rutor, does not work: you must first register.  None other than to accept the ridiculous <a href="http://cinema.mosfilm.ru/project/rules.php">"terms of use of the site</a> . <a href="http://cinema.mosfilm.ru/project/rules.php">"</a>  There the inquisitive username is at risk of reading the following, for example (sorry for the caps, so in the original). <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">terms of use (excerpts)</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>Hid from sin under a spoiler, since Mosfilm Cinema Concern requires you &lt;...&gt; not to publish via the Forums &lt;...&gt; any content or perform any actions (s): &lt;...&gt; copy any other pages, text or images on this Site without proper permission "</i> <br><blockquote>  &lt;...&gt; <br>  IN THE CASE IF MOSFILM CINEMA CONTAINS ANY COST, DAMAGE OR ANY OTHER COSTS AS A RESULT OF YOUR CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, <b>YOU MUST CONTRACT</b> YOUR CONDITIONS OF THE TERMS <b>AND</b> CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, <b>YOU MUST CONTRACT</b> YOUR CONDITIONS <br>  &lt;...&gt; <br>  In any case, <b>any materials you send to our address will not be considered confidential</b> . <br><br>  Please use this site responsibly.

Just great! <br>  In addition, it turned out that it would be more correct to call this button ‚Äúbuy‚Äù, since they require to pay 200 rubles for downloading. <br><br>  On the <a href="http://cinema.mosfilm.ru/faq/">FAQ</a> page of Mosfilm's online cinema, we are waiting for another disappointment: <br><blockquote>  Movies are available for download in MP4 container.  The video is encoded with a high-performance H.264 codec with a bit rate of at least 1800 kbps, the sound is encoded with an AAC-LC codec with a bit rate of 160 kbps. </blockquote>  That is, films are presented in only one format.  And for some reason in MP4.  Where is the megapopular matryoshka?  Where familiar to many. Avi?  At least for decency planned the emergence of "more other" formats in the future ... <b>And most importantly!</b>  Why is being sued because of the distribution of films in any format?  Then would cover only those distributions, in which there were these films in MP4 format.  In my opinion, fair. <br><br>  A separate topic is the very ‚ÄúHD quality‚Äù, for which many would probably not at all feel sorry to pay both 200 and 500 rubles.  It turned out that everything is also sad: of the 57 films in the section ‚Äúfilms with subtitles‚Äù, for example, in ‚ÄúHD quality‚Äù only 8 are presented. So, for what then do they need money? <br><br>  In short, this is a complete lack of choice and disappointment.  Personally, this reminds me most of all Kunshtyuk with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/165635/">re-releases of albums with scanty copies</a> to extend the terms of copyright protection.  Only in our case, the so-called right holders can now cynically poke their nose at cinema.mosfilm.ru - in response to questions about what alternatives do users of torrent trackers who want to watch good old movies have. <br><br>  In general, this ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù cinema seemed to me senseless and <s>merciless</s> uncomfortable.  Senseless, because I personally do not see the point in online viewing from tybuba (why then this fuss, if you can just upload pictures on youtube?).  Inconvenient because: <br>  1) search there lousy; <br>  2) information about the films of figs and nefig (in the film search many times more and more interesting); <br>  3) categories for a tick: if you limit the movie to a single genre, you get something very strange (which, in fact, can be seen on cinema.mosfilm.ru): ‚ÄúKill the dragon‚Äù they have fantasy, and ‚ÄúStalker‚Äù - drama; <br>  4) some ridiculous selections, such as "Films for the New Year" or "For the Day of Defender of the Fatherland"; <br>  5) in ‚ÄúHD quality‚Äù there are few pictures; <br>  6) to buy an electronic copy of the film, you must carefully study the Russian legislation, because when you buy you agree with vague "terms of use of the site." <br><br><hr><br><br>  But this is the little things.  The most terrible thing for me in this story is the choice of films because of which Mosfilm decided to bring a lawsuit against a torrent tracker.  This is really the masterpieces of the Soviet film classics!  Why so cruel ?!  Especially against the background of ostentatious care of the audience with laying out (such as) these same films for free (such as) viewing. <br>  I just want to write them very loud, bright red with something: guys, do not deprive the people of their wealth!  I am already silent about the fact that these films were shot with taxpayers' money.  God is with them, with money.  Although I would pay extra on the site of the Ministry of Culture to every teenager who watches this ‚Äúsad old stuff‚Äù (I'm afraid the VKontakte generation perceives this way the popularly adored films of the last century).  But this is a <b>cultural heritage</b> .  <i>Not a legacy</i> , but a <i>legacy</i> .  <i>Cultural</i> , damn it! <br><br>  All the films because of which Mosfilm decided to file a lawsuit are <b>no longer</b> on the tracker.  Congratulations, gentlemen holders.  You won.  The only question is who exactly and who will suffer in the course of your victorious war. <br><br>  Modern Russian film business was not enough to flood rental with lousy remakes, such as <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B,_%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8!">Gentlemen, good luck!</a>  and the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA_%25D1%2581_%25D0%25B1%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0_%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA">Man from the Capuchin Boulevard</a> , you have to press the last of the long-suffering film classics. <br><br>  In "Mosfilm" triumph - their first appeal to the court in connection with the "anti-piracy" law was satisfied.  Now in the cinema concern busy preparing a lawsuit.  <b>That would be no good films to do!</b> <br><br>  <i><b>PS</b></i> <br><blockquote>  - What kind of mother? <br>  - Parisian.  God ... mother. </blockquote>  At the cost of inhuman effort limited himself to this quote.  Let them read between the lines, Herods. <br><hr><br>  To finish off those who mastered this bed sheet (I honestly diluted it with pictures, following the requirements of the people), I offer a survey: </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205256/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205256/</a></p>
