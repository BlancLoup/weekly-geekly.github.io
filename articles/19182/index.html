  <section class="page js-page"><h1>From the madness of the crowd to the wisdom of the collective mind</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <em>This my note is at the junction of two topics started earlier: about the <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D65574">revolution of social platforms</a> (this will be the fourth note of this cycle) and what does <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D70552">not suit</a> me <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D70552">in the top4top concept</a> (it was only about the concept).</em> <br><br>  <strong>Tastes differ</strong> <br>  Honestly, putting a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/pure_content/33898.html">shortened version of</a> my first note on top4top in Habrahabr, I was expecting a violent reaction like "Well, these intellectuals, they always have something wrong."  With two different sub-options.  First, who needs these intelligent social resources?  The second - and what is top4top not intelligent? <br><br>  Everything turned out to be much more prosaic.  In the first version, although ‚Äúblack balls‚Äù fell down, there were significantly fewer of them than they were six months ago when my first notes appeared in the collective blog ‚ÄúIntelligent Social Web‚Äù.

      According to the second variant, unexpectedly, practically, everyone agreed with me: the new resource is very far from the intellectual title.  This is the usual "glossy portal."  Therefore, the topic of top4top, as such, I think you can close and go to some of the thoughts arising from its discussion about ... <br><br>  However, before paraphrasing the poet, I once again want to repeat: ‚ÄúIf sites are lit, it means someone needs it,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSites are different, sites are different.‚Äù  There is no doubt that they will find their admirers both top4top and bigthink - its unique prototype, which I also spoke about in the previous article.  We need both glossy and ‚Äúyellow‚Äù resources, and resources about high matters.  There would be only advertisers :).  I'm still looking for something else ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Little by little about a lot about a little?</strong> <br>  In the <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D70552">previous article</a> it was noted that, choosing between top4top and bigthink, I would stop at the last one.  At the same time, he noticed that he only satisfies me by ¬æ.  Where did the remaining quarter go?  I will try to explain. <br><br>  Firstly, this missing quarter includes some rather important ‚Äútrifles‚Äù that I look for on the social Internet and which I tried to put into the technical task of <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D59375">our project</a> .  Although many of the basic requirements listed in the staged note ‚Äú <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D16344">My Space, which I can‚Äôt ...</a> ‚Äù in bigthink, fortunately, have been realized.  However, this is not the main thing. <br><br>  Purely for provocative (or, as they say now, for ‚Äúprovocative‚Äù) goals, what I wanted to see was called by me ‚Äúintelligent web‚Äù.  Thanks to top4top and Dibrov with Novozhilov, personally.  With their easy hand, it has finally become clear to everyone that the prefix "intelligent" and "intellectual" does not lower the commodity value of a start-up project.  And users of the social web don't necessarily have to be teenagers and young people.  Now it's time for me to clarify.  But this will require the definition of my vision of another concept.  To the two already defined in the previous article ( <em>intellectuality</em> and <em>intelligence</em> ) I want to add a third - professionalism.  And do it the same way. <br><br>  I define <em>professionalism</em> as a state of mind, which can be assessed through the same IQ, in sum with special knowledge (not necessarily associated with higher education) and experience.  The higher IQ, deeper knowledge and more experience, the higher the professionalism.  All these indicators are roughly equivalent. <br><br>  Thus, as I understand it, if an intellectual is a person with extensive general knowledge, then a professional relies primarily on deep specialized knowledge.  In other words, an intellectual knows <em>little about much</em> , and a professional knows a <em>lot about a little</em> .  In this case, a professional may be an intellectual and / or intellectual, and may not be one or the other. <br><br>  When I first <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D18157">started talking</a> about the intelligent web, I immediately stressed that <em>real professionals</em> really need it.  Thus, it was clearly meant that only intellectuals can be real professionals.  Implicitly, it was meant that true professionals are intellectuals too.  In other words, <strong>I refer to the real professionals of people who combine in themselves broad general and narrow special knowledge and possess inner culture</strong> .  It is possible to agree or disagree with such an approach, but this is my position, and I began to look for a resource for this position. <br><br>  <strong>And again ... 80:20</strong> <br>  No words, bigthink is a social resource for intellectuals.  But, it seems to me that true professionals and, in particular, techies do not have much time to give away to ‚Äúhigh matters‚Äù and the satisfaction of their common interests.  But it is precisely that bigthink is aimed at. <br><br>  I would like to see a single social resource in which, in accordance with the well-known principle of ‚Äú80:20‚Äù, I could spend 80% of the time, satisfying my narrow professional interests (20% of all resource possibilities).  The remaining 20% ‚Äã‚Äãof the time is devoted to its overall development (80% of the resource capacity). <br><br>  Well, you ask, why two different intelligent resources are not suitable for this: common bigthink types and some special ones?  Of course, they will do, and maybe this will have to stop in the end.  However, you see, it would be much more interesting in one circle of virtual friends to discuss special questions and talk ‚Äúfor life‚Äù.  So we do in the real world.  After all, each of us has not so much time for communication, as well as real friends, generally speaking, too ... <br><br>  And now I will explain what kind of narrow professional interests I am talking about when I speak about the main time that real professionals spend on the social Internet. <br><br>  <strong>Information above all</strong> <br>  In one of my <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D48692">notes,</a> I have already noted the main difference between the needs of users of the traditional social web and professional business.  In the first, these needs, according to their priority, can be arranged as follows: communication, self-expression, information, cooperation  For professionals and business people, it seems to me, the sequence of priorities is completely different, namely, information, cooperation, communication, and self-expression. <br><br>  Based on this approach, it can be said that the comprehensive support of user information activities is one of the most important tasks of a social resource for professionals.  Services aimed at finding, analyzing, streamlining and storing the information he needs, I think this is what the specialist, first of all, expects from a professional resource.  For me, in any case, such services are fundamental. <br><br>  If we are talking about social resources, then we expect from them also the full support of collective information activities.  <strong>Support that allows in the full sense of the word to transform a social resource into a powerful collective mind.</strong>  Such a collective mind not only provides a narrow-purpose search and selection of third-party information, but also generates new information.  Whether great articles, full-fledged blog notes, small comments, or just a replica of a specialist, everything can help a professional in solving some specific task facing him, unexpectedly suggest ways to solve it or throw up completely new ideas. <br><br>  <strong>Open Sesame!</strong>  <strong>Or Normal heroes always go around</strong> <br>  I have already <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D648">mentioned</a> this once well-known phrase of one fairy-tale hero Rolan Bykov.  A hero who advised everyone and always to go around.  Then I talked about Russian outsourcing.  A similar strategy for finding workarounds is very well applied to Internet startups in the era of <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D65574">open social networks</a> . <br><br>  <em>About this strategy and how it influenced the ‚Äúproject of our project‚Äù in terms of creating an <strong>information-oriented resource for professionals</strong> can be found in the full version of this <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D72401">post</a> on my <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D72401">iTech Bridge blog</a> .</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19182/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19182/</a></p>
