  <section class="page js-page"><h1>WayForPay: orders without a basket, how to simplify the process of buying a client?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the era of active development of e-commerce, with new technologies that simplify online shopping for the buyer, there are quite a few sites that do not even have a basket of sales.  Registration of goods or services takes place by telephone or by e-mail.  In addition, even large Internet merchants tend to take orders through a call center, or by e-mail. <br>  The average order of "without a basket" orders can reach 40%, even with a full-fledged site.  Depending on the type of business, the share of ‚Äúphone purchases‚Äù can be up to 80% of orders. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/395/6ba/b3a/3956bab3af3b466b8533c6c16eb8fa4c.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If the payment partner handles the acceptance of payments on the site through the basket, then when accepting payment by phone, there are mainly several options considered.

      <b>Card details or account</b> <br><br>  The standard scheme of work for many small online stores.  An order is formed, and payment is requested to make on the card or send an invoice with the details for payment.  If the online store accepts 1-2 orders per day, then to issue such a payment and track the payment is not difficult.  But when working with dozens and hundreds of orders per day - the sales department will be busy only with reconciliations (whether the money was credited to the account, when and whether the full payment amount). <br><br>  <b>C.O.D</b> <br><br>  Cash on delivery is convenient for the buyer, but not always positive for the seller.  Especially when the buyer does not take the goods at the post office or from the courier. <br>  In addition, if this is a service / product requiring prepayment, it is more acceptable to use an electronic account. <br><br>  <b>Invoice</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúInvoice‚Äù (from eng. Invoice) is an electronic invoice, which is formed by the seller online and sent to the client by e-mail, by sms or by other convenient method for making payment online.  The client only needs to enter his billing information to make payment for the product or service.  In fact, it is a formed basket with the goods in the client's electronic box that must be paid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ff/62d/1ed/7ff62d1ed74b4962bf2709e4ea73b290.png"><br><br>  The e-invoice can be formed by the call center operator, while adding additional items (for example, related products) that were sold to the buyer during the dialogue.  ‚ÄúInvoice‚Äù is convenient for offline businesses where full or partial prepayment is required - for example, for small hotels when booking, for travel agencies when paying for a tour, visas, and for any business where ‚Äúremote‚Äù simple calculations are needed.  Also, electronic billing can be suitable for online merchants, who may change the value of goods, for example, retail and wholesale prices. <br>  In the WayForPay Invoice system, you can create it in your personal account, specifying the cost of the product, the quantity and the buyer‚Äôs email / phone, or integrate the service to the online store via the API.  The invoice can be sent via the WayForPay system, or from an online store.  In addition, an electronic account can be sent to the client's phone number as an sms message with a link to the invoice.  The buyer, upon receipt of the invoice can easily make payment online, which will speed up the receipt of money by the seller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a7/4e4/4f8/1a74e44f8a7745fa9e61c2e93cea2132.png"><br><br>  The online store can accept payment online on the site through the basket, take orders through the call center, and track payment and general statistics of payments in the merchant's personal account. <br><br>  Using e-invoices saves time for both the buyer and the seller.  But the greater advantage of the "invoice" is that the already formed "basket", which the client has to pay online. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293362/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293362/</a></p>
