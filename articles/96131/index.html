  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We answer: how to organize an event</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This article is an extended response to the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/miting/96105/">"How to organize an event</a> . <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/miting/96105/">"</a>  It was written based on the personal experience of organizing User Group meetings in his hometown. <br><br>  The very first problem faced by event organizers is the lack of a budget or the presence of a small part of it (otherwise, organizing an event is more like spending money).  We will proceed from this situation. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Location </h4><br>  The cheapest way to hold events at the initial stage is to hold a university. 
      <br>

      <br>
      Pros: <ul><li>  very cheap or free </li><li>  the presence of a large number of audiences / halls </li><li>  As a rule, there is a projector, if carried out in one of the conference rooms </li><li>  a large number of students </li></ul>  Minuses: <ul><li>  as a rule, the status of events that are held in universities is low </li><li>  there may be problems with permits, bureaucracy in obtaining permission for the event </li><li>  we need additional people for hanging posters, drawing arrows on the buildings, etc. </li></ul>  These problems can be solved if there are familiar teachers at the university (and, as a rule, they exist).  But with the bureaucracy no one has yet been able to cope. <br><br>  The next option is to negotiate with IT companies.  How to convince them - let's talk a little lower. <br><br><h4>  If there is no projector, but you need it - do not buy it? </h4><br>  Immediately buy a projector is difficult, so you need to look for a venue with a projector, or rent it. <br><br>  I now choose a projector for a group, the average price of a projector is about $ 500. <br><br><h4>  Search speakers </h4><br>  Be prepared that at the first two or three events you and (or) your friends / good acquaintances will be the speakers.  Hope that from the first meetings to you lined up specialist gurus do not have to. <br><br>  Do I have to pay speakers?  If you have a budget, why not?  But we come out of the situation that our budget is small.  We solved this problem in our own way - we give our speakers interesting books, original e-books, backpacks (see sponsorship). This is better than nothing and leaves a pleasant impression on everyone. <br><br>  Search for speakers is always necessary - you can place ads on the site, use all known social networks and resources, but, as a rule, they are in person.  Therefore it is necessary to take part in various events where you can find interested people.  It is best to make a report at another event and to tell about your ideas about the quality of a small lyrical digression. <br><br>  How can the speakers be interested: <ul><li>  explain that participation in the event is a good self-promotion, the level of which is very strongly correlated with the level of salary; </li><li>  the opportunity to hone speech at local events for possible participation in more reputable conferences in the future; </li><li>  financially; </li><li>  to offer some kind of buns in the form of discounts on books, software, invitations to habr, etc.  (here everything that is at hand goes into business or what was agreed upon). </li></ul><h4>  Sponsor Search </h4><br>  This is a long and difficult question.  You must convince the company that it will be beneficial to part with the n-th sum of money. <br><br>  A few rules: <ul><li>  no need to say how well done you are and what a great idea you have of holding an event, but it is necessary to dwell on the benefits that a company can receive from participating in the initiative.  All companies are interested in recruitment, so we can say that the event will have a certain amount of targeted audience.  Then you can tell that participation can help the company create an image of a loyal company and a company that works for the future. </li><li>  You can offer a company representative to tell about yourself 5-10 minutes, distribute booklets or other information </li><li>  if you have your own website - offer to make an advertising newsletter on your base, place a banner or logo on the site; </li></ul>  In addition to monetary sponsors, there may be informational ones - these are bloggers, online publications, etc., who can write about your initiative and place links to you.  It will not bring you money, but it will help you in the future. <br><br>  It must be remembered that companies can also hold such seminars, so you can agree on a joint meeting. <br><br>  Worse, when companies (or other similar groups in your city) are trying to pull the blanket over themselves, which leads to a situation where the participants in the events start to get confused, which leads to a decrease in interest from both parties.  Ideally, all structures should interact with each other and help each other. <br><br><h4>  Problems like without them? </h4><br>  You need to understand that there will be a lot of problems. <br><br>  Here are some of them: <ul><li>  if you hold events in the context of Microsoft, there will always be people who will come and say "MS - ha * but", the organizer - "adept", "zombies", and someone will surely write that you sold out to "evil corporations" etc.  This is relevant for all types of events, regardless of the topic, salary level, status and work experience; </li><li>  you will surely come across <a href="http://msug.vn.ua/blogs/akrakovetsky/archive/2010/05/05/thoughts-about-user-groups-passive.aspx">low activity and low attendance at your events</a> ; </li><li>  anyway, someone will not be pleased with your work; </li><li>  You should have plenty of free time. </li></ul>  Useful links: <ul><li>  <a href="http://msug.vn.ua/wikis/working/377.aspx">Checklist of the organizer of the lecture, master class, seminar</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/thecroaker/death-by-powerpoint-rus">How to make presentations</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://msug.vn.ua/wikis/ithumor/156.aspx">Murphy's Laws for Events and Meetings</a> </li></ul><h4>  Recommend </h4><br><img src="http://www.mannpublishing.com/ImagesCatalog/1932577327_Medium.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I recommend reading the book <a href="http://www.mannpublishing.com/Catalog/BookDetail.aspx%3FBookID%3D64">‚ÄúThe Rational Guide to Building Technical User Communities‚Äù by Rational Press</a> .  The author, Greg Low, has the status of MVP and Microsoft Regional Director, is the organizer of several technical communities, as well as a speaker with experience.  This book should be useful for those who want to organize meetings. <br><br>  If you forgot something, you can kick in the comments.
