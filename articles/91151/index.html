  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Paid habrabra and free movies: an entertaining study of the problem of copyright</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday, a long, well-reasoned article about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/copyright/91123/">economic essence of an intangible product</a> appeared at Habr√©, the essence of which was that at the moment when the first free copy of an object appears, the value of its ‚Äúlicensed‚Äù copies is equal to zero, the earnings of the creators are ‚ÄúRussian Roulette ", and business becomes at least somewhat impossible.  At the same time, the mention of the fact that all types of protection (for example, DRM / StarForse in games or film companies' lawsuits with torrent trackers) are just an attempt to postpone the inevitable free distribution point ‚Äî when the content finally hits the network for free ‚Äî spreads in it, and it will be impossible to clean it from there. <br><br>  And now the paragraph for the patient: (focus, watch your hands) are you reading this post for free now?  Consider how schizophrenic do you find the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpaying for this post? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Money should be taken from the one who is willing to pay them.</b>  Advertisers of habrakhabra are ready to pay, for the fact that there are many people here who are more likely to click on advertisements of a certain kind.  Ready to pay companies that have money and who need customer loyalty.  Companies are ready to pay (again), now for attracting valuable employees who are striving for professional growth (no wonder they read this site, right?).

      Attempt to take money from the user stalled in a long time.  The Internet all works according to the freemium scheme, occasionally offering to buy something, but already a physical thing in the online store.  At the same time, companies do not go bankrupt, and facebook and google show billions in profits, which proves the possibility of the existence of large businesses of this kind. <br><br>  In order to monetize content, you just need to redistribute three "chairs" that are in the offline business (take, for example, any writer) are occupied by the following people: author (writer), publisher (for example, book publisher) and user ( the classical scheme - he is the buyer, that is, the source of money).  What is the role of the three "chairs" in the economy of the Internet sample?  The author (nothing changes here, someone has to produce content) is a content publishing site that is interested in quality content to make money (all newspapers work this way, they pay a salary to journalists in the form of a salary, regardless of how well the last edition has been sold newspapers) and the consumer (but in no case a buyer, he gets everything for free).  Of course, the entire business process is based on advertising.  Everything related to the production of intangible content falls under this scheme. <br><br>  Unviable?  The film can not recoup their costs by advertising?  Computer game can not?  The writer can not?  Look for other methods.  Why TV shows live at the expense of TV channels (that is, in the end, it‚Äôs still due to advertising), and films cannot with such a powerful source of income as cinemas (the pleasure of watching a home screen is doubtful, if the film promises good quality, it‚Äôs all the same go, two billion charges "Avatar" proved it once again)? <br><br>  Computer game - the task is more difficult.  But it can also be solved - break the content into parts using the ‚Äúserial‚Äù method.  Insert ads.  Switch to the freemium model.  Experiment. <br><br>  A writer who cannot monetize his product is simply a theorist cut off from life.  While much less intelligent (in his opinion) colleagues from pen get good money in journalism and even (!) In fiction, but in the periodical, he sits and writes the Great Roman (tm), which will be ingenious.  While people who can qualitatively associate more than three words, in the afternoon you will not find fire. <br><br>  Do not believe scammers who complain that they cannot make money without paying the user directly.  How can the user say - for the number of bigboards that I meet on the way to work, I still have to pay extra. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91151/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91151/</a></p>
