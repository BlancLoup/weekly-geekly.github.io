  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of overseas podcast services</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Evan Williams is known as the co-founder of Pyra Labs and the developer of one of the first blogger platform <a href="http://blogger.com/">Blogger.com</a> on the Internet, which <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/lenta/645/">turned out to be exactly seven years old</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After Evan successfully sold the former business to the giant Google, he founded a new startup <a href="http://odeo.com/">Odeo</a> , which has now become one of the largest podcasting portals on the Internet.  In his <a href="http://evhead.com/hodgepodge/podcast-sites-alexa.html">review,</a> Evan Williams conducts a small analysis of this market segment with a list of the largest players, as well as their popularity (Alexa <a href="http://alexa.com/">statistics</a> are used, which is not distinguished, however, by high reliability). <br><br>  According to Alexa statistics, the most popular podcasting site today is <a href="http://libsyn.com/">Libsyn</a> ( <a href="http://libsyn.com/">7134th</a> most popular website on the Internet over the past week).  This company started its activity quite a long time ago and did it intelligently, opening hosting for podcasts and luring away to itself some famous podcasters (both audio and video).  Then tariff plans were introduced for them (from $ 5 per month).  Most likely, Alexa statistics does not reflect the great popularity of this service, because the main part of its traffic is generated by files, rather than web browsing.  The lion's share of site traffic is most likely provided by the podcasters themselves, who come in to check the download statistics (they love to do this). <br><br>  The second place in the rating of podcast services was taken by startup Evan Williams <a href="http://odeo.com/">Odeo</a> (rating 7304).  Since its launch in July 2005, this service has repeatedly changed the business model.  It started as a catalog of podcasts (audio only) with very advanced features for its time: one-click subscription, own client for downloading, player on the web page and even some functionality of the social network.  Later added the ability to create podcasts directly through the site (web sound recording program).  Then the design of the site was changed, and the focus shifted to the exchange of audio messages, listening to online and social network, that is, to audioblogging.  Tools for creating offline podcasts and even an interface for uploading files have moved to another <a href="http://studio.odeo.com/">Odeo Studio</a> website.

      The third most popular place in the world of podcasting today is <a href="http://podomatic.com/">Podomatic</a> (rating 10878).  This is the most universal site that you can imagine.  There is absolutely everything: hosting podcasts, directory and social network, audiomail, etc. <br><br>  The top five also includes the services of <a href="http://podcastpickle.com/">Podcast Pickle</a> (15012) and <a href="http://podshow.com/">Podshow</a> (15603).  The first is a catalog of audio and video podcasts with a popular forum.  The second is very similar to Odeo in its set of functions, but it provides services to some of the most famous US podcasters and works in conjunction with several other podcasting services. <br><br>  In sixth place is one of the oldest <a href="http://podcastalley.com/">PodcastAlley</a> catalogs.  At one time it was the first service where a rating of podcasts was compiled through a popular vote.  Naturally, podcasters caught up on the site an audience of their listeners, which also contributed to the growth of the resource‚Äôs popularity. <br><br>  The popular site with podcasting news and the <a href="http://www.podcastingnews.com/">Podcasting News</a> catalog is in seventh place. <br><br>  The unremarkable <a href="http://podcast.net/">Podcast.net</a> catalog ranks first in the Google issue for the keyword ‚Äúpodcast‚Äù and <a href="http://podcast.net/">thus</a> maintains its position in the top ten podcast sites. <br><br>  Of the remaining services mentioned in the review by Evan Williams, we can distinguish <a href="http://podtech.net/">PodTech</a> (received $ 5.5 million in venture financing in March of this year).  This is the most well-known of the content-broadcasting podcasting companies, which have appeared a lot lately.  She recently hit the front pages of newspapers when she hired Robert Scoble, a famous blogger who recently left her previous job at Microsoft. <br><br>  You can also highlight the site <a href="http://podcast.com/">Podcast.com</a> , on which cybersquatters have placed a kind of podcast directory and do not stop trying to sell a domain name for an amount of about $ 250 thousand. <br><br>  Separate from all of the above services is the <a href="http://podcasts.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Podcasts</a> directory, opened in October 2005. There is no Alexa statistics for this site because it is located on a subdomain.  It can be assumed that this is the most popular podcast directory on the Internet.  In particular, the number of subscribers to the most popular podcast is almost 9000 people, whereas, for example, the <a href="http://odeo.com/channel/35509/view">most popular podcast</a> on Odeo listens by subscription to half the audience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4321/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4321/</a></p>
