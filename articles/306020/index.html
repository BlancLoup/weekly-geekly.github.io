  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HR work in the eyes of the developer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, my name is Yevgeny Kovalevich-Krutsan, I have a wife and a son.  In search of a stable job, I changed 4 companies and tried myself in different areas of activity.  I wrote software for a state project, was a manager in a large company, was a student and teacher, worked as a programmer and was a designer, tried to open my business, worked on freelancing, was engaged in sales, was an organizer of events and captain of game teams. <br><br>  I visited dozens of interviews and noticed that many companies make the same mistakes.  Service for finding a job in the IT industry, "My Circle" asked me to talk about the most popular mistakes consultants for recruitment during interviews with programmers. <br><br>  Now I work as a senior developer in the Brandivision company and lead my projects.  I got to Brandivision largely because their entire recruiting process was correctly and correctly built: <br>  - My interview was scheduled the same day when I responded to the vacancy. <br>  - I was not offered practical tasks; there was only an oral survey on technologies and skills. <br>  - The trial period of the trial period passed remotely, it lasted only a week, during which it was necessary to close several tasks in a large project.  A week later, I organically joined the workflow and actively collaborated with key specialists of the company.

First acquaintance with the company </h2><br>  This happens long before the programmer responds to the vacancy, or rather, from the moment when he first learns about the company.  Much can lead to misunderstandings: a strange statement by the company in the media, former employees with negative opinions, problems with the technical implementation of the prepared projects and much more. <br><br>  It is better for the company‚Äôs management to put more effort into creating an attractive company image and a strong HR brand for potential candidates. <br><br><h2>  2. First contact </h2><br>  When the programmer begins to look for work and the company enters his zone of interest, an open phase of acquaintance begins.  He is looking for information about the company, and it is beneficial for the HR department to receive it from the company's sources. <br><br>  As soon as the programmer has sent a letter with a response, he is waiting for an answer.  It is desirable that recruiters respond as quickly as possible, and the answer is competent and detailed.  The applicant needs to know that the HR department has read his resume and wants to discuss the nuances.  During this acquaintance, an idea is formed of the company's interest in a specialist and the coherence of the work of all departments. <br><br>  How the employer processed the application plays an important role.  If, in response to an application, the programmer immediately receives a test task, he is unlikely to be happy to start it right there.  But if the HR-specialist has studied the resume, and then clarifies the nuances of interest, presents the company, then the programmer is more likely to take up a test task or accept an offer from such a company.  Responding to the applicant's application, it is important to understand that programmers often do not indicate all of their knowledge and skills, hoping to tell in more detail about their capabilities during a personal meeting. <br><br>  Also an important indicator is the speed of response to the application.  If the company responds within 4 hours of a standard business day, the programmer will make contact with her, and not with another company.  If in a day - this is also acceptable, but such a company will be one step behind the companies with the same offer.  If at all in 2 weeks, at 3 o'clock in the morning, your answer will not even be read, because by this time there will already be enough companies with which the communication is already being conducted.  Get ready for the fact that most often in such situations you will be answered "Thank you, but the job is found, the offer is no longer relevant." <br><br><h2>  3. First meeting </h2><br>  After the first meeting, the developer, as a rule, eliminates most of the companies.  The reason may be the appearance and technical equipment of the office, how a person will be met, who and in what way he will communicate with him.  Of great importance is the moment of personal acquaintance. <br><br>  There may be two options for the development of the plot.  Or, the first meeting takes place only with an HR specialist: at this meeting, personal moments, the reasons for searching and choosing this particular company, are simply clarified.  Or, in the absence of an HR specialist, a meeting with technical specialists and technical director takes place: they should be as competent as possible in the field of interest to the applicant.  In this case, oral or written verification takes place, there is a dialogue about the company, its activities, prospects, and related points of possible cooperation are specified.  During this communication, it comes to understanding whether this specialist is specifically suited for this company. <br><br><h2>  4. The main stage of dating </h2><br>  After the personal communication began, the programmer and the company check each other.  The employer must understand that if a programmer is suitable for him, then he is certainly suitable for others.  Naturally, the candidate for ethical reasons will not talk about the proposals of competitors, but will evaluate the potential employer and monitor how the company builds relations with it: how it conducts an interview, whether it takes the initiative.  He will also compare working conditions, financial, additional bonuses and the overall atmosphere in the company. <br><br>  For example, sometimes a developer has to write his own HR specialists to find out if a vacancy is still open.  And there are cases when HR himself writes, clarifies your working status, finds out if you have enough information about the company, answers additional questions, finds out your opinion about the visit to the company and offers a position. <br><br>  When the programmer has completed the test task, discussed with the employer the subtleties of work and organizational issues, there comes a time when he needs to pass an oral technical interview.  Most often it is conducted by the technical director and the head of the department in which this candidate will work. <br><br><h2>  5. The end (win / lose) </h2><br>  At this stage, the employer decides whether this candidate is suitable for him.  And the programmer, in turn, decides whether everything suits him in the future employer and the proposed conditions. <br><br>  It is important to understand that applicants initially turn to a large number of companies when looking for a job.  Of the several companies, the applicant wants to choose the one where he will be more comfortable working and where he sees the greatest opportunity for developing his professional skills. <br><br>  For example, I had a situation when I could go to a large company, but at the same time I would have to deal only with the development of components of the company's system.  This option was initially lost, because working as a team with a lead in a smaller company, I could work with a wide range of responsibilities.  At that time, on the one hand, there was the name of a well-known company, and on the other, the ability to influence the development and be responsible for the whole department of the company.  And although I then refused both offers, but preference was given in favor of the work of the team Lead. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Today, the applicant in IT, as a rule, will be noticed by several companies and he undergoes several interviews almost simultaneously.  And it is the applicant who is in the role of the ‚Äúmerchant‚Äù himself who chooses the ‚Äúgoods‚Äù.  It is very important for employers to organize a recruitment process well in which all participants can make decisions quickly and competently.  At the same time, whatever the outcome of your cooperation talks, it is advisable to stay in touch and maintain good relationships. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306020/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306020/</a></p>
