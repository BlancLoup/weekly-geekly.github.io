And somehow it turned out that the community fantasized more about ‚Äúhow to implement it technically,‚Äù than wondered ‚Äúwhat could all this lead to in such a wonderful country as the Russian Federation‚Äù.  And this may lead to what (some sad May Day thoughts) ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A simple guglezh shows that the current leaders of the Russian market - VISA and MasterCard - are <a href="http://lenta.ru/articles/2014/04/30/card/">not particularly enthusiastic about the law</a> .  In short: these companies should <s>give a paw</s> to the account of the Bank of Russia a certain ‚Äúsecurity deposit‚Äù, which, in fact, exceeds the annual income of these companies in this country 10 times. For obvious reasons, payment systems do not hurry to do this It means that since July 1, debit and credit cards issued in the Russian Federation can become very valuable pieces of plastic, which are quite convenient to open the latches on all types of electronics cases - and that's all. <br><br>  In this regard, I wanted to fantasize a little on the subject of further developments on the return to the Middle Ages.

    <h4>  Item 1. Banks </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2bd/464/389/2bd464389f4f5fc6bbfa3eb4f0517ef7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  For banks, this will be a very tangible blow that will come from several fronts: <br><ul><li>  First, clients of payroll projects will fall off. </li><li>  Secondly, in connection with the first, the flow of people who, thanks to payroll projects, are beginning to use other services, loans, for example, will decrease. </li><li>  Third, the acquiring service will become unclaimed, which also made it possible to earn some money. </li><li>  Fourth, disabling cards will entail massive requests for withdrawals of all cash, as well as significant reputational losses. </li></ul><br>  Thus, in the banking sector, everything will not be very smooth.  I think the deposit insurance agency will have to seriously prepare. <br><br><h4>  Item 2. Russian online trading </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/00a/086/ac5/00a086ac55f94912373c89590c00e9cd.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The advantage of online shopping is the ability to purchase the right one by paying with a card without leaving your home.  Stop!  Which card?  Now we will have to print a receipt, defend the queue in the offline Sberbank and, if all the details are correct, hope for three days for the money to arrive to the seller and send the goods. <br>  In general, with ideas about the development of online commerce, I would say goodbye. <br><br><h4>  Item 3. Shopping at foreign online stores </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/934/e94/0b8/934e940b843aedb4411ba213df2cc81a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I am afraid that somehow human-loving the store or PayPal would not be, but it is unlikely to agree on payment through the Sber ticket.  And that means - hello to the material iron curtain in all its glory.  Easy and elegant.  The only strange thing is: why was it necessary to spend the most valuable time of government officials discussing the reduction of the amounts of duty-free imports, if you can get rid of such an urgent problem? <br><br><h4>  Item 4. Personal security </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc3/963/b23/cc3963b231b05c243d9d9830dad48d68.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Cards bribed the fact that they gave the opportunity to carry all their money always with you.  There was no fear of being robbed.  From July 1, I suppose, "patsangs in the area" will develop a "treasure map": what office for what number of cashiers-accountants, in person, discard bills earned by honest labor to employees. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b5/1a1/1ee/4b51a11eeb5652075c88ee52dc3705b2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Another valuable property of cards: international and transparent currency conversion.  It was possible to travel abroad without any problems, taking with them the NC of paper dollars / euros only in case of an unforeseen situation.  Now, I think, we will have to count all foreign expenses "on the coast" and appreciate a handful of pieces of paper not cheaper than our own life. <br><br><h4>  Or maybe everything is not so scary and the National Payment System will save us all? </h4><br>  I believe that to do this in Russia (!) Before July 1 (!) Is unrealistic from the word "absolutely."  In addition, given the scale of drinking and irresponsibility on government projects, this scenario looks unscientific, at any deadline.  It‚Äôs even more unrealistic to integrate such a ‚ÄúNational‚Äù solution with real international payment systems. <br><br>  Conclusions ... All of them are politically incorrect, obscene and represent a purely personal opinion.  So maybe I exaggerate the size of the problem?  Discuss? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221599/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221599/</a></p>
