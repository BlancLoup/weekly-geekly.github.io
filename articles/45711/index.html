The primary goal was to show the relationship between site visits and promotional events both online and offline, but the process did not stop there ...

I was struck by the amount of funds, in the literal sense, "thrown out" on advertising, at a time when it was not possible to evaluate, spent the money or went into the bottomless pockets of advertisers. <br><br>  A few years later, I was attracted to the development of the city portal.  There was a problem of attracting new users in a limited budget, and my old idea was given the necessary kick to get it off the ground. <br><br><h4>  <b>What is it and why?</b> </h4>  It is not always possible to draw a relationship between the number of visits to the site (purchases made on the site, registrations of new users, etc. - in general by any <i>final user actions</i> [ <b>CAP</b> ]) and advertising campaigns carried out at some point in time or made on the site improvements.

      If in the case of Internet advertising everything is more or less transparent - we get reports on incoming users, then it is not so easy to evaluate offline advertising measures qualitatively and quantitatively.  As well as the change in <abbr title="User Final Actions">efficiency</abbr> after various changes in the structure, design or functionality of the site. <br><br>  I would like to design such a system with the help of which it would be possible to analyze the effectiveness of the money spent relative to return. <br><br><h4>  <b>Idea and consequences</b> </h4>  The initial idea was to display the ratio of the number of visits to <abbr title="User Final Actions">efficiency</abbr> in the timeline.  The person went to the site - the person performed some kind of expected action.  Or did not comply.  You can sit and think about how to convert traffic into real orders (applied to the online store) <br><br>  In the process of drawing on paper the layout of the weekly statistics, the following thoughts appeared: <br><ul><li>  Several types of events - ‚Äúlines‚Äù, quite flexibly and compactly characterizing an advertising campaign. </li><li>  Separate control for graphs statistics and "lines." </li><li>  The correlation between events, attendance and the actual result. </li><li>  <s>Why so little good beer?</s> </li><li>  The ability to integrate statistics with modules of a web-based CRM system. </li><li>  Try to implement a qualitative assessment of promotional activities.  Something like the relationship "how much money was spent / how much efficiency received." </li><li>  Improvements to the resource also cost money, and they can be divided conditionally into several types (like this: ‚Äúpatches, current updates and long-term‚Äù), respectively, it is necessary to somehow differentiate them. </li><li>  How to maximize the process of adding timelines. </li></ul><br>  It can be said that such a system can be linked up to the point of increasing the number of sold glasses of seeds and the appearance of a large sign ‚ÄúTasty fried seeds from Grandma Agafya‚Äù.  <sup>The image of a grandmother selling seeds with a netbook under the counter appeared unobtrusively in the brain :)</sup> .  But <b>in the example we‚Äôll talk about the correlation statistics module for an abstract online store</b> . <br><br><h4>  <b>What happened</b> </h4><ul><li>  The general concept of the statistics module. </li><li>  "Rulers" -timelines of various types. </li><li>  Efficiency markers on the chart. </li><li>  What a screen interface. </li></ul> <a href=""><img src="http://img146.imageshack.us/img146/6609/screenonecommonstatssmack7.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h4>  <b>What's next...</b> </h4>  Think over the unrealized points of the ‚ÄúIdeas‚Äù section, draw as much as possible. <br>  In the next post, expect easy-to-read graphics of large periods of time, animated work with "lines of events" and notes on efficiency.  <i>Unfortunately, or fortunately, I never know how to program, so this module will not go beyond the screenshots and general logic :(</i> <br><br><h4>  <b><b>Valuable comments and suggestions</b></b> </h4><ol><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/lasc/" class="user_link">lasc</a> noted that on his, damn large, monitor almost nothing is visible. <br>  <u>Alternatively, you can use flash or scalable SVG graphics.</u> <br></li><li>  <b>Here could be your comment</b> </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45711/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45711/</a></p>
