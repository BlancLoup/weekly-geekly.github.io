For the solution, there are various tools, but they are all based on funding in cash.  For example, if you have a starter product (MVP), help from the existing infrastructure (accelerators, business incubators) is mainly aimed at attracting investors. <br><br>  If the project is completely at the level of the idea, then the situation is aggravated by the lack of the possibility of obtaining the same financing, which in turn causes circular obsession of problems.  But on the other hand, there are other forms of incentives to rally people over the project, defined as the possibility of obtaining a stake in the future organization.

      True, the search for such people does not always happen efficiently, since in general the infrastructure (it is fragmented) is not available for this.  For this reason, in the IT sphere (as a community from which everything begins), there are already projects that improve this area, for example: <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/103854/">Cofounder.ru: a dating service for startups</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/294746/">Online service to find employees and partners for startups from IIDF</a> <br><br>  However, I would like to see an online platform ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/120935/">like this idea</a> ) that covers all areas more broadly (not just IT) and at the same time contributes to the emergence and use of other tools for bringing people and resources together, no less efficient than cash financing. <br><br>  In consequence of this, as well as taking into account the trends <a name="habracut"></a>  , such as: Crowd, blockchain, issue of tokens (ICO).  The essence of such a platform can be to change the methods of building an organization by self-organization in some online environment.  Where with the use of blockchains it becomes possible to <b>record the facts of investment</b> in a project carried out not only by finances, but also by <b>skilled labor</b> , and by any <b>other means</b> .  While maintaining the effect of investing due to the risk, since the project is never known to justify itself or not. <br><br>  <b><i>It is as follows:</i></b> <br><br>  <b>Social network of projects</b> (online service), where anyone can describe their own idea and invite the team to implement this project.  Or, it can join an already existing project, where, taking into account its competence (qualification), it solves the tasks set, or makes other investments, thereby fixing them in the blockchain by receiving PreCoin. <br><br>  PreCoin is a pre-coin with the following properties: <br><br><ul><li>  It is rigidly tied to a specific project, where ‚ÄúCoin‚Äù is replaced with the name of the project token (hereinafter PreToken). </li><li>  It is fixed in the blockchain, for the subsequent determination of shares (contribution level) in the project, depending on the number of accumulated coins, in relation to other participants. </li><li>  It has a color (similar to colored coins), which determines the participation segment (qualifications, ways of investing).  And may have additional properties. </li><li>  Credited: <br><br><ul><li>  Participant for qualified labor, measured by the measure of the volume (quantity) of perfect work, and not by the value of labor. </li><li>  When PreICO is held, investors who wish to contribute money to the project at the current stage, at an early stage when there is no product. </li><li>  Fixing investments of various other means: objects of labor (machine tools, equipment, etc.), premises, etc.  Determined from the estimated value of the investment. </li></ul></li><li>  It has no value, in other words, it cannot be sold, transferred to other participants outside and inside this project, because it serves only as an indisputable contribution to the project, which has not yet proved its usefulness to society (did not stand on commercial rails). </li></ul><br>  Each user of an online service who invests his work has a CV with a confirmed qualification, in accordance with which he can take part in various projects, solving problems or creating them.  Outside of projects, all participants differ only in qualification, in other words, merits in one project cannot affect the rating of participation in another project, thus the equal rights of participants are preserved. <br><br>  Undoubtedly, human experience influences the speed of performing tasks and everyone would like to have just such an expert in a team.  But, first, the online service is based on Crowdsourcing, respectively, the team takes part in the project, where there will be several people of the same qualification (mostly).  Secondly, everyone takes part in the project on his own will and, accordingly, entrusts himself with the tasks with which he feels he will cope. <br><br>  Inside a specific project, everything happens according to the principle of meritocracy, i.e.  the participant‚Äôs rating in this project is formed, PreToken from work activity (number of completed tasks in accordance with qualifications) or from other forms of participation are accumulated.  The construction of the participants' interaction will be based on a flexible management methodology, where not the principle of subordination operates, but the methods of collective participation (horizontal management). <br><br>  At the beginning of the project indicates the percentage of redistribution for each method of investment.  A limited pool is allocated as a percentage of the future total number of preliminary coins, as well as a subpool in% of the total number of coins in a particular pool.  It also determines the minimum allowable% of the founders and the maximum allowable% of co-founders.  Due to the fact that the founder (the author of the idea / project) has at the very beginning 100% shares, which is eroded as new members (co-founders) arrive, the initial share of which is 0%.  In the course of the formation of the project, there may be adjustments, from the fairness or unfairness of the percentage distribution of shares. <br><br>  For example: <br>  At PreICO, 20% is allocated, other funds are included in the pool of dedicated PreICO, respectively, 80% are left for skilled labor.  In labor, you can set% in areas of qualification (marketing, PR, etc.).  PR (bounty) can be attributed to both the PreICO pool and the labor pool.  It depends on what will be the purpose of PR - advertising the project with the aim of financing or in order to attract customers. <br><br>  <b><i>Further directions</i></b> <br><br>  There will definitely be situations when some participants will need to convert PreToken to something that already has value.  For example, participants who influenced a project only once (having provided a one-time service or consultation), but who will not be in the future.  This is necessary for the project as well.  their departure, they erode less share.  Or situations when there are non-profit organizations, scientific, or projects that are useful, but not able to monetize.  It is for such solutions that the percentage and color redistribution will contribute, which will allow you to add additional solutions for different situations and circumstances, for example: <br><br><ul><li>  Market predictions.  Where participants voting with PreToken coins, get the opportunity to convert them into a trading Coin. </li><li>  Barter exchange. </li></ul><br>  In order to stimulate participants, lowering factors will be introduced so that they mainly solve tasks that are within their competence.  For this reason, there are not rare cases when a person, seeing the work of others, wishes to master this profession and solve problems without a reduction factor.  Since the world has long been transient, the best option would be - the <i>course system of education</i> . <br><br>  When there are ways to leave the project earlier, some participants who have invested their work will be given the opportunity to create - <i>Qualified pools</i> . <br><br>  <b><i>Prerequisites</i></b> <br><br>  The society has accumulated vast experience in various areas of life and with the growth of the level of communication, the Internet is becoming easier to unite for common interests, hobbies and crafts.  Thus we see: <br><br><ul><li>  Social networks, thematic resources, forums, etc. </li><li>  Crowd movement, which has already shown its effectiveness in the field of financing (Crowd-investing and Crowd-funding).  And also in the efficiency of the collective mind (rowdsourcing), to which the business is increasingly turning to solve their problems and get more productive feedback. </li><li>  Sharing economy networks where people provide each other with a variety of services. </li><li>  The appearance of DAO, etc. </li></ul><br>  Team building in the online service presented is essential, since it is they who determine the company's future and form its effectiveness, therefore: <br><br><ul><li>  At the beginning of any project, a certain Crowd-founder is first formed, among which are Co-founders.  In other words: working together is better than any interview. </li><li>  There are three things that motivate people to do a good job: autonomy, competence, and goal setting. </li><li>  A team is being formed in which everyone equally believes in the project, because the attitude is like one‚Äôs own. </li></ul><br>  <b><i>Conclusion</i></b> <br><br>  A preliminary coin is conditionally logging the activity (contribution) of a person participating in a project.  In case of success of the project, determined by the utility to the public (now it is measured by profit), the participant receives a share (reverse utility), commensurate with its contribution.  Such an approach will contribute to the processes of self-organization of society, which we are witnessing now during the movement of crowds (mainly in the financing processes, this is CrowdFunding, CrowdInvesting, ICO).  Self-organization, both in the classical forms of organizations (from small to large business), and in the "turquoise" (synergistic) organizations (you can read Habr <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/zpayment/blog/313414/">here</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/323532/">here</a> ). <br><br>  Also, this approach will contribute to the process of self-organization of ICO.  After all, the possibility of making a different contribution from the cash may begin to be valued, at a minimum, also to be used with the same frequency as cash financing. <br><br>  <i>And quite a futurological view</i> : perhaps the observed tokenization will affect the change in economic models, which is now built only on monetary circulation.  And the circulation of people's assets (tokens), really supported by some kind of activity and formed by people, will turn out to be the key (step) to the transition from the axiom of limited resources to the infinity of human abilities.  Then progress will appear and be realized faster, and not artificially slowed down. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">On this subject there is an anecdote about the catalog of reasonable civilizations.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  An alien arrives on Earth to add humans to the "Catalog of intelligent civilizations" and asks: <br>  - Why, with the abundance of land, water and light, many on Earth are starving? <br>  - No money left. <br>  ‚ÄúWhy so many homeless people with all your abilities?‚Äù <br>  - There is not enough money. <br>  - Why are you so foul on your planet? <br>  - There is no money to arrange otherwise. <br>  - Why are there so many patients who can be cured? <br>  - Not enough money. <br>  - What is this resource so scarce that you don't normally live?  Can you help him bring from other planets?  And in general, where do you get it? <br>  - It is not necessary to deliver, we print them ourselves. <br>  And struck out an alien earthlings from the list of sentient beings. <br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336016/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336016/</a></p>
