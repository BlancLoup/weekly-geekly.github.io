However, after just an hour or two, many are abandoning this venture, having gone through less than half of the photo archive and are tired of searching for unnecessary pictures among hundreds of NewNotes and dozens of DCIM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d5/2dc/0db/2d52dc0db919f3e06b92d013e5955fbe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We are in a hurry to live.  Our memories are stored in folders, merged from camera flash drives, synchronized with smartphones and ... forgotten.

The ability to move all the images found in one place on the PC is missing. <br><br>  <b>ZZ Photo</b> <br><br>  It is possible to copy selected images or all found images to one place on a computer.

The green bar in the header reminds the user that the photos shown are limited to a search query. <br><br>  <b>GooglePhoto, XnView</b> <br><br>  No tagging functionality. <br><br>  <b>Flickr</b> <br><br>  When importing photos, it is possible to assign a text tag, mark a person, add to an album or group.

For a more flexible request setting, there is Advanced Mode, in which you can customize the type of displayed content (photo / video), the period in which photos were taken and some other options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a14/9a0/ea9/a149a0ea9f3d1c2afe4ea37044b0a45a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>ZZ Photo</b> <br>  You can tag with three types of tags: text, geolocation, and noting faces in photos.  In the left panel there are preset text tags (Family, Friends, Work, Study, Travel, Hobbies).  If you wish, you can create personalized tags.  Photos tagged automatically form virtual albums for quick access to pictures of one category. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ec/416/c6b/1ec416c6be8ae1ba0875563bfbb1bc7a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The search is carried out by text tags, persons and geolocation tags.  Tags can be both expanding the search (find "Friends" and "Family"), and clarifying (find "Family", only "Travel"). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d48/27c/de6/d4827cde6b90f0df2d075f331e330bca.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>ACDSee</b> <br><br>  Explicitly there are no text tags in the application.
