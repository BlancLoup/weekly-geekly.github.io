  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thank god i'm not a manager</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I‚Äôve been working for a long time with DBA + database performance expert + <i>a lot more</i> in one large company.  The work is very comfortable, but for a while I was worried about the fact that my position is a dead end.  Growing up the career ladder is absolutely impossible for me: I am the only person in the Russian office who reports directly to America.  All the rest here is engineering. <br><br>  Since I am in Russia, I will never be made a manager, because I am far away, because I am in another time zone, and in general, these <i>russian hackers ...</i> But now another reason has been added - I don‚Äôt want that.  Why?  Just look Scheduling Assistant in Outlook on the schedule of American managers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/py/fq/ex/pyfqexwvhox5j6jej9z0vbtyddq.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A couple of explanations - I removed myself, the evening time is due to the time zone difference, they don‚Äôt accept all the rallies, so they also sit at the rave meetings, they just didn‚Äôt send a formal accept.  Often the rallies they go ‚Äúend to end‚Äù for 5-6 hours.  Honestly, I do not understand how they solve the problem with the natural secretions of the body - I, for example, drink coffee all the time, and should allocate it.  When they manage to do it - a mystery to me.

      Meanwhile, I work comfortably in the office, if I'm too lazy ‚Äî I work at home or take a day off, the first half of the day, before America wakes up, everything is quiet and peaceful.  I enjoy all sorts of hobbies and even write articles on Habr√©.  What is the fate of a techie who decided to devote himself to career growth?  To me, it looks like this: <br><br>  1. On the plane of technical knowledge there is a bulge.  This is a talented techie.  He is above the others.  He was noticed <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5m/pw/jz/5mpwjz_esg2qvev-tb3mk6csoz0.png"><br><br>  2. The bulge grows.  He is more and more pulling on different issues.  Perhaps he was formally <s>given yellow pants</s> (team lead, senior something, etc.) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jv/xd/iz/jvxdiz8iurg40nob86r83n4y9jm.png"><br><br>  3. This is already a manager, but he has not lost touch with the technical part.  In fact, this is a very good manager.  I had the good fortune to work with such (and watched all the previous stages) - he was in charge, but if anything - could lift everything from scratch - VMware, NetApp, the network - anything <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ui/us/ol/uiusolcs6etc6hivfebll8kqata.png"><br><br>  4. ‚ÄúJumper‚Äù is torn.  Now the man has become an absolute manager.  He does everything by someone else.  In technical terms, he can continue to develop ‚Äúon the tops‚Äù - to read about new versions of products, but his practical skills froze at the moment of breaking the jumper.  We can recognize such managers by their favorite technologies, for example, techie, who went to managers in the 90s will be a balm for discussing the transfer of data between components in the form of files and waiting for them to periodically check their presence. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/kn/tb/rtkntbrszo8svwlewwmrwipsoao.png"><br><br>  5. ‚ÄúDrop‚Äù pops up in a corporate environment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dw/mj/i8/dwmji8et0hqo6sir0e68xbtzcm4.png"><br><br>  This stage is the worst for the manager. <br><br>  A technician at work has two types of knowledge: technical (how to write a checker) and <i>company-wise</i> (how to fill the timesheet correctly, where it is better to contact if there is such a problem, what workflow to achieve where you want, and generally <i>thinner</i> - to crawl faster).  If you work in a small team, then the second component is very small.  In a large bureaucratic company, it is very large, but managers are almost entirely comprised of company-wise knowledge. <br><br>  You can go to another company and you will be asked for an interview ... what we recently had on Habr√© ... how to invert a javascript.  But the middle manager has almost no knowledge, invariant to the company.  Unless the ability to work with people, the success story - but it's not easy. <br><br>  Managers of the highest flight acquire ‚Äúinvariance‚Äù - they managed network X for the sale of <i>units</i> - you can safely manage the production of electric cars.  A CV is abbreviated to the first and last name of <i>Bond, James Bond</i> .  I can not quote Stanislav Lem: <br><br><blockquote>  Children born on Zazyav, receive a huge number of titles and titles, as well as the name, according to our concepts unusually long. <br><br>  Appearing at the time, Magister Oh received the name Gridipidagitositopopocarturtegvauanatosatotutvontam.  They called him the Pillars of Existence, the Doctor of Perfect Meekness, the Luminary of Probability Comprehensiveness, etc., etc. As he grew and studied, from year to year he was taken away by rank and by name.  and since he discovered extraordinary abilities, then at the 33rd year of his life he didn‚Äôt have a single rank, and the name was defined only by one, and even then a mute, letter of the zazyavskogo alphabet meaning ‚Äúpalate aspiration‚Äù - this is something like a suppressed sigh, which is pulled out from an excess of reverence or pleasure. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Of course, not everything is so bad - in DEV managers manage the development of complex products, products that cannot be written ‚Äúin one go‚Äù.  They, like captains of a ship, stand on the bridge and see how something big is born.  But alas, in the ‚Äúadmin‚Äù IT, most often these are other tasks, for example: <br><br><ul><li>  What are these old servers, what is spinning on them, and how to turn them off if no one knows why they are? </li><li>  Write an Incident report to the client about the absolutely incomprehensible bluescreen on his server, and try to squeeze out the answer to the question ‚Äúwhat would you do to prevent this from happening‚Äù </li><li>  Find out that the security group has stabbed some rights - and understand how to live with it now </li><li>  Once a year, devote a month to passing the audit about 100+ points, each of which requires at least one rally </li><li>  To think what to do if two key members of the team leave, and considering the search, their replacement will be in three months.  And how to work without them - no one is interested - <b># tyzhmenedzher</b> </li></ul><br>  And how much are you ready to hang on the phone? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447890/">https://habr.com/ru/post/447890/</a></p>
