We have formed a design system on which media projects work, a mobile web and partially productivity services (other products are gradually connected), a style of pictograms and illustrations has been formed, promotional letters and promotional sites are standardized.  Of course, not all services are good yet, but somewhere the first redesign did not solve all the problems, but it is difficult not to notice a huge leap over the years.  To speed up the update process and make our work public, we open out part of our <a href="http://design.mail.ru/paradigm/">design system Paradigm</a> (this is an internal tool, there is no mobile version yet). <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/333510/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e40/c5b/6b4/e40c5b6b4c563c58d1b5862745d8d5b8.jpg" alt="Paradigm - Mail.Ru Group design system, part 1: visual language" width="780" height="439"></a> <br><br>  What is a design system in our understanding? <br><br><ol><li>  Visual language - defines how we create product interfaces.  As in ordinary language, we have the alphabet (variables), words (interface elements), sentences (components), and whole texts (screens and products).  The alphabet is unchanged, the vocabulary gradually changes over time, but the sentences and texts of them are always different.  It is shown on <a href="http://design.mail.ru/paradigm/">design.mail.ru/paradigm/</a> . </li><li>  Uniform components at the technological level - the only source of truth.  The design is ‚Äústitched‚Äù into them, services are received and updated from a single repository.  Products under the Mail.Ru brand that use them in practice: media projects, mobile web, part of productivity services.  They are still available only within the company. </li><li>  Templates for designer tools - a way to quickly show an idea, just high-level sketches.  In an ideal situation, layouts are not made up, but assembled from single components.  We <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/319884/">wrote about them at the beginning of the year</a> . </li></ol><br>  Having started the implementation of the design system in 2012, in 2015 we formed its holistic vision.  There are a lot of things ahead, but the publication of current developments is a pleasant milestone in the development of the platform (funny that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jvetrau/posts/10152329241103250">three years ago portal navigation was updated on a large scale</a> ).  We described in detail the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/333510/">general principles and the current state on Habr√©</a> .  We welcome feedback and advice. <br><br>  PS By the way, we launched two news channels for announcements of the design team on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mailrudesign/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mailrudesign">Twitter</a> .

Nathan Curtis describes a phased implementation plan for the platform and gives tips on working with product teams.  Continuing the theme: <br><br><ul><li>  Ryan Rumsey talks about how <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/selling-a-design-system-before-asking-for-buy-in-eeb45e88f66a">the Electronic Arts infrastructure team created and promoted the Joystick design system</a> .
