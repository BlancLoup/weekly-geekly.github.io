Of course, in order not to feel deprived, we could start bringing Soviet fakes to Nintendo products to classes.  Perhaps you remember these games: ‚ÄúWell, wait a minute‚Äù, ‚ÄúMickey Mouse‚Äù, etc. A whole series of handheld games from the company ‚ÄúElectronics‚Äù.  But by that time they were all outdated and would hardly have had the desired effect.  And besides, as for me, it was just hellish timekillers who beat right through, smearing the children's nervous system on the walls. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  To our great happiness, this very guy, being from a very wealthy family, had no idea that he needed to appreciate what you had, and he very soon got tired of the console.  Here is the GameBoy and went from hand to hand.  Each one, taking into account its four ‚Äúfinger-type‚Äù batteries, could take it for a day, or even two.

      We had only one game, a name that I don‚Äôt remember now.  An ordinary arcade with a side view.  Character, something like a bun.  The main difference from the fabulous hero was that this guy devoured everyone he met and grew from this to a very impressive size.  Despite the primitiveness of the gameplay, there was something about it.  Some of my classmates managed to spend the night playing on the flight, hiding under a blanket with a flashlight. <br><br>  And then, someone from my friends got their first PS ... <br><br>  It took a lot of time.  I already forgot about those glorious days when parents forbade sitting at the TV for a long time in Dendy, and grandmothers believed that the computer created by the devil would bring you to blindness faster than onanism. <br><br>  Some time ago I read Alex Garland's The Beach.  Yes, it was for this book that Danny Boyle shot his film.  Although it is not about that.  The protagonist, Richard, in between smoking grass and crazy war games, baked in the GameBoy, sitting an asshole on the hot sand.  While reading the book, an unclear feeling of nostalgia for the old days woke up in me and decided to get GameBoy by all means.  I do not mean the Advance series.  I'm talking about the good old, almost the size of a videotape, GameBoy Original. <br><br>  After making sure that there was no longer a sale of this miracle, I began to search through various online flea markets.  Despite the fact that my search did not give any results, several times I was still close to my goal.  As a result, I posted an ad with the offer to buy for a small amount a stray old GameBoy.  That same evening, a woman called me with an offer to sell two GBCs, $ 10 each.  Since this was the only option, I suggested to my friend that I take the second one, as we did in the end. <br><br>  I got in a transparent case with a cartridge which was stuffed with about 20 games.  For the most part, the Japanese slag is not clear, but there are some excellent things, such as Tetris, Sonic, Frogger, Space Invaders, as well as Battle City (in common people - tanchiki).  GBC, this is certainly not quite what I wanted, but after some reflection, I decided that it was even better.  It is smaller in size, it works on two batteries and in addition to color games, it also supports old toys from its predecessor.  True, the presence of an infrared port I, for myself, could not explain. <br><br>  Someone will say that this is complete nonsense and that it would be much easier to run the desired game on the emulator, but it's not about the games, but about trying to return to the long-forgotten, but fairly bright moments of life. <br><br>  GAME OVER </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95966/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95966/</a></p>
