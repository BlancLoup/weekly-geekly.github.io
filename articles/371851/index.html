  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pay bitcoins and be healthy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Cash and bank cards pose many dangers.  Not only is it easy to steal them, and banks and credit companies will rip off three skins for cash-outs and any transaction - by touching them you can get a whole bunch of infections.  On the surface of banknotes, debit, credit cards there is a huge amount of pollution, among which you can find a variety of pathogenic bacteria, fecal masses and particles of narcotic substances, <a href="http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2012/dirty_money.html">scientists say</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/264/feb/368/264feb36889840e7a9c4642fdfbb54aa.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The combination of an outdated banking system and a monetary model, which is three thousand years old, cannot be compared with the digital, decentralized, cryptocurrency economy: using a traditional system is not only costly, it is dangerous to health.  The choice in favor of bitcoins has many hidden and clear advantages, one of which is minimizing the risk of contact with dangerous bacteria. <br><br><h2>  Cash - a hotbed of infections </h2><br>  As a result of a number of studies, scientists were able to identify and classify millions of different bacteria and harmful substances on the surface of the banknotes in circulation.  For example, researchers at the Wright Patterson Medical Center in Dayton, Ohio examined the surface of 68 dollar bills and found 87% of banknotes a bacterium that could trigger a generalized infection in people with impaired immune systems, such as those suffering from human immunodeficiency virus or <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story%3Fid%3D117433%26page%3D1">cancer</a> .

    <blockquote>  ‚ÄúWhen the bacterium spreads through bank notes, the infection is almost impossible to prevent,‚Äù the scientists explain, ‚Äúyou can try to keep your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth so that the bacteria do not enter the body, wash your hands more often, that's all.‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Not only dangerous microorganisms can be detected on cash, but also particles of narcotic drugs, such as cocaine.  According to <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1914560_1914558_1914544,00.html">Time magazine</a> , most dollar bills in circulation in the United States bear traces of cocaine. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúDrug dealers recount bills with coca-stained hands; when using a drug, many people use banknotes to inhale powder, brushes and rollers at ATMs and cash counters distribute particles of substance to all other banknotes.‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Time Magazine cites an excerpt from a study published in the Southern Medical Journal in 2002, the authors of which claim that pathogenic particles, including staphylococci, are present on 94% of the banknotes tested.  The authors of the same study concluded that particles of the influenza virus found on the surface of cash.  remain viable and can be distributed through the exchange of banknotes for 17 days. <br><br><h2>  Plastic is not cleaner paper </h2><br>  Unfortunately, credit and plastic cards are <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bank-card-fecal-bacteria-contaminated-germs_n_1971609.html%3F1350617226%3D%26section%3Dindia%26utm_hp_ref%3Dhealth-news">also infected with</a> bacteria and fecal organisms.  According to a study by Shannon McQweig, a professor at the Department of Natural Sciences at St. Petersburg University, methicillin-resistant form of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is equally common on the surface of banknotes and plastic cards. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe are talking about a certain type of staphylococcus that has developed resistance to antibiotics, which, as a rule, treat standard staphylococcal infections,‚Äù explains the researcher.  McKweig and his research team found MRSA at 50% of all credit cards studied, <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/mrsa-found-on-80-percent-of-dollar-bills-according-to-spc-study">reports Examiner</a> . <br><br><h2>  Bitcoin is cheaper to use and safer for health </h2><br>  In addition to the indicated risks, it should be added that fiat banknotes and plastic cards are expensive.  Banks and credit card companies issuing plastic cards charge exorbitant fees, which sellers have to pay, who transfer this responsibility to buyers, who pay millions of dollars to processing companies servicing their credit and debit cards.  In addition, a separate fee is charged for servicing a bank account, especially noticeable for those whose incomes are low.  An article in the Economist magazine titled <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21663262-why-low-income-americans-often-have-pay-more-its-expensive-be-poor">‚ÄúBeing poor is expensive‚Äù</a> describes in detail why low-income Americans are often forced to pay more for financial services than wealthy fellow citizens, which is equally true for emigrants who send money to loved ones. <br><br>  As you know, using bitcoins does not require bank accounts and cards, identity theft ceases to be an actual risk, as well as inflation.  Cryptocurrencies can significantly reduce the cost of financial services and speed up the process of their implementation.  Since bitcoin transactions are carried out through a browser, e-wallet or smartphone, there is no need to sign checks, enter a pin code, count bills or roll a card, exposing your health to unnecessary danger. <br><br>  To prevent possible risks to your health, start mining Bitcoins with the Hashflare cloud mining <a href="https://hashflare.io/">service</a> now. <br> <a href="https://hashflare.io/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D271180"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb1/57f/5f9/eb157f5f90f54032aa2b80b1c2973a73.png" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371851/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371851/</a></p>
