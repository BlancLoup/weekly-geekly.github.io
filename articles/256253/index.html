Servers with support for the new generation of processors Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 contain a number of innovations.  Along with increased performance, one of the most significant innovations is the support for the new DDR4 memory standard. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Memory modules of this standard can have a capacity of up to 128 gigabytes and operate at frequencies from 2133 to 4266 MHz, have reduced power consumption, and their performance is 1.5 times higher than that of previous memory modules.  The Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processor has a maximum cache size of the third level of 45 MB, the maximum number of cores is 18, and taking into account the HyperThreading technology, the number of processors visible by the operating system can reach 36. The speed of QPI buses is increased to 9.6 gigatransactions per second .  Dual-processor servers themselves with support for Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 are available in familiar configurations with a height of 1 or 2U. <br><br>  HP has expanded its product portfolio of computing platforms, complementing it with new HP ProLiant Gen9 servers designed for small businesses with a limited budget, as well as remote offices and branches of large companies.  The <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/proliant-servers/product-detail.html%3Foid%3D7500984">HP ProLiant DL60 Gen9</a> dual-processor rack-mount servers in 1U and <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/proliant-servers/product-detail.html%3Foid%3D7500985">ProLiant DL80 Gen9</a> in the 2U package, launched in December 2014, are positioned by the vendor as extremely cost-effective solutions with basic technical and operational indicators.  However, only the extensibility of internal subsystems was sacrificed to the price - the servers of the so-called ‚Äútenth‚Äù series can carry only low-cost LFF disks, a limited set of processors (heat dissipation is limited to 105 watts) and memory capacity limited by 8 modules (with 32 GB modules currently available). The amount is limited to 256 GB per server).  High build quality, European assembly, full control with iLO and OneView systems are available in these budget machines. <br><br>  The new servers are built in accordance with the principles of optimization for workloads, software configuration and readiness for use in cloud solutions, which are characteristic of the entire HP ProLiant family.  Their architecture is optimized in such a way that the system is inexpensive, but at the same time provides sufficient computing power and ease of management for most tasks.  These compact servers are especially suitable for providers and small / medium companies.  The HP ProLiant DL80 Gen9 server in a 2U package differs from the DL60, above all, by the wider scalability of the storage subsystem.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fd/efb/0f9/6fdefb0f999643d880ef9711cf00ef21.jpg"><br><br>  The HP ProLiant DL60 Gen9 model in the 1U package has a standard appearance for servers of this class.  The contents of the shipping package includes the server itself, the power cord, equipment documentation and software, as well as equipment and documentation for rack mounting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14f/c8b/031/14fc8b031c9b49eb83c8abc781c371b1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cad/901/0ff/cad9010ff629497d84251ed74261403e.jpg"><br><br>  In front of the server there are four LFF disk drives (that is, a 3.5 "form factor). In hot mode, they are not replaced, but the system also supports hot-swappable HDDs and solid-state drives SSD. Please note that when ordering a server in without hot swapping disks with an empty disk shelf (that is, without disks) you get a server with HP empty slides (and not with plugs, as before). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a84/559/42c/a8455942c35e4ef289d090c848840f86.jpg"><br><br>  The standard configuration of the DL60 server includes one or two Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processors clocked at up to 3 GHz and three PCI Express 3.0 expansion slots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f6/578/81b/0f657881bde24d18b6d311a0cfb0e88b.jpg"><br><br>  The server provides for the installation of up to six fan modules (depending on the number of processors).  By default, fans do not imply hot-swapping, but this option can be ordered separately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/689/31b/2d2/68931b2d2ea241c7a891ca0de4d23689.jpg"><br><br>  The HP Smart Socket mechanism makes it easy to install the processor without the risk of ‚Äúbreaking firewood‚Äù (that is, breaking contacts on the motherboard).  This may be required, for example, when upgrading the system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7aa/272/b6f/7aa272b6f39e4e35af1fea6c9b1a9884.jpg"><br><br>  The capacity of the server's RAM is up to 256 GB - up to eight HP DDR4 Smart Memory DIMM modules operating with a clock frequency of up to 2133 MHz.  The smart features built into HP SmartMemory increase productivity, reduce downtime and reduce power consumption.  The use of DDR4 memory allows you to increase bandwidth by 14% compared to conventional memory due to the support of the maximum frequency even with 2 modules per channel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/201/90d/9cc/20190d9cc10146bc9c93e8901e330999.jpg"><br><br>  The <b><a href="http://www.hp.com/go/ilo/docs">HP iLO</a></b> subsystem is a standard component of HP ProLiant servers that simplifies initial system configuration, monitors its status, optimizes power and temperature, and also remotely administers.  It includes a microprocessor, protected memory and a network interface.  HP iLO works independently of the server and operating system.  SNMP alerts can be sent directly by the HP iLO subsystem, even if the operating system is not installed. <br><br>  HP iLO allows you to do the following: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Get access to a secure remote server console from anywhere in the world if there is a network connection to the server. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Use a shared .NET remote console to work together four server administrators. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Remotely connect virtual media to the server. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Perform secure remote monitoring of the server‚Äôs power status. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Implement management-free agent management using SNMP alerts. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Download the active protection system log. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Register with HP Insight Remote Support. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Use iLO Federation to manage unlimited large groups of servers through a single iLO web interface. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Use scripts to perform various tasks, including automation of deployment and preparation for work. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Manage your iLO subsystem using a remote management tool. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fa/e24/da3/3fae24da393849d9aca1ff50e63ae6a0.jpg"><br><br>  The standard server configuration includes the HP DynamicSmart Array B140i software RAID controller.  The built-in SATA HP Dynamic Smart Array B140i controller is typically used to connect boot devices, but it can also serve as the only controller in a budget configuration.  You can also choose any HP Smart Array hardware controller with enhanced performance (12 Gbps SAS), better data security using cache memory and built-in hardware data encryption on local drives (HP Secure Encryption license required).  As an intermediate option between the built-in and full-fledged P-series RAID controller, an HBA adapter can be used, which can also work in RAID mode (without cache) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a79/2ef/580/a792ef5808594ef2abfb54db15ef0d3a.jpg"><br><br>  The HP Smart Storage battery protects the data of the Write Cache module in the event of a power failure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a3d/d96/4a7/a3dd964a7d1b4e8ea44ec29620988216.jpg"><br><br>  Expansion slots PCI Express 3.0 will help, if necessary, to increase the bandwidth of the server I / O subsystem.  Easily accessible PCI contact strips make the installation of expansion cards convenient and quick, making system maintenance easier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df3/2bc/213/df32bc213f1a4a749bcae8b0485fe979.jpg"><br><br>  ProLiant DL60 Gen9 servers support 550-watt, non-hot-plug, initial-level power supplies, or optional Gold power supplies with 800 watts (redundant) or 900 watts (non-redundant).  The efficiency (efficiency) of such power supplies reaches 92%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/060/c03/73f/060c0373f7b0414e8d51ab7bd1b12dd0.jpg"><br><br>  On the back of the server there are also a port for connecting a monitor, three USB 3.0 ports and one USB 2.0, a slot for microSD memory cards.  Also available are card readers for microSD cards that plug into the USB port of the server and provide the ability to combine 2 cards into a RAID mirror for fail-safe booting from them, for example, a hypervisor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7a/da4/e68/c7ada4e68b084819bd3bfb375891153b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e4/147/f8d/5e4147f8df6a47468bf92b767db134a9.jpg"><br><br>  On the back of the ProLiant DL60 are two Gigabit Ethernet ports, one of which, along with traditional network functions, also plays the role of an HP iLO management port. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f3/b4d/d04/0f3b4dd0410246098be3fd9cd0a40b32.jpg"><br><br>  The older HP ProLiant DL80 Gen9 model in a 2U package offers better I / O scalability and higher storage subsystem capacity.  The total disk capacity of this server can reach 72 TB against 24 TB in the model DL60.  Thus, in addition to the basic operations of the IT infrastructure, this server is suitable for applications demanding storage capacity, for example, for long-term storage or redundancy, since it has a reasonable price per gigabyte and a large disk system capacity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc1/57f/aac/dc157faac49e4ab683e460ad81195d4b.jpg"><br><br>  The DL80 has two chassis options: with support for eight or 12 SAS / SATA / SSD drives.  In the chassis with eight disks, you can later install a basket for four additional disks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/451/4f8/636/4514f863644a47e3a2cbd498f7592a72.jpg"><br><br>  Thus, this scalable server can carry on board 4 or 8 LFF form factor drives, which are not hot-swappable, or 8 or 12 hot-swap HDD or SSD LFF drives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/249/1fb/1de/2491fb1de5f74cbc99c4b90ea69e9e43.jpg"><br><br>  The tag retrieved from the slot allows you to quickly obtain information about the server's serial number, reference code, and iLO credentials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/202/633/176/2026331768424252bd98ef8c8440b55e.jpg"><br><br>  Like the HP ProLiant DL60, the DLL80 Gen9 model can be equipped with two 12-core Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processors with a clock frequency of up to 3 GHz, but it has more expansion options: the server provides six PCIe 3.0 slots instead of three.  Another difference from the DL60 is the ability to install a graphic coprocessor (GPU). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/607/b35/71f/607b3571f62945a9ae6f2e5d40668ecb.jpg"><br><br>  Transparent plastic dividers inside the case direct the air flow and allow you to see the system components without obstructing the view. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9de/f3c/88d/9def3c88db3749eda33018a7daaeec66.jpg"><br><br>  This plastic construction is easily removed, opening access to the inside of the server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c3/7ac/21b/7c37ac21bcfb4672a23a3b63f726ea45.jpg"><br><br>  Fans are also replaced in hot mode (optional).  Up to six fan modules provide sufficient cooling reserve for the hottest DL80 configurations.  ProLiant Gen9 DL60 and DL80 servers withstand operation at an ambient temperature of 40 ¬∞ C and humidity up to 80% (ASHRAE A3 standard), but there are limitations for certain configurations.  Such undemanding to the external environment can significantly save on climate equipment in the server and extend the normal service life of the server in case of a cooling system failure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/890/411/6c6/8904116c6946430896d04c67992713cf.jpg"><br><br>  As in the DL60, the processor mounting system ensures its secure fit and allows you to replace the processor without tools. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/200/771/1b0/2007711b0ac64d6ca9ab94cbc7819bed.jpg"><br><br>  The capacity of the server's RAM is also up to 256 GB - up to eight HP DDR4 Smart Memory DIMM modules operating with a clock frequency of up to 2133 MHz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e98/372/921/e9837292188a4b4a9550a898b3e38b20.jpg"><br><br>  For maximum data protection, performance and availability, the server can be equipped with an HP Smart Array P440 or P840 RAID Controller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/198/cbb/9a6/198cbb9a67fb466faa5a214098590874.jpg"><br><br>  As with the DL60, the HP Smart Storage Battery protects the data on the disk array controller cache during a power failure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/376/1d8/210/3761d82105b149ce80630d3e3a1901c9.jpg"><br><br>  Support for up to six PCIe 3.0 expansion slots allows you to install one standard-sized graphics card, network cards, or other devices as chosen by the customer, which increases the I / O bandwidth and provides the necessary scaling.  Easy access to PCIe 3.0 slots simplifies system maintenance and allows you to expand its configuration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa9/827/9bc/fa98279bc1b84474b721aaab10f2f87f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06f/591/d86/06f591d86694406f8a828804b565985c.jpg"><br><br>  HP's 80 PLUS Gold standby power supplies provide up to 92% efficiency, which, combined with HP power management features, helps reduce power consumption and running costs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/609/6a9/373/6096a937341d42a4ab1558e5392603ac.jpg"><br><br>  Like the DL60 model, the DL80 server has two Ethernet ports, three USB 3.0, one USB 2.0, a video port and a microSD slot.  There is also no dedicated iLO port here - iLO traffic goes through the first network port of the integrated network adapter.  The microSD memory card can be used to load hypervisors and some types of operating systems. <br><br>  Both models are available as standard 2 x 1GbE with a wide selection of HP FlexibleLOM adapters.  This allows you to achieve flexibility throughput channel, allows you to quickly respond to changing business requirements. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">findings</font> </h2><br>  HP ProLiant DL60 and DL80 are servers with a very attractive price-performance ratio, which will be a good choice for organizations with a limited budget, and flexible management functions make them a suitable solution for both providers and SMB.  The expandable configuration of the DL80 can meet the needs of growing companies.  In general, the servers of this series are well suited for the role of a domain controller, mail, file or backup server. <br><br>  However, their role is not limited to this.  HP ProLiant DL60 and DL80 servers allow you to create various infrastructure solutions for data centers, offer features that simplify management, monitoring of IT infrastructure, its deployment.  System developers have thought through the issues of power supply, cooling, cable management and access to components.  Through the use of full-fledged server processors, full support for virtualization is available. <br><br>  The use of the latest developments in the field of microarchitecture and power supply units 80 PLUS Gold in the servers contributes to obtaining high energy efficiency, compactness and reliability of systems.  Availability of warranty and manufacturer support saves the company from possible problems at the stage of implementation and operation.  And with HP iLO‚Äôs built-in management tools, you can remotely deploy, monitor and maintain servers. <br><br>  According <a href="http://www8.hp.com/h20195/V2/getpdf.aspx/4AA5-4454ENW.pdf%3Fver%3D3.0">to HP</a> , in general, compared to the previous generation, the new Gen9 servers have three times better performance per watt, up to 62% lower total cost of ownership (TCO) per three years, including the acquisition cost.  However, it should be noted that the DL60 / DL80 had no predecessors in the Gen8 generation - in the ProLiant lineup, these are new models. <br><br>  The key principles of the HP server architecture are the availability of systems in a software-configured, cloud-based environment, as part of converged infrastructures and optimization for specific workloads.  This is achieved, in many ways, with the ability to manage servers using the open REST API (read about this in one of our next posts). <br><br>  However, perhaps the most important thing about ProLiant servers with their 19-year history is the design of new generation systems using the <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/servers/management/index.html">latest management tools</a> that simplify work with the IT environment, which is becoming more and more complex, and at the same time providing skilled professionals with very wide functionality.  The DL60 / DL80 comes standard with a variety of free management tools: HP iLO 4, HP OneView Standard, Intelligent Provisioning, HP Insight Online, HP SUM, HP RESTful Interface Tool.  The options offered are HP ILO Essentials, HP iLO Advanced, HP Insight Control, HP OneView Advanced.  Please note that now when you buy a new DL60 / 80 server (the list of partner numbers is limited), you can get an iLO Essentials license for free! <br><br>  Using HP iLO's built-in management tools, you can remotely deploy, monitor, and maintain a server.  HP Smart Update, consisting of HP Smart Update Manager (HP SUM) and ProLiant Service Pack (SPP), helps optimize firmware and driver updates as well as reduce downtime. <br><br>  HP OneView Standard - the successor of the HP SIM tool - allows you to monitor and inventory almost all data center components in a very fast and convenient interface.  The tool is downloaded for free from the HP website. <br><br>  HP Insight Online is a real-time, personalized dashboard for monitoring your HP IT infrastructure.  On a simple web portal, you can monitor your equipment, post and monitor service cases for it, and manage available technical support. <br><br>  With the advent of the Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processor family, many vendors have begun to release server platforms that take advantage of the increased performance of the new Xeon architecture.  The DL60 / DL80 Gen9 is a new 1U / 2U form factor in the HP ProLiant family, and in addition to the new E5-2600 v3 processors and DDR4 memory, reflect HP's technological advances and the company's general vision of the most popular servers for a wide range of tasks. <br><br>  Our previous posts: <br><br>  <font color="#0096d6">¬ª</font> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/255915/">HP OpenStack Helion - First Meet</a> <br>  <font color="#0096d6">¬ª</font> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/255363/">SDN: alternative or addition to traditional networks?</a> <br>  <font color="#0096d6">¬ª</font> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/254645/">New network architectures: open or closed solutions?</a> <br>  <font color="#0096d6">¬ª</font> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/252857/">Implementing MSA in a virtualized enterprise environment</a> <br>  <font color="#0096d6">¬ª</font> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/252149/">HP MSA Disk Arrays as a Basis for Data Consolidation</a> <br>  <font color="#0096d6">¬ª</font> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/251567/">Multivendor corporate network: myths and reality</a> <br>  <font color="#0096d6">¬ª</font> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/249913/">Available HP ProLiant server models (10 and 100 series)</a> <br>  <font color="#0096d6">¬ª</font> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/251023/">Convergence based on HP Networking.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/251023/">Part 1</a> <br>  <font color="#0096d6">¬ª</font> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/248047/">HP ProLiant ML350 Gen9 - server with insane extensibility</a> <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/256253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/256253/</a></p>
