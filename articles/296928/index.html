      <b>First,</b> one should still take into account the fact that a computer can never create creatives for a specific target audience, based on many factors, ranging from analytics of the effectiveness of advertising channels, taking into account the current most relevant trends, ending with a community mood, which is all same never be discounted.  After all, this is a fundamental step in the formation of the brand strategy and its positioning with proper marketing. <br><br>  <b>Secondly,</b> each display of advertising is so unique that prices are set depending on a large number of metrics (indicators).  And that is why the RTB market cannot be fully compared and carry out a comprehensive analogy with all the same exchanges.  Here an extremely important role is played by a certain expert, an expert who can optimize an advertising campaign at the moments of greatest need in order to achieve maximum efficiency and pay back the client‚Äôs investment in advertising.  After all, it is in this way that client expenses are the most rational. <br><br>  <b>Third,</b> we use machines to process huge amounts of data.  But, one way or another, only one algorithm, uncontrolled by a competent specialist, will not be able to cope with a competent interpretation of data.  Machines will never be able to successfully predict a person‚Äôs behavior, understand his thoughts and the intended reaction.  A person, precisely because of his analytical skills, can take concrete actions and effective decisions to improve interaction with the consumer. <br><br>  Together with the development of media buying, specialists should grow and develop professionally who can effectively use algorithms and automation to achieve the best results and indicators.  Any industry will always need professionals who keep up with the times. <br><br>  Of course, the processes that were previously performed manually, automated, sooner or later.  Therefore, automation will affect a small part of media buying participants, those involved in the specific purchase of advertising traffic.  However, also, as well as workers of factories changed machines at a certain stage of development. <br><br>  However, no one bothers the marketer to retrain into a specialist who is able to competently manage the technology that supposedly came to replace us.  The same machines will not be able to work independently, without competent managing operator.  As for advertising specialists, there should be a huge number of settings for determining the exact targeting in order to ultimately fulfill the key KPI indicators of the advertising campaign.  That is, such a specialist will eventually have a software mindset. <br><br>  Software thinking is a mathematical, and at the same time, creative approach to decision making.  Let us designate what skills a specialist should possess with the above-described thinking: <br><br><ul><li>  high level of knowledge of the advertising ecosystem as a whole, and of each component-participant of this system in particular, and their direct interaction. </li><li>  deep understanding of consumer psychology: how and why Central Asia responds to different types of advertising and why you should choose this particular tool in favor of one or the other. </li><li>  combining mathematical (media planning, forecasting the progress of an advertising campaign and its performance) and creative (ideas for creatives, the need for the brand to remain in trend) skills. </li><li>  analytical thinking, the ability to quickly work with numbers and actually processed data files. </li><li>  knowledge of two or three main areas with a wide and in-depth knowledge set in the above. </li><li>  adaptability, willingness to learn and feel comfortable in an interdisciplinary role. </li></ul><br><br>  <i><b>Tomorrow's success of advertising professionals is 60% of science, and 40% of art.</b></i>  <i><b>A person may not be a professional designer, but is obliged to know mathematics like the back of his hand, otherwise, these will not be the professionals who are waiting for a bright and bright future.</b></i>  <i><b>And the future is still in software thinking.</b></i> <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296928/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296928/</a></p>
