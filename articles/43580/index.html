  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Program article: religious wars</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is such entertainment in the network - to organize religious wars.  Many people think the '600th Mercedes is cool', but very few people drove it.  Just once someone said that cool, and that's all.  And if someone says that BMW has released an excellent model, they will protest in every possible way, so simply adamantly protest. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is a childish peculiarity (with age it should disappear, but not always) of any person - associate itself with the products and companies that he uses.  And worse than that, he does not use, but he was told that it is - super. <br>  (Everything that is written below does not refer to absolutely everyone, but to a very significant proportion of people) <br>  And now people begin to break spears and for hours to excel in stinging remarks, sarcasm or simply in personal insults.  But in the heat of swearing, somehow everyone forgets that their interlocutor may well be a wonderful person, and that they should think over their words, and not rush into stereotypes and unreasonable arguments. <br>  There are a number of products and companies that often cause such disputes.  From the cursory list (everyone can easily fill it in the comments): <br>  - google <br>  -Microsoft <br>  -Apple <br>  Linux <br>  Firefox <br>  -Opera <br>  At the same time, many do not try to think with their heads that behind all this there are thousands of real employees of companies that make different products, completely different in quality and so on.  Without going into details at all, a person reacts to keywords from the above list like a bull on a red rag.  And foaming at the mouth begins to argue that this is cool or vice versa is an abomination.  At the same time, he often didn‚Äôt see the subject of dispute in his eyes, but he didn‚Äôt even read a couple of reviews with different opinions from different sources.  It is not worth mentioning that everyone has different tastes-habits-needs.  Why waste your brain effort, where it‚Äôs easier to label people that they didn‚Äôt even think up themselves, but once someone else (for example, a cool chat companion with the nickname 'YaVs3ZnAuLu4weVsEx') was stuck in his head. <br>  If you express your opinion, first build it yourself.  Stand out from the gray crowd, and do not repeat the same thing as a parrot.  When you hear "small-scale can release only sucks" or "Google is going to enslave our brain next year" or "there is nothing better than Linux for a home computer," then there is a great suspicion that the author of the replica is a narrow-minded person.  Please remember that any company simply does business and earns money, there is nothing more to expect from it;  and that in this company there are mostly good and qualified employees who still try;  and that everyone gets both bad and good products;  that each product has its own audience. <br>  Learn to think for yourself - this is really rare. </div>
