      Yesterday, at 1:00 pm Moscow time, without making any claims to alternative customer users, without warning, AOL struck our multi-million dollar community by completely blocking access to many operating systems and denying support to our favorite customers - QIP, QIP Infium, &amp; RQ , Miranda and all the rest.  Mobile users Jimm, numerous owners of computers with pre-installed licensed Linux and MacOS, are completely isolated from ICQ. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This unheard-of attack on our community is a treachery unprecedented in the history of the civilized Internet.  The disconnection of alternative customers was made despite the fact that agreements were signed between AOL and a number of companies in Russia and Ukraine on the mutually beneficial promotion of services and many users downloaded and used branded customers with genuine interest.  The disconnection was made despite the fact that the majority of users in the past fully held onto ICQ 2000 and 2003 Pro while they were working, and AOL could not make them any complaints about the fulfillment of the license agreement.  In addition, the disconnection was made with discrimination based on geography, only our countries, all the CIS countries are affected.  All responsibility for this spit on millions of users entirely falls on the corporation AOL. <br><br>  Already after the shutdown of AOL's bot with Uin 1, I, as a QIP user, made a statement on behalf of their owners that AOL Corporation decided to disable alternative customers due to the fall in their advertising revenues. <br><br>  In response to this, on behalf of all the victims of AOL's actions, I stated that until the last minute AOL Corporation did not implement any of the functions requested by QIP users and other clients and exercised by their developers, despite repeated discussion of these functions in the official ICQ forums, and that by doing so the AOL corporation is the attacker.  The aforementioned AOL representative with Win 1 refused to even accept this message, clearly showing his attitude to listening to user requests. <br><br>  Now that the attack on the Russian-speaking ICQ user community has already taken place, the only way out for us is to get together again using other means of communication and above all Jabber, and punish the AOL corporation with a byte, a word and a dollar. <br><br>  This war is not imposed on us by the developers of ICQ, not by ordinary employees and AOL users, whose problems are due to the company's corporate policy, we understand well, but by the clique of the bloodthirsty bourgeois who enslaved Mirabilis and Netscape, who were involved in scandals with the disclosure of confidential search data and monopolized the Internet market -providing in a number of regions, bounding corporate policy with many talented programmers and designers. <br><br>  The free software community expresses the unshakable confidence that our valiant programmers and hackers and brave representatives of the anonymous underground will fulfill their duties with honor to the program that allowed them to find friends and relatives, and send the aggressor corporation to the dustbin of history. <br><br>  Not the first time our community has to deal with attacking arrogant enemy.  At one time, on the campaign of SUP against LJ, our people responded with a boycott on March 21, and the SUP was defeated and had to give the reins to Lebedev.  The same will happen with the conceited AOL, who announced a new campaign against our network.  Active Open Source and all our people will once again lead a victorious campaign for the opportunity to communicate, for openness, for freedom. <br><br>  Jabber-movement expresses a firm belief that all users of our ICQ, all Quipers, Miranders and Rats, Linux and Vinduzyatniki, five-, six-, seven-, eight- and nine-decadolders will react with due consciousness to their capabilities, to their work .  All our community should now be united and united as never before.  Each of us must register on our own and help others register on the Jabber server, study work methods and explain them to less advanced associates, contact their contact list users in any way possible and help them reconnect using really free resources to ensure all business needs. , friendly and personal communication, to bring the community back to prosperity, and AOL to bankruptcy and multi-billion dollar debts. <br><br>  The movement calls you, users and users of ICQ, even more closely to rally their ranks around the glorious principles of Open Source, around the free Jabber protocol, around the Jabber.ru server.  Our cause is right.  AOL will be broken.  Victory will be ours. <br><br>  Glory to the alternative, death AOL! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49818/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49818/</a></p>
