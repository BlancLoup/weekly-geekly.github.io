  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Protect your phone yourself</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  That stumbled today in the RSS on such <a href="http://www.osp.ru/news/2008/0814/5323517/">an article</a> . <br>  I would have just squandered it if it hadn't been for one thing: ~ 2 months ago, my favorite HTC was very professional for me.  Naturally, Simka was immediately thrown away - after 15 minutes my phone was ‚Äúturned off or out of network coverage‚Äù.  Conversations with the mobile operator (in this case, MTS) did not yield any results.  They cannot provide any data, etc.  etc.  The only thing they can is to block the SIM card and issue a new one.  Moreover, information about the serial number of the phone they, of course, stored.  And if they wanted, they could do everything, for example, in Spain or Australia. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Here is an excerpt from one of the sites: <br><br>  <i>But not everything is so bad and hopeless, this is evidenced by the experience of other countries.</i>  <i>So, in Spain, in order to block a stolen or lost ‚Äúhandset‚Äù, its rightful owner only needs to call the operator and report the 15-digit identification number of the device.</i>  <i>In France and Australia, there is a single register of all stolen numbers, and any mobile operator is obliged to immediately block the device, which is listed in the "black list".</i>  <i>In Holland, cell phone companies send a message ‚ÄúThis phone is stolen‚Äù to the stolen phones (they are identified by the IMEI number) every 3 minutes.</i>  <i>In Russia, attempts are being made to compile lists of stolen phones, but only on the Internet.</i>  <i>Such a registry exists in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg, where any victim can ‚Äúput on the phone‚Äù a telephone if he has the necessary documents.</i>  <i>In addition, for the "flashing" IMEI abroad provides for severe punishment.</i>  <i>In Australia, for such "art" give 2 years of imprisonment, in the UK - 5 years.</i>

      Apparently, there is a registry, but nobody wants to use it and it is very problematic to find it.  Again give an excerpt: <br><br>  <i>As told by CNews at MegaFon, the company fully supports the proposal of the Central Internal Affairs Directorate.</i>  <i>‚ÄúMoreover, we have already tried to maintain the database of identification numbers in some regions, but these measures did not bring tangible success, because other operators were not involved in the process,‚Äù added the company.</i>  <i>MegaFon also notes that this is a very useful measure, but more procedural issues need to be resolved (for example, how the guards will be alerted if a stolen phone is detected).</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Unlike the two previous companies, MTS has not yet donetsa defined its attitude to the initiative of the Main Internal Affairs Directorate.</i>  <i>‚ÄúFirst you need to look at the statistics on phone thefts and compare it with similar documents for other types of goods,‚Äù told Mew.</i>  <i>‚ÄúPerhaps such a large-scale campaign would simply be inexpedient: in particular, it may be more useful to look for hijacked cars.‚Äù</i>  <i>In general, we believe that the search for stolen phones should be approached in a comprehensive and cautious manner, since consumer rights violations are possible. ‚Äù</i>  <i>In addition, the MTS indicated that the project was incomplete.</i>  <i>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not clear how the registry will look like, but now it‚Äôs clear that this is a very expensive IT project that someone has to pay for.</i>  <i>Operators should not do this because we do not have a direct relationship with the registry, ‚Äùadded the company.</i> <br><br>  Summarizing, we can say that the theft of your phone is your problem.  Despite a lot of advice about the need to go to the police with a statement about the theft of a mobile phone, the result of disclosing such cases is, frankly, deplorable, especially for large cities. <br>  Well, what I wrote all this for ‚Äî perhaps 720 (then 432) rubles is not such a large amount, for which you can give an opportunity to thieves to profit at your expense.  Sorry at the time I did not think about this issue. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37077/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37077/</a></p>
