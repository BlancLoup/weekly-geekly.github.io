However, it is possible to influence the situation - to allow the crowd to rely not only on their assessments.  And on whose other estimates can you rely?  On expert, first of all.  You can still make a bet on the ratings of fake reviews - but the method is so-so!  What else?  Answer it yourself. <br><br>  And I will consider the situation when the certification service can act as an expert, and only from those who actually bought, and those who have worked a little for the benefit of both parties, as customer reviews. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The sign of trust is a thing known from antiquity, and in online commerce, since the 90s.  The most popular service of trust marks is Trustedshops.  About 10 thousand stores participate in it on strictly commercial terms.  In different countries, its popularity is different, most of all - in Germany, but everywhere small business is involved - an online store of lamps, an online store of cranes ... <br>  10 thousand shop owners can not be wrong?  Well, then, the main route means not the creation of associations and public councils relevant during a period of social change, but the development of a business model and technology.  Well, or copying them, which is even better for Russian business.  Trustedshops has threatened to enter the Russian market since 2005, but if they are still not here, let's do the civilization of the market ourselves.

      Certification must first of all weed out any leftist.  Certification criteria, their number depends on the corrosiveness and integrity of the certifiers, and vary from country to country: in trustedshops - 70 criteria, in the ‚ÄúReliable purchase‚Äù (this is already in Russia) - 110. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f55/446/c20/f55446c20c2bc95e0a93e3ae625a1647.png" title="Secure Purchase Certification Guide" alt="   "><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3aa/f26/808/3aaf26808c07818a7391de0b8be80506.png" title="Secure Purchase Certification Guide" alt="   "><br><br>  In June, as a freelancer, I wrote all the texts for the future site of ‚ÄúSecure Purchase,‚Äù which officially opened a month ago.  I had a whole summer to calmly think about what is now being discussed with unnecessary fervor in the FB and in the Circe. <br><br>  According to Symantec, the presence of an Extended Validation SSL Certificate on the site, when browsers display a green address bar with the name of the company, significantly increases the conversion.  According to the Trustedshops, the presence of their mark on the pages increases the conversion (the recorded German record - by 40%).  According to NADT (of past years), its icon (logo) increased conversion by an average of 3-4% (record - 20%).  According to A / B-testing of online stores ShopTime.ru and KupiVIP, the appearance of the ‚Äú <a href="http://www.trustedservice.ru/">Reliable purchase</a> ‚Äù widget on the pages increases the conversion by 12.3% and 8%, respectively.  Other publicly announced studies of this mark have not yet been. <br><br>  The growth of conversion is the main argument for setting up a widget.  But specifically ‚ÄúReliable purchase‚Äù is a service with nuances and with buns. <br><br>  In general, trust in online commerce is a topic with nuances.  See, the online store from Orenburg was re-registered as Moscow.  It trades the same, from the same place, but after the Moscow registration the sales went up.  Has trust grown?  It may have grown, but this is not the first version that comes to mind.  Since the search is now going on in Moscow and the region, there are more passages, more visitors, sales are growing.  But the director will not forget this experience. <br><br>  The trust service has a similar approach - check the sign and think about the result.  Usually do not enter into a contract for a year or even half a year.  They say, take our subscription for two months, put Visual WebSite Optimizer or similar free product from Google, test. <br>  The director will not forget the fact of turnover growth, and we will see what conclusions will be made. <br>  If you do not want to test, then, say, use our turnover growth calculator.  It was designed for the site, but for some reason it is being sent to Excel ... <br><br>  In general, the concept can be described as follows.  The online store, which has given its consent, is checked by the <a href="http://trustedservice.ru/criteria">criteria</a> , if successful, it is given the <a href="http://trustedservice.ru/owner/sign">widget</a> code, having seen that buyers start to refuse less often the goods that they brought into their Recycle Bins, surely pay for them, increasing the conversion.  However, to be more precise, the widget is given only after a successful test purchase, the results of which are printed on the site <a href="http://www.imobzor.ru/">Imobzor</a> , a popular site with reviews of online buyers. <br><br>  Reliable Shopping Buns: <br>  - publication of the test purchase report ( <a href="http://www.imobzor.ru/kontrolnaya-zakupka/sumochka-com">example</a> ) and getting into the imobzor catalog.  There - 40-80 thousand visits per month (depending on the season and current updates of search engines). <br><br>  - mailing in the press and at its base, a reason to remind myself: loyalty and / or PR. <br>  The press does not particularly like such news, but no one had any publications.  Moreover, it all depends on the PR people: shoppinglive.ru won the certificate on the certificate. <br><br>  - you can print and put the certificate in the boxes, you can place a small icon near the "Buy" button, as some do with the Norton sign of antivirus. <br><br>  Then on the widget "reliable purchase" will appear yellow stars rating of buyers.  Foursome will be many.  You can go to reviews on this widget if you are a potential buyer.  For owners, they will be in the Dashboard. <br><br>  The main thing is that the eKomi model was used to collect customer feedback only from those who actually bought it.  According to this technology, in the letter about the shipment of goods to the buyer, there comes a link by which he can evaluate the seller‚Äôs service.  And he is asked to rate the service and write a review, even if he liked everything. <br><br>  If a negative review arrives, it will not be published for five days.  During this period, the service informs the store about the problem and waits for the store to settle the matter without publishing negative evaluations. <br><br>  Purchased reviews in this scheme is unlikely to climb through.  Reviews that are written by evil losers, if they still get, but much less proportionally than on J.Market.  This service is provided in the tariff "Professional". <br><br>  There is ShopTime.ru, a relatively new store that needs to be trusted.  Back in May, certified.  In the last week of May, I conducted A / B testing.  Got a conversion boost for the option with a sign on the page.  In June, I sent a newsletter about certification to my customer base - to stimulate loyalty.  I managed to write a review about the service.  I sent a press release about my certification.  I tried to put the certificate inside the package.  And all this is still at the stage of the alpha version of the service.  Until now, no other store has done such a journey.  Maybe in vain? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/318/a4d/0bc/318a4d0bce8402e7e429c81650bfc375.jpg" alt="Certificate of safe purchase in the box with the goods"><br><br>  Well, and finally, infographics (of course, I‚Äôm a designer from the word ‚Äúbad‚Äù, but if you open the picture in full size by clicking ‚Äúmouse‚Äù, you can use it). <br><br>  I hope everyone understands: research in our e-commerce is always of an evaluative nature (there is not a single large customer able to invest in this study).  ‚ÄúEvaluative = easily criticized,‚Äù said the head of NADT.  The estimates given here are no exception.  They are not here for critical discussion.  To illustrate one (my) hypothesis. <br><br>  We took a focus group of 24 people (9 of them are men) - only those who are completely on the Internet.  In fact, they work in it, only under the conditions of selection - not in marketing.  After choosing the answers, trust has taken the last place - like, we'll figure it out, not small ones. <br><br>  At the same time put the same poll, but without free answers, on Imobzor. <br><br>  As you know, there are no online focus groups.  But visitors to this site almost all come from the search: the most part on requests like "reviews on boutique.ru", a smaller part on requests like "reviews on online stores."  But they didn‚Äôt ask about the reviews at that time, but gave a list of answers, among which the sign of trust was among the first.  Voted as pretty.  Prices, of course, won, but not by much. <br><br>  Signs of trust, other external signs of reliability play a large role if they remind of themselves.  So I allow myself to interpret the result. <br><br>  The third part of the infographic tells about how I came to the Atrium, a shopping center to which people come specifically for shopping and where the conversion is 50-70%, and began to ask, and also buy on the Internet, and read reviews?  The number of affirmative answers to these questions threatened to turn the result into an unreliable looking ... <br><br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6605/16370975.7/0_678e3_24b58518_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/358/28e/6f9/35828e6f9bd25d32d9d7de8defe0f96d.jpg" width="510" height="1024" title="Infographics" alt=":  -  ?"></a> <br>  <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/machomachomacho/view/424163/">Look at Yandex.

Because there is something to talk about, right? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149755/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149755/</a></p>
