Well, of course, there are methods - ‚Äúquick‚Äù actions, recording, delegating and planning the rest - from the practice of which there is a benefit.  This is if you look methodically.  From the practical point of view, it turns out that the heterogeneity of the automation tools of the daily GTD process requires no less effort than the effort to study the technology itself. <br><br>  Here is the story of the real GTD implementation in my life.  Immediately I warn you - there is no advertising here, I am not engaged with any project or technology.  I'm just an inquisitive and rational person.  I do not like to waste time bored and wasted, to put it more simply.  I would be very happy if your time is spent on this post, if not in vain, then at least it will be filled with interest. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As for me, the GTD toolbox is hopelessly outdated.  Take the ideal desktop of the apologist GTD - trays, stickers in the daddy-binder, some flows of incoming-delegated-planned cases.  We reject.  We have almost all sources of problems - electronic.  What see daddies and binders?  Computer, communicator, Internet clouds - that's our everything.  No, well, on paper, it also works.  Just for me personally, the orthodox version of the tool does not fit ...

      A more realistic option: mail + service / program GTD + regular stuffing and browsing there everything that appears in the brain region and qualifies as a task to perform.  Usually this technology dies in the daily routine immediately after the accuracy of recording encounters the awareness of the obvious loss of time for this business.  I have had it several times until I realized that I needed to cope with this matter in a couple of clicks. <br><br>  <i>Lyrical digression number 0.</i>  <i>Of course, I am not so clever and spied on the topic.</i>  <i>And here, on Habr√©.</i>  <i>I cannot find it now, but I met once in the comments on the work of a certain Vasya Sour (a green website on narod.ru is googling - this is it).</i>  <i>I took the version that human (and not literary) language.</i>  <i>Read it.</i>  <i>I read it again.</i>  <i>And three more times - within a couple of months.</i>  <i>Then it came to me that I was doing wrong.</i> <br><br>  Experience shows that just clicks are not enough.  After all, to click, you need to be at the computer + to have an object - a recorded task.  Then you attach the context, categories, terms, etc. to it.  But my job is such that I do not always have a computer.  That on the meeting, then call.  In general, the tasks do not always appear right on the computer and here comes the problem: todo logging. <br><br>  What kind of channels do I process?  At work, this is Outlook, Gmail is for personal correspondence, but there are also affairs there, and all sorts of SMS messages, chat rooms in Gtalk, phone calls (desktop and mobile), meeting notes and personal thoughts.  Such a variety dictates life itself and use only the program GTD becomes unrealistic. <br><br>  <i>Lyrical digression number 1.</i>  <i>In fact, to date, any services and programs GTD automate the most "loaded" channel - mail (well, all sorts of online things - chat rooms, discussions).</i>  <i>And if you have crumpled paper in your hands - digitize, be kind.</i>  <i>This is understandable: the other channels already require other efforts to promote the technology.</i>  <i>A message once - and beautifully wrap in the tags, but you commit to the project.</i>  <i>But we live in Roissy, in which only the most understandable (read - ‚Äúarchaic‚Äù) management methods / tools are perfected.</i>  <i>And not mobile online collaborative groups from the "flat world" of Friedman, sitting in some wedoist or basecamp thread around the clock.</i> <br><br>  I decided that the most optimal thing is to fix the ‚Äúincoming‚Äù ones in the communicator in the ‚Äúwhat is this -&gt;‚Äù task?  -&gt; write "and then on the computer to understand.  Anyway, without a mobile phone from a computer, I do not move away.  Problem: how to transfer recordings (and their statuses) from a communicator to a computer (and back) with minimal effort?  Why I set ‚Äústatuses‚Äù - because tasks are not only recorded on the go, but also solved.  For example, it was necessary to "talk to Ivanov": went - talked - done.  Need to tag.  And so that on return in the main list of undone cases, this task was no longer there. <br><br>  <i>Lyrical digression number 2.</i>  <i>In general, no matter how perverted the todo-softin authors are for phones - the size (of the screen) matters.</i>  <i>I found that it is convenient to do three things on the communicator: 1) write text 2-3 words long, 2) mark completed cases and 3) view the to-do list ‚Äúon the go‚Äù.</i>  <i>No planning, tagging and other GTD activity on the phone can be made COMFORTABLE.</i>  <i>Although somehow you can do it, I do not argue ...</i> <br><br>  By itself, synchronization of task lists between communicators and computers is a simple matter.  I downloaded a client for my OS in my phone, hooked on an online service, pushed tasks there, connected the service to Outlook on my computer and that's it.  Problems begin in the planning phase, terminologically, in creating a chain of tasks in ‚Äúrevolving‚Äù projects.  If it is very simple: when creating nested to-do lists. <br><br>  <i>Lyrical digression number 3.</i>  <i>As a "task book" Outlook - shit.</i>  <i>There everything is sharpened by a flat single-level to-do list.</i>  <i>Categories and views with perversions do not save.</i>  <i>Either the program is sharpened to simplify life or it hurts you - there is no third option.</i>  <i>In general, in Outlook, the todo list on the side blushes with overdue statuses as quickly as it looks more like an expanded list of nested cases.</i>  <i>Because all the bells and whistles either force you to create a separate view, or the result does not fit the height of any monitor.</i>  <i>Conclusion: in Outlook, tasks should be flagged and pushed somewhere outside where they can be handled more easily.</i>  <i>But here, all is not well.</i> <br><br>  Task sources from Outlook itself (in 99% of letters this is) it is very convenient to mark the priority checkbox and assign a category to them, but they are NOT SYNCHRONIZED with any service or GTD program, since  are not TASKS.  Of course, you can get out: 1) send mail to gmail, 2) read the letter, create a task, drop a letter there or 3) make a macro ‚Äúturn the letter into a task‚Äù and press Ctrl + Shift + number (I made a macro).  But you want to spend 1-2 seconds on placing the letter in the tasks and another couple of seconds (maximum) - on attaching the task to the context (in my case it means ‚Äústick it in the project‚Äù or ‚Äúlink it to a contact from the address book‚Äù).  How convenient to do this in Outlook - I did not find. <br><br>  In general, it is decided with the incoming flow: everything that is born out of the computer (and on the phone, including) is marked in the communicator, it pushes the current GPRS / Wifi list to the cloud service.  From there, picks up the updated lists on their own, on a regular basis.  There is no direct connection with the computer (by hose), and it is not necessary - the 21st century is in the courtyard.  DataOverTheAir. <br><br>  Mail in Outlook, as I said, turn the macro in the elements of type "task" and push into the same service.  On the PC there is a small agent who eats the Outlook task list and is able to synchronize them with the cloud. <br>  Half the battle is done: all incoming messages are recorded.  According to the method, they need to be somehow crammed in time, prioritized, put into projects / contexts, put all sorts of reminders and so on.  I don‚Äôt bother so much: I attach a contact, an event to a task and / or shove it into a project (in fact, the project is the word from which the names of all tasks begin - thanks Vasya Kislyi, suggested; it‚Äôs not so convenient with contacts, although he advises to assign the name of the counterparty in the name of the task, not joining it with the address book card). <br><br>  <i>Lyrical digression number 4.</i>  <i>Online GTD - shit, because without an Internet you can‚Äôt do anything.</i>  <i>GTD software is better because of its autonomy, but I don‚Äôt see them hanging on the cloud and synchronizing with all popular programs for recording ‚Äúincoming‚Äù without problems.</i>  <i>Either the cloud is cool, but the customer is shameful, or vice versa.</i> <br><br>  So, it's time to write about the iPad;) More precisely, you can voice the ‚Äúiron‚Äù DANO: communicator - Nexus One.  At work - Outlook.  Homes - iMac and iPad.  And, also, for the sake of completeness, I‚Äôll share a resource comment: about $ 120 was burned in the search for a solution and a month and a half a time.  Yes, I'm stubborn. <br><br>  NEEDED: <br>  - on the phone from the Android todo-client, do the following: look in the widget, see the list (with subtasks), ‚Äúexecute‚Äù any item from it, add tasks, synchronize the result with the main list; <br>  - in Outlook, too, to collect cases, synchronize them with the cloud, but do not plan (well, it is inconvenient, well, now), but only to view and mark the execution; <br>  - at home, thoughtfully review the tasks and plan the next day / week / month.  There is an iPad for this ‚Äúabdominal‚Äù job (why not an Android-tablet: they are still not accessible, so it's no worse than an iPad. Besides, the iPad's long-playing battery is terrible).  It‚Äôs usually not to sit at home behind a computer, because iMac is rarely used and not at work.  For example, as now - to write on Habr :) <br><br>  <i>Lyrical digression number 5.</i>  <i>In general, I would have a homogeneous (in the sense of the platform) kit (iPhone + iPad + iMac, N1 + Android tablet + do not care which computer) - this article would not exist.</i>  <i>But there is a "zoo".</i>  <i>Each device is interesting in its own way, historically the motive to buy was more exploratory than sharpened by GTD or something else.</i>  <i>But the fact remains: under iOS there are wonderful organizers for the tablet, they are the same, but clipped for the iPhone, but if you replace the phone with an Android based, there are almost no such.</i>  <i>‚ÄúAlmost‚Äù is literally a few.</i>  <i>If there were no cloud services, the set of iOS (tablet) and Android (communicator) programs with corrected connections to Outlook would probably not intersect.</i> <br><br>  Well, sobsno, now the DECISION is left, otherwise I have already exhausted everyone: <br><br>  1. Program on N1 - <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.lakeridge.DueToday%26feature%3Dsearch_result">DueToday</a> .  Writes some Irishman.  Almost unknown.  But best-best-best.  It‚Äôs a pity that you can‚Äôt read the phone‚Äôs address book for contacting tasks with contacts - there‚Äôs no price.  Although, to be honest, no program can do this (even the great Pocket Informant).  Or I looked bad. <br>  2. Cloud - <a href="http://www.toodledo.com/">toodledo.com</a> with a premium account.  Premium allows you to synchronize nested tasks (projects).  Well, there is something else, but I don‚Äôt need this ‚Äúmore‚Äù, since I can‚Äôt remember ... <br>  3. Outlook pushes tasks outward through a 3rd party tool for toodledo called <a href="http://www.chromadrake.com/ChromaticDragon/software/ToodledoSyncInfo.aspx">Chromatic Dragon</a> .  In general, there are only two of them in tudldu, but the second one is monstrous in functionality, spoils with Outlook macros and is paid, and quite. <br>  4. iPad - <a href="http://2doapp.com/en/2Do/features.html">2do</a> .  There are many options in the AppStore.  If I suddenly switch to mac for work, we'll see what I plan for.  So far, 2Do is like a program for communicating with toodledo and planning cases on the couch. <br><br>  Conclusions: yes there are no conclusions.  Planned article from todo cross out and go to bed.  And you discuss on health :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114084/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114084/</a></p>
