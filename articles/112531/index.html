  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Choosing a mass mailing service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr! <br><br>  In this topic, I would like to consider three services so that the reader can decide which one is more suitable for his business.  Despite the fact that two of the subjects are integrated marketing systems, I will focus only on the possibility of conducting mass mailings.  The candidates are the following services: <br><br> <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/bdaebdf5/2e12ccf2/5ff0cbc9/62f30630.png"></a> <a href="http://www.pardot.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/453f64f4/bfe80d8c/561074fe/af246c78.png"></a> <a href="http://www.webasyst.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b254bbb1/a7166e31/b97baaa1/14845d86.png"></a>

        </script>
      <br>
      Images are clickable. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  First impression </h1><br><h4>  Mailchimp </h4><br>  Excellent design in the best traditions of <a href="http://dribbble.com/">dribbbla</a> immediately gains confidence.  The menu provides basic information about the service, a couple of slides broadcast to us about the ‚Äúcharms‚Äù of Chimp, as well as several introductory and sufficiently high-quality videos tell us about the advantages of the service.  Immediately we are offered to try out the free version, which implies 1000 subscribers and 6000 shipments per month.  For the free version is quite good.  The first stage of registration takes only a few seconds, at the second we are forced to fill in the company information in detail.  With familiarity intents annoying, but not going anywhere.  We confirm registration via email and use. <br><br><h4>  Pardot </h4><br>  The design does not cause emotions.  Neither good nor bad.  Typical menu, demo, feature list.  The advantages of the free version are unknown.  We are registering for familiarization and ‚Äúbang!‚Äù Does not accept the gloomy mailbox.  Says, they say, enter the mailbox of your company.  I think that is stupid, but nothing can be done.  Confirmed registration via email, use.  As a maker-up, I could not help noticing the ‚Äújamb‚Äù of the plug-in when closing the video.  The page is stupidly updated instead of just hiding the video. <br><br><h4>  Webasyst </h4><br>  We go to the site and immediately see a la Lebedev <s>cretinism</s> creative, which personally does not really attract me, even hide it pushes.  Inspection page without video, a couple of pictures and a test, text, text.  Nothing downright knockdown.  What features the free version gives us is not clear.  Enough quick registration procedure.  We use. <br><br><h1>  Interface, usability and security </h1><br><h4>  Mailchimp </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/74d26619/c4620854/2913b151/6879a891.png"><br><br>  Beautiful and easy interface.  Minimum graphics, maximum css.  The response of the pages is extremely high even at low speed connection with the computer.  Text prompts and training videos are met at every step, and it doesn‚Äôt distract from working with the service at all.  Work is a pleasure.  The work of the service goes through the http protocol, therefore it is impossible to speak about the iron data security. <br><br><h4>  Pardot </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/479a4d76/26d7511b/82269da0/0ccd4e90.png"><br><br>  A conservative, slightly clumsy interface, which could not be more clear in nature.  Of the graphics - only the logo and some icons.  The service uses a secured connection.  Page response time at low Internet speeds sometimes causes sadness, as well as failures with a security certificate.  But I note that these problems were observed ONLY on slow connections. <br><br><h4>  Webasyst </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/80241346/1219e33a/41720a42/45ed05f5.png"><br><br>  Interface cap is too big.  For each section of the service provides the corresponding "fat" icon.  What for?  It is not clear.  In view of this, it‚Äôs already extremely inconvenient to work on a 15.6-inch notebook.  The interface design is not very different from the "muzzle" of the site, which is not very brightens the process of work.  The response of the pages is normal, the layout is a failure.  At low speeds, you can observe an uncollected horizontal menu - for a while it is smeared across the entire screen and looks vertical (this is just nagging a layout designer).  The connection, as in the case of Mailchimp, is unprotected. <br><br><h1>  Templates </h1><br><h4>  Mailchimp </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c16ee1fd/8aaf0210/ff1d4249/ba36e674.png"><br><br>  A large number of ready-made templates for mailings is an advantage, but I don‚Äôt undertake to say about their absolute cross-leveling (accurate mapping to all mail services / clients) because their styles are placed in the head of the document.  The work of the template editor is divided into three modes: code, combined and visual editing.  The classic visual editor is missing, while the built-in editor is based on its own service API.  This means that for a visual work, the template that is laid out on the local computer must be optimized for the service editor.  Of course, I may be mistaken, but I did not find file hosting for images that can be used in letters. <br><br><h4>  Pardot </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/787d0909/689642b4/ebedb249/a87d661d.jpg"><br><br>  In its toolbox, the service has a visual editing mode and a source code mode.  A plain text format is also provided for the letter, which is sent along with the original imposing one, which reduces the risk of the letter getting into spam.  Other services presented in the article cannot send additional plain text version.  I would like to note that the visual editor has the ability to rewrite the source code of the template in its own way, which can lead to terrible consequences, but if you make <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/css/112163/">these</a> recommendations during the layout of the template, then there will be no problems. <br><br>  The huge advantage of the service is that there is a toolkit for testing the template in many mail services / clients.  The test takes a few minutes, which is manna from heaven for the maker-up, and man-hours saved for the employer.  The service provides file hosting with a shortening of links for images. <br><br><h4>  Webasyst </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/018f0f92/5f6e4d97/d31e8da6/83359358.png"><br><br>  While Mailchimp and Pardot allow you to save mailing templates, in Webasyst you can only send an email, after which it will be saved in the outbox.  This outgoing message can later be used as a template.  We can say that the mail interface of the service is just a mailbox with an address book.  Perhaps for whom it seems more convenient, but I think this is a minus.  You can work with the template both in the mode of visual editing and with the source code.  The free version provides a file of 100 megabytes. <br><br><h1>  Price range </h1><br>  You can familiarize with concrete figures on sites of services (logos in the beginning of article are clickable), and I can only briefly summarize the cost. <br><br>  I still did not understand what restrictions Webasyst imposes on the free version (except for file hosting), and whether it is possible to buy only the mail service (or it comes only in the package with the store), but even with all this Mailchimp with all its charms seems to be a more tasty morsel for small businesses.  For middle and top managers more suitable Pardot. <br><br><h1>  Total </h1><br>  What can I say to summarize?  Webasyst lags behind almost all positions before competitors, although it is Russian-speaking.  Mailchimp is good and ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù even to a private person, and at the same time very flexible in price pricing.  Pardot will be an excellent tool for large companies, and among other things it has a number of other features that you can find on the service website.  If I missed any points, I will be happy to add in the comments.  Thank you for your attention and good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112531/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112531/</a></p>
