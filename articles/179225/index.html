    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Personal experience </h4><br>  In 2003, I graduated from a technical school with a degree in Computer Software and Automated Systems, that is, a programmer. <br><br>  After the joy of this event subsided a bit, I started looking for work.  Having bought the publication ‚ÄúWork and Salary‚Äù, I was annoyed to find that C, Pascal, Delphi programmers do not really need anyone, but I need 1c programmers.  At the same time, the salaries of these mysterious programmers "1C" offered 2-3 times higher than just "C" My thoughts were: "What is" C "I know, but what is 1C?" <br>  Further, I did not work in my specialty, later I got into Franchisee 1c and I firmly decided to become a 1c programmer, but I had no idea how to begin and how to approach this matter.  On the way to the goal, I shook hard, so I decided to write this article. <br><br><h4>  Where to begin </h4><br>  It is very easy to become a ‚Äú1C programmer‚Äù, especially if there is a desire, and a little time. <br><br>  I see two main ways, through Franchisee (1c company partners specializing in servicing program users.) Or self-study, working in a company that already has a 1c Enterprise program <br><br><h4>  Franchisee Way </h4><br>  It is necessary to get a job in Franchisee 1c for the position of ‚Äúservice engineer of ITS‚Äù, but not in small, it is necessary for the company to conduct employee training, and at least five to ten programmers in the state.  There are quite a few such companies; they are probably taking there all. <br>  To begin with, you will be offered to undergo training, training is usually paid by the employer at the minimum rate.  In 2006, it was the McDonald‚Äôs employee‚Äôs salary, so you won‚Äôt die of hunger.  For the first month, you will be taught how to work with the program from the user's point of view, teach you how to ‚Äúupdate‚Äù the ‚Äútypical‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-typical‚Äù configuration.  In some franchisees, they give work on the ‚ÄúLine of Consultation‚Äù to consolidate their skills.  In the period of study, and not only, you can always ask advice from senior colleagues, and they will help you. <br><br>  The job of the ‚ÄúITS service engineer‚Äù is to travel to the client and update the database (in fact, click the mouse a couple of times).  About 30 trips per month.  Somewhere around 3-5 trips per day, besides, customers rarely want to see you before 10 -00 and after 16-30.  It is easy to calculate that you will have a lot of free time for training, besides you can read books on the road (I read all the reference books from the 1c kit, I understood little, but later it helped a lot). <br><br>  At this stage, it is important not to be lazy to carry out all the instructions for training, to ask many questions, and in every way to express the desire to learn and work.  Customers will have questions about working with the program, if you do not know the answer on the spot, you can always write a question, solve it in the office (by asking colleagues), call the customer back and tell the solution.  More clients will ask to ‚Äúfinish the program‚Äù, usually these are the simplest improvements, in the early stages you will transfer them to programmers, it would be good to ask your colleagues later how they did it, and try to do it yourself (on a copy, of course). <br><br><h4>  Certificates </h4><br>  The "1c programmers" have "Certification in 1C Company".  In fact, there are two main types of certificates "1c Professional" and "1c Specialist". <br>  Certificates are a confirmation that you at least do not spoil the program, and will give you a bonus to the salary (usually franchisees pay extra to a certified specialist) <br>  The best certificates are ‚Äúplatform‚Äù and ‚ÄúManagement of a manufacturing enterprise‚Äù <br><br><h4>  "1c Professional" </h4><br>  "1c Professional" - user certificate, for knowledge of how to use the program.  It looks like testing from 14 questions and 4-6 answer choices, in order to pass the test, you need to answer at least 12 of them.  Testing is paid, but very cheap.  Tests can be tried to re-take at least every day. <br>  In fact, it seems so. <br><br><h6>  Method 1 </h6><br>  There is a book with questions for the test (sold in 1c, the franchisee must also have one), in the book where there are 900-1000 questions you can try to solve them all and remember.  This is a difficult way, since some questions have been posed, so it‚Äôs not clear what the author wanted to ask. <br><br><h6>  Method 2 </h6><br>  ITS will need disks for 16 months.  The fact is that on ITS disks there are tests for 1s professional, they are an Excel file, a bit protected, it is very easy to pull out. <br>  Passing the test, you will be told what question you answered correctly, you can easily find all the correct answers to all the tests by brute-force (Answer all questions 1, tell yourself which questions answer 1, then answer all questions 2 and note .d.) <br>  Then copy the question-and-answer into one Excel file, so that you can do it like this: A question and only the right answer, you shouldn't bother with the wrong answers.  Next, you need to thoughtfully read and remember what you got, reading 900 Question-answers will take about 2 hours.  Then try to choose a random test from the ITS disk and pass it, practice until you can pass it with confidence. <br>  And then you have to go and pass the test.  Everything about everything will take 3-4 days.  If you fail to pass the first time, ask to retake again, as soon as possible. <br><br><h4>  "1c Specialist" </h4><br>  ‚Äú1c Specialist‚Äù is already an exam, it is necessary to solve the programming problem in the 1c program in 4 hours.  In order for you to be admitted to him, it is necessary to obtain the ‚Äúsame‚Äù certificate ‚Äú1s professional‚Äù.  That is, in order to take the ‚Äú1c Platform Specialist‚Äù exam, you must have a ‚Äú1c professional platform‚Äù. <br>  The exam is taken by a group of about 25 people, 1-3 people from the group successfully pass.  To pass the exam, you need to solve the problem, and then answer the examiner for all questions and justify the decision.  At the exam, you can use the books from "1c", go out the door and do whatever they want (smoking, calling, etc.) <br>  Tasks that will be on the exam can be purchased in "1c", and most likely they will be in your franchisee (perhaps even with solutions).  Previously, it was impossible to buy a book with exam tasks, but on the Internet it was possible to buy a book and problem solving (although the solutions were far from optimal, and I made my own decisions based on them).  In order to pass the exam, it is good to solve all the variants of the problems, then the exam is taken easily and naturally. <br><br>  Congratulations, you are a 1C programmer (although also without skills) <br>  And here you are with the "1c certificates" and you probably will be noticed by the authorities and will offer a new position.  There is already a choice, either to accept the offer, and develop further into the franchisee, or go to the direct employer in the state (for this, it is advisable to work for 1-2 years so that you have work experience). <br><br><h4>  The path to the company where there is a "1c enterprise" </h4><br>  This way, most likely, the system administrator who works in the company with "1s the enterprise" will go.  In fact, everything is simple, you need to communicate with the 1c staff programmer, read the books from the package.  Well buy and solve the book "Practical Developer Guide" and "simple development examples."  When something starts to turn out, you can ask the ‚Äúprogrammer‚Äù what he does and ask him to give you the simplest task (for example, to make a printed form or report), try to do it, show the programmer and find out what is wrong and how to do it better.  Over time, you will "fill your hand."  Again, it's a good idea to find the tasks from the ‚Äú1c Specialist Platform‚Äù exam and solve them all. <br>  Conclusion <br><br><h4>  Pros and cons of working as a 1c programmer in Franchisee or on staff. </h4><br><h5>  1c programmer in the franchisee </h5><br><h6>  pros </h6><br>  1) The friendly team, there is always someone to ask. <br>  2) Trainings, training, etc. <br>  3) Flexible schedule <br>  4) You can build a large customer base and go into freelancing <br>  5) You will work with all possible 1c programs, take a look at a bunch of different code, you will know the latest trends <br><br><h6>  Minuses </h6><br>  1) Low salary, depending on paid bills <br>  2) You have to write bad code, because you need to get money here and now, and the fact that the client wakes up the database a year later is terribly slow, it‚Äôs even good, you can take it for optimization. <br>  3) Traveling nature of work. <br>  4) Terribly obsolete computers from both the franchisee and the client <br>  5) Unpaid leave and sick leave (although not all) <br>  6) Drawing up and filling out work progress reports for the bosses (also not paid) <br>  7) You will have to work with the client whom you will be given, even if he is not a very good person <br><br><h5>  1c programmer in the staff of the employer </h5><br><h6>  pros </h6><br>  1) You have a rate, you need to strain at least and you still get 100% of your salary <br>  2) Normal salary that you always get <br>  3) Ability to bring the code to perfection <br>  4) You can study all business processes of a company. <br>  5) You will have a modern computer <br>  6) Work sitting in one place, not winding around the city <br>  7) You choose to whom you get a job <br><br><h6>  Minuses </h6><br>  1) Programmers are not very appreciated, as they do not bring profit <br>  2) You will have to fulfill all the vagaries of the managers (if the enterprise is a mess, and probably 90% of these) <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  In conclusion, I will say that it is important to be able to read the forum, there is a lot of useful information on them.  Programmer 1c would be nice to understand MS SQL, My SQL.  Do not forget to write a beautiful code with comments and explanations. <br><br>  Thank you all for your attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179225/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179225/</a></p>
