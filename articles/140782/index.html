      Why did I mention the second part of the famous trilogy?  I would venture to express my subjective opinion.  In my opinion, each of the games in the Diablo series has its own atmosphere and personality.  And looking at the outgoing Diablo III, <b>I can not</b> say that I like it. <br><br>  The second part was serious - as serious as a game about fighting the forces of hell could be.  No questioning with the player, no indulgence for a casual audience.  Do you want to play on the complexity of "Hell" - be kind, learn the mechanics of the game, learn to play as a pianist, learn to correctly assess the situation on the battlefield - it is cheaper to avoid some monsters in the "hell" side than trying to kill.  The monsters were drawn ‚Äúin earnest‚Äù, and in combination with the color scheme they created and emphasized the atmosphere. <br><br>  The third part, judging by the set of videos I have seen, is distinguished by the following features: <br>  - sight on kazualov (‚Äúspheres of life‚Äù, general arcade) <br>  - frivolity <br><br>  0) The use of "cartoon" 3D-models - at the time of the appearance of Warcraft 3, this was justified: firstly, in the strategy it is necessary to draw model models in dozens, and secondly, it is much easier to draw a pretty low-poly model in this style.  And for eSports in general it does not matter what to manage, even with multi-colored cubes - the plot and atmosphere are not needed. <br><br>  1) A very bright and ‚Äújuicy‚Äù graphics caused the appearance of a <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/d3art/petition.html">petition</a> from disgruntled fans at one time, which was supported by me - here are some pictures for example: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/342/ad4/35b/342ad435bf335a2aef078fc62ccda514.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d6a/4a8/e60/d6a4a8e6076fa5d941dd323b2e111713.jpg"><br><br>  2) a lot of special effects from spells - often behind them is not visible what is happening on the battlefield <br><br>  3) the regular "ominous" villains arising in the player's way - with the same sinister laughter and hordes of the undead arising from nowhere: this creates the effect of a "strip with obstacles", and not a solid and inhospitable world to the player. <br><br>  4) in some videos I watched the colored digits of damage and the names of combo attacks pop up on the heads of monsters ... It kills any atmosphere of ‚Äúseriousness‚Äù in the bud, because the game resembles eSports.  Get used to the role of the character, to feel in his skin, surrounded by hordes of demons?  What are you speaking about?! <br><br>  5) Having watched the video of the act available in the ‚ÄúD3 closed beta‚Äù, I did not notice that at least once a player was in any danger: even when he was in a crowd of monsters, the ball of life did not noticeably drop. <br><br>  Apparently, not only I have a similar point of view - Path of Exile seems to be created to fill a niche that has been emptied by the marketing of Diablo to the mercy of marketers to extract the maximum margin.  In my opinion, in terms of the visuals and the atmosphere, PoE is very similar to D2, and in terms of graphic design it also comes close to D3.  If you do not limit yourself to a couple of screenshots, but watch a few videos - marvel at how each pixel on the screen is sometimes imbued with the spirit of exactly that good old D2. <br><br>  Among other things, the game is free, and developers exclude the possibility of paid content.  Do you understand what I mean?  If you, as a faithful fan and connoisseur of the game, have been knocking out a unique piece for several days - no son of a bitch can just go to the site and buy the same one for $ 10.  I have no idea about the monetization scheme, I can only share rumors about a very rich sponsor who can afford to pay for the development and support of the game.  And to describe all the buns and features need a separate article. <br><br>  The closed <b>beta test has been going on for almost 8 months</b> (since August 2011), invites were distributed randomly every 20 minutes (all this time), and in the last weeks - every ~ 5 minutes. <br><br>  And here on the weekend the first open stress test was appointed. <br>  Details here: <a href="http://www.pathofexile.com/publicweekend/">pathofexile.com/publicweekend/</a> <br><br>  Exact start time: 4:00 am on the night from Friday to Saturday (March 30-31), but I can <a href="http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_NZ.aspx%3Fy%3D2012%26mo%3D3%26d%3D31%26h%3D13%26mn%3D0">be mistaken for an hour</a> - the subtleties of translation from the New Zealand time during the transfer of hours (with them) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140782/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140782/</a></p>
