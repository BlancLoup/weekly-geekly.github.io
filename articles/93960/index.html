  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft Sharepoint Conference 2010 Attendance Report</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to share my impressions of the conference held yesterday at the Izmailovo Hotel on the occasion of the release of the 2010 version of MS Sharepoint. <br>  So, it all began, as usual, with the registration of participants.  By the way, there were a lot of them, both from Moscow and from other cities of Russia (St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod).  Having received the badges and the package with the schedule and description of the upcoming reports, as well as a pair of advertising leaflets of partner companies, I went to the plenary report. <br><br><h4>  Plenary report </h4><br>  The conference was launched with a greeting from Oksana Prostakova on behalf of the Russsian Sharepoint User Group (RUSUG), while the main actor was Arpan Shah, head of the SharePoint technical development team at Microsoft headquarters.  He spoke very enthusiastically, it was clear that he was proud of the resulting product and was delighted with the various chips and features that the 2010 version is rich in.  He spoke in English, and, despite the fact that everyone who wanted was preoccupied with automatic translators, he tried to select phrases so that they could be understood by everyone.  In the process, he showed a lot of things on a live demo site example: the ability to enable multilingualism in one motion, changing pages ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù, the new Ribbon interface, designed to make Sharepoint even more compatible with Office applications ... It was very interesting and exciting. <br><br>  After the coffee break, the students were divided into 3 halls, where they were followed by parallel lectures on various aspects and innovations of the new platform.  I will tell about visited by me. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Modernization without shock therapy </h4><br>  For me, learning about the technology of updating the existing environment was much more relevant than about the new search or working with external data, so I went without hesitation to the third room.  The presentation of Alexey Krashennikov met my expectations: there were no promises that everything could be done without serious consequences and by magic, three different models were described for the three most common medium options, as well as possible rakes (‚Äúgarden tools‚Äù, according to Alexey: )), which can be found during the migration process, and for which it is necessary to prepare in advance (for example, authorization via web forms is unlikely to work without additional manipulations).  Naturally, those present did not fail to start asking questions about specific cases of 2007 installations and their transfer to the 2010 platform after the end of the presentation.  Not all these questions were answered, but this is understandable: of course, each migration should be considered separately.  But at least I can now outline for myself the plan for the upcoming transfer of my farm much more clearly.

    <h4>  Sharepoint 2010 and Powershell </h4><br>  The next number of my personal program was this lecture.  Powershell I consider as one of the most wonderful and most pleasant tools of the administrator / developer in the Microsoft environment, I admire its flexibility, simplicity and ease of use.  Alexander Romanov mentioned in this speech that powershell is strongly adapted to the Unix shell script, and this is also one of the advantages for me :) In the 2007 versions of Sharepoint and powershell 1.0, it was not so convenient to use: external connection was required and use of the usual .NET features .  With the advent of 2010 SP and Powershell 2.0, as many as 482 sharepoint cmdlets have been introduced directly, which cover the vast majority of administrator and developer needs.  Here and backup \ restore, and work with services, and the ability to edit lists and document libraries, download items, change properties ... It looks all very tasty.  Alexander demonstrated several scenarios that were automated using PS, including creating a site, a list and an item, and restarting Sharepoint 2010 and all related services.  Unfortunately, the presentation did not fit into the allotted time, so there was no time left for questions. <br><br><h4>  Automation of business processes based on SharePoint Workflow 2010 </h4><br>  The next episode was the performance of Mikhail Bondarevsky.  Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt impress me very much (and once again confirmed the idea that good developers are not always good speakers): Mikhail spoke somewhat sluggishly, mostly reading text from slides, rather slowly demonstrated what he was describing (in particular, creating a workflow model in Visio 2010 and its deployment from this model in SP Designer 2010) and periodically made some obvious mistakes.  In general, by the middle of the lecture, I decided that it was not worth it, and retreated to the next room. <br><br><h4>  SharePoint troubleshooting </h4><br>  The presentation of Oksana Prostakova told about how to work on the bugs in the new version of Sharepoint.  In this area, the 2010 version has clearly undergone significant changes.  There was a general log (ULS, Unified Logging Service) and tools to work with it.  Now it is possible to find errors related to a specific page by the Correlation ID assigned to it.  There are tools such as the developer dashboard (a panel that displays useful information for the developer about loading and processing the page) and health monitor (as I understand it, a mini-SCOM that displays the state of the farm and performs certain actions according to the rules set by the administrator or set initially ).  Oksana described the most useful and interesting features of these innovations, and judging by her performance, it will be much faster and easier to diagnose Sharepoint of the new version (at least, I hope that the ‚Äúunexpected error‚Äù 2007 Sharepoint is a thing of the past). <br><br><h4>  SharePoint 2010 Branding </h4><br>  Ilya Boyko talked about how to customize Sharepoint pages ‚Äúfor yourself‚Äù.  He started with the simplest method available to even a not very advanced user: in the 2010 version, you can take the colors and styles from the Powerpoint theme and apply this theme to the Sharepoint node with a slight movement of the hand.  Then came the story of a slightly more complicated way to change the appearance of a node: by changing the CSS styles.  Special ‚Äúcomments‚Äù in CSS text were mentioned that allow you to assign selectors overrides using Powerpoint themes.  And finally, Ilya told about the changes in the master pages, with which you can radically change the page (in particular, the positioning of the blocks on it).  In Sharepoint 2010, a cross-browser layout of elements finally appeared, which is good news: in 2007, I remember, I was very annoyed that no matter how you lick a template, and after using it, everything would spoil the disgustingly generated HTML platform. <br><br><h4>  Round table for IT Pro </h4><br>  The stated theme of this roundtable was, in general, ‚ÄúThe experience and feasibility of migrating from network file resources and Exchange shared folders to SharePoint‚Äù.  The topic, of course, is topical, but it didn‚Äôt have enough quorum, so the organizers decided to expand it to general questions and answers to any topics.  Another hour with a little came to the experts asked questions - and common about the platform, and specific about individual bottlenecks and problems - and experts with varying success answered them.  Maxim Hlupnov used special demand - more than a third of the questions turned out to be sent to him personally :) But the rest did not fall behind. <br><br><h4>  Little about the overall organization </h4><br>  Cons, in fact, was not particularly.  True, before the first lectures there was some confusion with the halls: the plates above the doors did not correspond to reality, so the masses wandered back and forth until finally everything settled down (in order of halls 2, 1, 3 :)).  Another minor drawback was that for some reason there was not a soul in the ‚Äúexpert zone‚Äù every time I got there.  Maybe I was just unlucky :) However, I still quickly found people who were interested in me on the sidelines and filled up questions on topics of interest to me. <br>  All participants got a free book ‚ÄúMicrosoft Office Sharepoint Server 2007 Administrator Guide‚Äù: apparently, as a last chance to learn everything about this platform before moving on to the next :) And for the completed questionnaire, participants were given a CD with materials for study: a collection of a considerable number of posters, guides , descriptions, and the Sharepoint Foundation 2010 installation file. <br>  Separate curtsy for food: coffee breaks and lunch were very tasty :) <br>  In general, I want to say thanks to those who made this conference: it was a success.  I learned a lot about Sharepoint, talked to interesting people, got answers to questions and thought material.  I think that this is true not only for me.  I hope that the first experience of such events was positive for the organizers and speakers, and they will be repeated. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93960/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93960/</a></p>
