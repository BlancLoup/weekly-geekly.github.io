Remember who you were a year or two ago ... Now compare with who you are now ... Please do not rush to read further, and consider whether you are pleased with your progress ?! <br><br>  I am sure that many of you, having thought about it, came to the conclusion that perhaps during these two years they have achieved quite good success.  They did a lot or learned a lot, or earned a decent amount, etc.  And now rewind time back and imagine, what would you COULD achieve in these 2 years?  What would you be able to achieve if you didn't waste time in vain, if you made fewer mistakes, if you took up some idea even then and brought it to mind? .. Think, think.

      I think that now, when you compare, then who you are now and who could not be so much satisfied with yourself will remain. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  And did you wonder why this is happening?  Why even achieving good results we do not get to the level that could?  The common answer is our business.  Perhaps this is so, but maybe this is not the main thing? <br><br>  We take the assumption that we really want to be successful and even know why we need it.  Allowed?  Moving on.  Now imagine that you are surrounded by successful people and expect the same from you.  You feel ashamed to do nothing, because  in a week you must show what you have achieved in these 7 days.  You are prompted, not allowing to make stupid mistakes and suggesting new clever thoughts.  You are not lost in thought, whether to undertake this or that project, because you know that they will help you.  Well, if the idea is not worth the effort, help you understand it and leave it.  Submitted?  Is this utopia?  I do not know about you, but I want to live like this and prove that this is not a utopia at all. <br><br>  Well, now a little completely from myself. <br>  How, I think, you understand, I want to work in an environment of successful or very willing people to become them.  This is not necessarily work in the same office or coworking.  It is rather a work on a common cause.  This may be one of my ideas or yours.  If it is good, then it does not matter much. <br><br>  I am from St. Petersburg, I am a web programmer.  I am writing primarily in PHP, but I am ready to start using ruby.  I have a few more programmers who will easily follow me.  I would be glad if those who consider this not so utopian write me a message or leave a comment here.  Let's unite. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/38382/">https://habr.com/ru/post/38382/</a></p>
