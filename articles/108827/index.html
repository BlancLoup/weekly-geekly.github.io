On this occasion, I would like to take stock of the year right during the high-profile announcements at the event - an alternative, Habra-top, iconic runet event in 2010, so to speak. <img src="http://imghost.makeidea.ru/counter/4561" width="1" height="1"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Recently, conversations about the legalization of content in runet have become increasingly fierce.  Selection of events: <br>  - On February 18, the domain of the largest Russian-speaking torrent tracker <a href="http://torrents.ru/">http://torrents.ru/</a> was recalled, which took several days to move to the .org zone beyond the control of the Russian authorities at <a href="http://rutracker.org/">http://rutracker.org/</a> <br>  - October 18 Vkontakte won the court with the All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, which meant the removal of the need to pay in the direction of the last one million rubles for the content posted by users <br>  - in October, Google, Mail.Ru, VKontakte, Rambler and Yandex published an appeal to the right holders, in which they called for cooperation in combating illegal content posted by users and out-of-court settlement of disputable situations - they are ready to remove user content by request from copyright holders. <br>  - In November, a new version of the amendments to the law on the media, where a new concept of ‚ÄúNetwork Edition‚Äù appeared  Earlier rumors that there will be a mandatory registration of any sites or blogs with more than 1,000 readers have disappeared.  Registration will be optional, and online publications will receive the usual privileges of ordinary media. <br><br>  Thus, the situation was partly civilized, and it was 2010 that became a landmark in the movement to solve these problems, although, as can be seen, it was not without excesses.  In parallel with this, legal platforms with content began to gain strength and popularity in Runet: <a href="http://www.ivi.ru/">http://www.ivi.ru/</a> , <a href="http://www.tvigle.ru/">http://www.tvigle.ru/</a> , <a href="http://music.yandex.ru/">http://music.yandex.ru/</a> .  So far, the speed of their development is questionable - if an illegal turbo film can afford to add new interesting TV shows promptly, then legal platforms will first have long negotiations with copyright holders.

      In 2010, the global social network <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">http://www.facebook.com/</a> and the largest microblogging service <a href="http://twitter.com/">http://twitter.com/</a> finally came to Russia.  If the first one is tough to compete with little in what is inferior to <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/">http://vkontakte.ru/</a> , then the second service has no major analogues in Russia.  On the one hand, the growth of Twitter is slowing down by the lack of a Russian-language interface, on the other hand, most active stars and Internet specialists ‚Äúlive‚Äù on Twitter, and it is there that you can keep track of all the new trends and hot news.  Russian Twitter competitors - <a href="http://juick.com/">http://juick.com/</a> , microblogging service integrated into qip statuses and similar to y.Ru - are not popular, and it is more correct to compare similar Vkontakte functionality with the Facebook communication format. <br><br>  Geo targeting  The fashion trend came to Russia mainly along with Twitter, and some of the active twitter users in Moscow and St. Petersburg use <a href="http://foursquare.com/">http://foursquare.com/</a> , which still has an entertainment function.  His Russian-speaking competitor - <a href="http://altergeo.ru/">http://altergeo.ru/</a> , on the contrary, is actively advertised and offers its users bonuses for activity, which partially crosses it with group shopping services. <br><br>  Group shopping is another fashion trend of the last year.  Anyone who is not lazy, and in every European country, and (especially!) In Russia, took up the cloning of the American <a href="http://www.groupon.com/">http://www.groupon.com/</a> .  More or less living Russian clones are now about twenty, most are working in Moscow and St. Petersburg, some have expanded to major cities in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.  Owners of popular services claim that the business model is incredibly successful. <br><br>  Part of the assets of the investment holding DST was merged into Mail.ru Group.  After entering the IPO, this part of the company (based on Mail.ru, Odnoklassniki, ICQ, half of nnm.ru, quarter of Vkontakte, shares in habrahabr.ru, mamba, nigma, Nival Networks, diary.ru, sape.ru, hh. ru, as well as on Facebook, Groupon and Zinga, has become almost 6 billion dollars and has become the largest holding in Europe. <br><br>  In addition, in 2010, the Internet finally became visible to the state.  The president started a Twitter account, followed by hundreds of other officials who started accounts on LiveJournal and Twitter.  But the main thing is steps towards state transparency.  In some regions (for the time being as experiments), electronic queues are being introduced into polyclinics, <a href="http://www.gosuslugi.ru/">http://www.gosuslugi.ru/</a> and government procurement have become popular.  The popularity of the latter, however, is primarily associated with many scandals about tenders, in particular, the sensational tender, thanks to Navalny‚Äôs efforts, for a two-week development of a social network for medical professionals.  And the main event between the state and the Internet was the opening of the Cyrillic domain zone.rf.  No matter how hard the creators tried to protect themselves from cybersquatters, it was not possible to avoid a grandiose scandal - as we know, the registrars themselves acted as cybersquatters. <br><br>  Useful links on the topic: <br>  - Tina Kandelaki, who was one of the leading Runet Prizes today, also summed up the Internet results of the year.  A look at the same event from a different angle: ( <a href="http://tikandelaki.livejournal.com/170806.html">link</a> ) <br>  - Twitter broadcast of the Runet's award is found on the hashtag #premiaruneta <br>  - Official Runet Premium Twitter - <a href="http://twitter.com/premiaruneta">twitter.com/premiaruneta</a> , live streaming site - <a href="http://www.premiaruneta.ru/">www.premiaruneta.ru</a> <br><br>  <b>Additions</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/speedimon/" class="user_link">Speedimon</a> <br>  Excellent review turned out, I would add this: <br>  Although the Internet audience has not grown several times, it has increased by a significant percentage.  And here it is important to note that this percentage falls mostly not on Moscow / Peter, but almost entirely on regions where adequately inexpensive unlimited has become a reality.  So for me and many acquaintances, therefore, this year was marked by the transition to listening to music online, watching any garbage online (films, sorry, I love it in HD and from 5.1), and online document storage and other things that used to hang exclusively locally.  Now everyone is trumpeting about the transition to the clouds in the cut of large IT infrastructures.  But after all, what I described is just the same transition to the cloud, but simply at the level of an ordinary home user.  Also important trend in general :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108827/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108827/</a></p>
