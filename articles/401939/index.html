Someone with his mother sweeps, someone learns to hammer nails with dad.  Unfortunately, it is often no longer the case that children do the simple work.  But it is known that the kids learn very quickly, often showing excellent results.  What if you teach your child to perform some difficult tasks so that the skills gained can be useful in the future? <br><br>  One option is to teach your child the basics of electronics and programming.  For this there are various toys, designers, mini-PC with a set of sensors.  In addition, you can teach a child carpentry and carpentry.  Here you can guarantee that it will be extremely interesting for the child, and the skills acquired in childhood will help to gain confidence that he can do everything he needs with his own hands.  But how is this possible?  After all, all these saws, nails, drills, blades and other things are very dangerous for kids!  In fact, there is a way out.  It would be a desire, and the way to implement it can be found almost always.  In our case, the output is a multi-function machine for the PLAYMAT tree.  Children's machine, designed for use by older children of preschool age. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2iOoOR_GqNI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The design of the machine thought out as far as possible.  Despite the fact that it can create a lot of different things, all the nodes and elements are completely safe.  Moreover, the developers pay attention to the fact that it is still necessary to teach the child the basics of safety rules when working - this will help in the future to be more careful and to receive less injuries.

    <h3>  How it works? </h3><br>  The machine is modular, the developers themselves call it a transforming kit.  The fact is that this kit contains all the necessary parts to create four different machines: turning, jigsaw, drilling and grinding.  All four are designed for processing wooden elements.  Conversion of one machine to another is done very quickly.  The creators of PLAYMAT say that this was done so that the idea that came to the child‚Äôs mind would not disappear before the machine starts working.  Have a new genius idea appeared?  Forward, to conquer new peaks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/443/6eb/133/4436eb1331620d1d0c7b99ad00c43b6f.jpg" width="950"><br><br>  If you wish, you can buy several machines, collecting a full-fledged production line.  Beds can be docked by developing a single complex.  For example, children can create the first joint venture: a carpentry workshop or a furniture factory.  Work on such a machine children can learn before they go to school. <br><br><h3>  Safety comes first </h3><br>  We like the fact that the developers paid great attention to the security of their complex.  For example, a jigsaw machine will not be able to damage the skin of a child, despite the fact that it allows you to very accurately grind out any form of wood.  Touching the moving elements of the machine, the child will receive only slightly unpleasant sensations that will not harm him, but will allow him to understand that it is necessary to work carefully. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c6f/d86/db4/c6fd86db4fc962c0bdec8af01b538adc.jpg" width="950"><br><br>  The electric motor receives a voltage of only 12 volts, so the child will not receive an electric shock, the power part of the system is harmless, as well as the mechanical part. <br><br>  Also, wear safety glasses while working (they are not included).  Shavings and sawdust fly off from the blanks, so it is worth taking precautions. <br><br><h3>  And what's in the kit? </h3><br>  A lot of everything.  A lot of elements are required for normal operation, all of which are included in the original kit: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Machine bed <br>  ‚Ä¢ Tailstock <br>  ‚Ä¢ Drive unit <br>  ‚Ä¢ drill <br>  ‚Ä¢ Working table for drilling and grinding machines <br>  ‚Ä¢ Grinding disc <br>  ‚Ä¢ tool post <br>  ‚Ä¢ Safe 12 V power adapter <br>  ‚Ä¢ Screwdriver <br>  ‚Ä¢ Half round chisel <br>  ‚Ä¢ Detailed instructions with assembly drawings and practical examples. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Wooden blanks for turning and sawing <br>  ‚Ä¢ Documentation <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a17/05e/d2f/a1705ed2fad5ce3386e139620ffd91e9.jpg" width="950"><br><br><h3>  What can be created using such a machine? </h3><br>  After reading the description and section of security, you can decide that this machine is not enough for what it is - it is thin, plus work items like a drill or saw for a jigsaw look childish.  But in fact, the functionality of PLAYMAT is quite high.  You can do a lot of things with it.  Lost a chess piece?  Not a problem, weave.  No case for a recently created child electronic device?  Everything is also solved.  If desired, you can create complex crafts that will be useful to a child for entertainment and for housework.  Below are some examples of what can be done with a machine. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7GlES1nmbZc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cbh9miKGJ8o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  And the child can make a gift to his mother, grandmother or sister on the 8th of March!  Do not forget, the holiday is near :) <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ymZjYRaqydQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ivlivBgJGE8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ti4XGvP1I1c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  This is only a small fraction of what can be done with the help of PLAYMAT.  By creating various elements and crafts, the child, while learning, will improve his skills.  Here it will be useful to teach your little master the basics of drawing.  In the process of work, the child will develop imagination, improve coordination of movements, learn patience. <br><br><h3>  Specifications </h3><br>  ‚Ä¢ Weight <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1400 g <br>  ‚Ä¢ The size <br>  ‚Ä¢ 325 x 75 x 415 mm <br>  ‚Ä¢ electric motor <br>  ‚Ä¢ 12 V <br>  ‚Ä¢ Spindle speed <br>  ‚Ä¢ 3700 rpm <br>  ‚Ä¢ Power supply (power adapter) <br>  ‚Ä¢ 110-240V, 50/60 Hz, 12V DC, 2 A. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c0e/c74/5ec/c0ec745ec87198ebeece3d8baef189d3.jpg" width="950"><br><br><h3>  Where to buy PLAYMAT </h3><br>  In Russia, this type of machine <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/playmat/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dplaymat">can be purchased</a> from us at Madrobots. <br><br><hr><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dplaymat"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/4c3/07d/d294c307dde04335ac3f425e73b36a7a.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dplaymat"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/417/fe3/7fa417fe3d464fa5aa186b1ab30da53a.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/401939/">https://habr.com/ru/post/401939/</a></p>
