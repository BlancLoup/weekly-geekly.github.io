  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What to do?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, a lot of talk about how to be more efficient, but for some reason it seems to me that this does not work.  No, of course, some practices may be useful, it cannot be denied that the advice ‚Äúnot to be distracted by communication while working, requiring concentration‚Äù is useful, although it is obvious and does not require reading books and attending trainings.  The bottom line is that if you are engaged in a meaningless activity from your point of view, then no system will help, although no, there is one option, if you are engaged in non-creative work, then a taskmaster with a whip can help, well, or hunger, for example. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you have stepped into the 21st century together with civilized humanity - you are not in slavery, do not stand on the brink of survival and are engaged in intellectual, at least partially creative work, then <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation%3Flanguage%3Dru">motivation with kicks or money does not work</a> , which means you must be internally motivated ( what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUC20D8YyX5A">George Carlin</a> thought <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUC20D8YyX5A">about the methods of motivation</a> ), should themselves want to do this work, the one who wants to do will find how to do it ie  most likely, he will work out all the techniques for effective work suitable to him.  Motivation, the desire to work on this problem are primary, and practices of increasing personal productivity follow, they do not replace motivation, but help to implement it. <br><br>  Before you think about <b>how</b> to do it, you should answer the question <b>what</b> to do and think about whether we are replacing one with another. <br><br>  This is where the question ‚ÄúWhat to do?‚Äù Arises, so that the overseer is not required, conceptually the answer to it is simple - to do what you think is important and interesting.  Here are relevant and interesting quotes: <br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/5008/">Richard Hamming</a> <br><blockquote>  Unless you are working on an important task, it is unlikely that you will do an important job.  This is absolutely clear. </blockquote><br>  <a href="http://www.novayagazeta.ru/society/68556.html">John nash</a> <br><blockquote>  I think my main scientific achievement is that I have been doing all my life things that really interest me, and have not spent a single day doing any nonsense. </blockquote><br>  An example is Henry Ford, who used to make his car in his free time, he did not look for methods of motivation and efficiency, his work interfered with his family life and work, but he did it because he considered it important to make equipment accessible to everyone. people's lives (being the son of a farmer, he knew the burden of labor on the land and wanted to make an accessible tractor, and then a car).

      I think it is obvious that the one who is engaged in an inappropriate business will never be the best in him, no matter what talents he possesses, for there are those who are not less talented, but are engaged in the same business with much greater enthusiasm. <br><br>  However, in practice, not everything is so simple, not everyone, like Ford, is enlightened with the idea and is full of energy for its realization, and not all ideas allow one to realize them. <br><br>  The problem of choosing what to do in order to be in harmony with oneself and achieve goals important for oneself, in theory, psychology should help solve.  But in practice, it does not look like she had any serious successes on this front, but managed to find only one similar to the professional MMPI test (there is a version for career guidance, thanks to <a href="http://stratoplan.ru/">Stratoplanovtsam</a> for the hint).  The test results are rather strange, and the test is very ancient, not sure that all modern specialties are there. <br><br>  The problem of choosing accomplices is also not easy, in the near environment it is unlikely to be found, and there are no good tools for searching from the outside (by the way, this idea for a startup is an application for social networks to search for people with a close outlook and goals).  This is good for Silicon Valley - it‚Äôs easier to find the right people in close quarters. <br><br>  I do not have a ready answer, perhaps, Megamind completes the post, but in any case, we must strive for the best, look for something better.  For it is strange to do everything the same, but expect changes. <br><br>  Just change something in life must be <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stop-dont-look-new-job-before-answering-10-questions-bernard-marr">deliberately</a> and purposefully. <br>  And do not forget that <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/nigel_marsh_how_to_make_work_life_balance_work%3Flanguage%3Dru">not a single person lives by work</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291074/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291074/</a></p>
