In addition, IBM will launch 50 projects for the open source software community, the purpose of which will be to accelerate the introduction of services in enterprises and stimulate a new class of innovations in the field of mobility and analytics, as well as other fast-growing areas. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.developer.ibm.com/open">developerWorks Open</a> is a cloud platform where developers have access to the latest IBM solutions, technical knowledge and experience of the company.  In addition, the platform allows you to interact with a global network of programmers to accelerate the creation and implementation of projects.  Developers can not only download the code, but also visit blogs, watch videos, get access to tools and techniques that will help them in their work.  Thanks to the platform, programmers will be able to more quickly create and implement open source applications that would meet the various business requirements of customers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The current development model of the open source software development community does not take into account key strategic business requirements.  To solve this problem, IBM launches a number of industry-specific projects in healthcare, mobile technology, retail, insurance and banking, which are aimed at fulfilling real-life business tasks.

      This announcement confirms IBM‚Äôs commitment to supporting open source software developers.  The company has been leading the open software movement for more than 20 years and has attracted thousands of programmers to develop open source software.  The goal of this initiative is to eliminate the obstacles that prevent developers from creating supported applications from open source that are capable of solving real business problems. <br><br>  Among the vast number of technologies that are already represented on the developerworks Open portal, IBM has opened access to projects in key areas, so that developers can use the most advanced solutions.  Moreover, IBM will launch these services on its software development platform, Bluemix. <br><br>  For example, IBM will open source codes for many MobileFirst mobile solutions portfolio applications.  They are designed to help service developers seeking to enter the healthcare, retail insurance and mobile banking markets. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>The IBM Ready App for Healthcare</b> is an application that, using a mobile device, helps to track the course of patient's treatment during the course of home physiotherapy. </li><li>  <b>The IBM Ready App for Retail</b> will help improve customer service, provide an individual approach and change the consumer‚Äôs perception of shopping in stores through the use of direct communication channels. </li><li>  <b>The IBM Ready App for Insurance</b> helps improve relationships between homeowners and insurers, and also uses various ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù services to synchronize the home with utility meters. </li><li>  <b>The IBM Ready App for Banking</b> will help financial institutions meet the needs of business owners for mobile solutions, as well as attract new customers. </li></ul><br><br>  Moreover, IBM unlocks the source codes of several analytics technologies, including: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Activity Streams</b> will provide developers with a generic model and coding format to describe how users interact with the application and with each other. </li><li>  <b>Agentless System Crawler</b> provides a single cloud monitoring and analytics system with the ability to monitor all types of cloud platforms and runtimes. </li><li>  <b>IBM Analytics for Apache Spark</b> is a solution with which everyone can access the analytical capabilities of the Spark platform.  A beta version is available on Bluemix. </li></ul><br><br>  IBM will also continue to open source codes of cloud data services, including: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>IBM Object Storage on Bluemix Service Broker</b> can be used to integrate OpenStack Swift and Cloud Foundry, providing quick access to data in the cloud no matter where it is located. </li></ul><br><br>  The developerWorks Open launch took place at a critical time for cloud service developers.  Organizations are seeking to maximize the benefits of using multiple cloud environments.  For example, when creating cloud applications, the developer requires a service for storing video and editing photos in order to insure against claims.  There may be difficulties with finding programs and their implementation.  developerWorks Open helps you choose the solution that has the most support in the industry. <br><br>  "IBM is confident that open source is a key factor in the innovative development of applications in the cloud," said Dr. Angel Diaz, vice president of Cloud Architecture and Technology, IBM.  ‚ÄúThanks to developerWorks Open, we are discovering the source code for IBM's advanced solutions that, in our opinion, can help expand the community and become well-known technologies.‚Äù <br><br>  Today, IBM is actively involved in more than 150 open source projects, including Spark, OpenStack, Cloud Foundry, Open Contain Project, Node.js, CouchDb, Linux, Eclipse, and Apache.  With the latter, the company has already established partnerships.  Participation in such projects helps to expand the knowledge and practical skills of working with IBM software products.  The developerWorks Open has become a notable step in the IBM strategy, in which the company supports business in building advanced solutions and innovating through cloud computing systems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/264401/">https://habr.com/ru/post/264401/</a></p>
