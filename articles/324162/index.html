And not commercial, his project is a tool of direct charity.  Children submit applications for toys by attaching their drawings to them, and philanthropists carry out applications and get rights to images.  Victor's hobby project is called ‚ÄúToy for Drawing.  A platform for holding competitions of children's drawings via the Internet, ‚Äùand the author himself spoke more about it. <br><br>  A typical situation: a child asks for an expensive toy that parents cannot buy him.  What is left for the child to do?  Usually - just accept it.  But what will it be like when he grows up and the desire for him comes down bigger, if since childhood he was taught to sit back and give up ambitions?

      <a href="http://www.zarisunok.ru/">"Toy for drawing"</a> suggests from an early age to make efforts to achieve the goal, to look for alternative ways, but to achieve success.  If a particular toy seems expensive to parents, for another person the price of such a gift can be quite feasible.  It remains to apply for a toy, give a link to an online store where the donor can buy this product, write about himself and regularly add his drawings to the application. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In general, children's drawings are the same objects of law as any other images.  They may need someone to decorate an article in a blog, for a PR campaign, just as a keepsake (what if this child is a future president, a great artist or a scientist?). <br><br>  The one who bought the toy and paid for the delivery to the author receives the rights to all the drawings attached to the application.  Now most often applications are carried out for the purpose of charity in order to help children from large families who cannot afford to have something that most peers have.  C "Toy for drawing" anyone can do good to a particular person.  In addition, modern social protection does not provide for any subsidies for toys, and e-commerce allows you to deliver a toy even to the most remote village. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d9/085/806/8d90858060b349b6879ebcc29a45593d.jpg"><br><br>  Why is ‚ÄúToy for Drawing‚Äù called a platform for drawing competitions?  First, anyone can hold their own competition and choose their winner.  If you have children and the need for charity, put them nearby and together look through the applications of his peers.  He will not only appreciate how well he lives himself, but he will also decide to help someone. <br><br>  Secondly, a competition can be held by a commercial or public organization, for example, in order to draw attention to a problem.  To do this, it is enough to register in the position that the drawings for the competition must be submitted to zarisunok.ru.  In this case, there is no need to take care of the receipt and storage of pictures.  And the losers will not be upset - their applications will continue to work even after the end of the competition - they will wait for their benefactor.  When the NGO ‚ÄúLarge Family‚Äù held a contest on ‚ÄúToy for Drawing‚Äù, the children spent a lot of time on the website - they monitored what they ordered, changed their applications, for example, a smartphone on a tablet or a phone with the best characteristics for the same money.  On the platform, personal relationships were made, just like in a social network. <br><br>  An important element of ‚ÄúToys for Drawing‚Äù is the sorting of applications on the main page in order of decreasing regularity of adding pictures; this parameter is called diligence on the website.  That is, if a child really wants a toy, and this is not a whim, but a dream, he does not forget to draw and add new drawings, regularly making efforts.  Thus, he rises in the issuance up, and the chances that his application will be noticed and executed will increase.  By the way, the parents themselves, having seen the diligence of their son or daughter, can sometimes fulfill the wish of the child themselves.  Actually, absolutely anyone can register on ‚ÄúToy for Drawing‚Äù and click the ‚ÄúI want to complete the application‚Äù button. <br><br>  To determine the regularity of adding pictures used methods of mathematical statistics.  For a random variable is taken the time interval between two additions of pictures.  Next, the variance is calculated, and on its basis, a number is constructed in the "Zeal" column. <br><br>  Thus, ‚ÄúToy for Drawing‚Äù instills the skills of achieving success, teaches not only not to give up, but also to act regularly. <br><br>  Zarisunok.ru platform is implemented on CMS Drupal 6. Something has been added to php, for example, the diligence calculation algorithm.  Automated cancellation of the blocking of the application after three days, if there is no confirmation of its execution.  An automatic generation of certificates of participants of competitions held on the platform.  Diplomas are downloaded free of charge in a personal account, which immediately distinguishes the platform from business projects for conducting competitions with a paid issuance of certificates to participants.  If at the moment some kind of competition is being held on Toy for Drawing, a link to the diploma is shown in the application form.  Once a person decides to participate and presses the appropriate button, he can download a paper confirming this. <br><br>  To save disk space, the generated diplomas are not permanently stored, but after a while they are deleted, but they can be recreated at any time if the child has participated in a particular competition. <br><br>  If the project is distributed, it will be possible to rewrite it, leaving the CMS, increasing productivity, making services for use in external programs.  You can create mobile applications that allow you to take a picture of your drawing with your smartphone so that it is immediately added to the application.  But while in the database a little more than a thousand applications for toys, 110 of which are completed. <br><br>  In case of growth, the continued existence of the project may require additional funding.  In this case, I propose to use the mechanism that was used in Pinterest, to add a special Id to links to toys in online stores and receive a commission from the latter. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324162/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324162/</a></p>
