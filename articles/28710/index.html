  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Amorphous herd in the service of his laziness</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Inspired by recent posts, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/social_networks/46011.html">‚ÄúAre you ready to separate yourself from Odnoklassniki, Vkontakte and other similar social networks once and for all?‚Äù</a> And <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/arbeit/45923.html">‚ÄúIs it legal to monitor an employee‚Äôs computer?‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  <strong>Whence thoughts.</strong> <br>  Returning from the next building in our business center and passing by the panoramic windows of the first floor, I threw my eyes inside to find out what was going on inside and what the employees were doing.  I was, to say the least, surprised.  90% of the employees were clearly not engaged in their direct responsibilities - VKontakte, classmates, several games, forums, VKontakte again, classmates again, VKontakte again and so on almost all monitors that came into my field of vision. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>What do I think.</strong> <br>  No, I am by no means opposed to social networks, games and communication on the forums.  You like it - freak out on your grades, get mad at the fours, hit the keyboards with your fist, when you click ‚ÄúQuick Save‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúQuick Load‚Äù, prove your point to a frenzy, splashing others around with saliva.  But not in the midst of the working day and not all the office! <br><br>  In general, lately, I have been increasingly thinking that people can be divided into 3 gross types: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"

        </script>
      <br>
      - People who want to achieve the maximum in their work, in their hobbies and in their personal lives.  Never stop on achieved. <br>  - People who are responsible for their work are very good executive employees.  Having settled on an interesting well-paid job, they stop and just live.  They live by the possibilities. <br>  - Ballast.  People who think that they are all obliged around.  The state is obliged, personally the president is obliged to everyone something, the employer is obliged.  In general - an amorphous dull boring flock. <br><br>  It seems to me - the third category is the main obstacle in the development of the company, it is a stumbling block for many businessmen. <br><br>  Very often I hear the phrases - ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to raise my salary,‚Äù ‚ÄúI am 23 years old, and I have a salary of 15 thousand.‚Äù  Guys, what did you do to raise your salary, what did you do to earn more?  You just whine and whine!  Whine and whine!  And at work the entire department sets all day records at EtiSports, and then in the evening, drinking cheap beer in the yard on the bench or at the subway, you heartily tell you how you didn‚Äôt work all day, but played and how you almost burned.  And all this is accompanied by the nagging of crap life and the terrible structure of society.  I propose to decide what you need - to suffer bullshit all day and get a penny, or work normally and live normally.  If you want to blunt and you are satisfied with your pennies - live, as you know, but do not pull the rest!  Have respect.  You were recruited to work, not to communicate with another macho or aunt with lips and tits of the third size.  At work, you need to WORK!  Strange, yes?  In my opinion, no.  Where this infantilism comes from in people who have reached the third dozen - I have no idea.  But the fact is that it is - undeniable. <br><br>  PS The third category practically does not include people who, to varying degrees, work in IT.  We have more than 40 employees in the company, there are no blockages on the sites.  But at the same time, no one in particular is sitting in the social sphere and does not play games.  And if they sit, then in no way at the expense of work.  It seems to me that in our whole sphere this is exactly the picture. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28710/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28710/</a></p>
