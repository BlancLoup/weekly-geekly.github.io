    </i>  <i>Here are <b>9 ways to share the work</b> , allowing you to constantly see the goal and take steps to achieve it.</i> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. Do not break the chain</font> </h2><br>  How are you doing with procrastination? <br><br>  I am sure Jerry Seinfeld asked this question several times during his career.  The productivity of Seinfeld should be incredible: he not only creates a hit sitcom, but also constantly writes new jokes for his stand-up speeches.  And here it definitely wasn‚Äôt without ‚ÄúDon't break the chain‚Äù equipment. <br><br>  At the beginning of each year, Seinfeld buys a large calendar and hangs it on the wall.  And then he marks with a bold red cross every day when he creates a new material.  If you write for several days in a row, a chain of red X appears on the calendar. <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-ostavatsya-proizvoditelnym-v-2016-godu-23-soveta-ot-lari-kima/">The goal for the year</a> is simple: do not break the chain. <br><br>  This method is based on the fact that the opportunity to draw a big red cross brings great pleasure.  This means that you won and did everything you wanted.  An empty day at the center of such a chain looks like an insult.  He gazes at you, destroying the carefully created pattern. <br><br>  Technique "Do not break the chain" can be used for crushing work.  Let's say you have one big task, the fulfillment of which takes a whole day.  Break it into 4-5 smaller tasks.  Having coped with one little thing, put it on the X calendar. When you finish another, draw an X of a different color in the same cell.  If you do not do something, the absence of a cross will not go unnoticed. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Machine with popcorn</font> </h2><br>  Wherever you work - in the office or at home, the monotonous environment of the four walls becomes tedious.  You begin to feel like a prisoner, and this, of course, affects productivity. <br><br>  The ‚ÄúMachine with popcorn‚Äù method is capable of solving this problem, especially if you <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/rabotaete-doma-6-sposobov-podderzhaniya-sosredotochennosti-i-produktivnosti/">work at home</a> .  Make a list of what you need to do in a day.  All tasks must be specific and feasible.  Then write down how long it will take to complete each item.  Be realistic!  Now divide the tasks into 3 equal time segments. <br><br>  Choose 3 different locations - a cafe, library, office, park or any other quiet place where you can work.  Go to the first of the items and complete the first task list.  When finished, go to the next place and grasp the second list.  Having coped with it, again "move." <br><br>  Changing the situation will refresh your mind, especially if you work on the air.  In addition, the transition from one location to another will allow you to separate one work segment from another.  Using this method, you will crush the work and do significantly more in a day. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Work distribution schedule</font> </h2><br>  Work on a large project and do not know how to cope with it?  Then the distribution schedule is for you.  He divides your project into practical steps leading to its completion, and gives the team an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat needs to be done. <br><br>  The graph consists of 4 components: <br><br>  1. <b>Terms of Reference.</b>  This sentence or short paragraph clearly describes the goal.  It allows you to understand what you are trying to achieve and how.  Having lost confidence in the correctness of their actions, you can always return to the TK and consult with him. <br>  2. <b>Phases.</b>  These are common tasks needed to complete all the work.  The number of phases depends on the volume of the project, but on average they are usually 2 or 3. <br>  3. <b>Intermediate results.</b>  Here we are talking about more specific tasks leading to the execution of each phase.  You need to get to each of the results, then to go to the next phase.  For each of these parts, there must be a description of its goals. <br>  4. <b>Tasks.</b>  These are the smallest components of a work distribution schedule.  They should be practical and specific.  Details are important here.  Assignments should give you a complete picture of what you need to do in order to realize the main project. <br><br>  From these points a phased action plan is created.  He clearly defines what the task is, who should work on it, and when it should be completed.  A huge project can stun, you can be scared to take it. <br><br>  By crushing the work, you get a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe upcoming steps.  Now the project seems less frightening, and your motivation is increasing. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. Bringing to the result</font> </h2><br>  You may have heard about ‚Äúbringing to the result‚Äù before.  ‚ÄúGetting to the Results‚Äù (‚ÄúGetting Things Done‚Äù) is <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/intervyu-s-devidom-allenom/">David Allen's</a> bestseller, which tells about the art of productivity without stress.  In his book, Allen writes about the popular method of increasing productivity, ‚ÄúBringing to the result‚Äù.  This complex system rests on 5 pillars: <br><br>  1. <b>Fix.</b>  Write down everything.  Any ideas, business or everyday tasks should be recorded on paper or in Word-document.  Be sure to write down as soon as you think about something.  You should always have a notebook or electronic device at hand. <br>  2. <b>Clarify.</b>  By writing something down, you need to know specifically how you are going to achieve it.  Fix the practical steps that will lead you to the desired. <br>  3. <b>Systematize.</b>  Divide your tasks into categories and prioritize.  Tie them to dates and determine the importance of each item.  Make a to-do list and put your most important tasks on top.  They need to be done first. <br>  4. <b>Analyze.</b>  Take a look at the to-do list and make sure your priorities are right. <br>  5. <b>Get started.</b>  For the work!  Choose what you do and move to the goal step by step. <br><br>  These are the basic principles of the ‚ÄúBringing to the result‚Äù method.  You can customize it for yourself, but do not forget about the main idea.  Break down tasks into concrete steps and complete important tasks first. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. Must, should, want</font> </h2><br>  This technique will help you determine the level of importance of tasks.  Every morning you need to ask yourself 3 questions: <br><br><ul><li>  What should I do today to make the most impact? </li><li>  What should I do to create a better future? </li><li>  What do I want to do to enjoy the day and make my life better? </li></ul><br>  This method is called "Should, should, I want."  You need to honestly answer these questions before you begin your day, and record the resulting answers. <br><br>  By doing this, you divide your affairs based on their degree of importance.  Tasks from the ‚Äúmust‚Äù category are absolutely urgent.  They cannot be left for tomorrow, because your near future depends on them. <br><br>  Cases "should" pay off over time.  Most likely, they do not require immediate attention, but still loom in your mind.  You understand that one day you will have to turn to them, and therefore it is better to deal with them early.  However, they are not urgent. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI want‚Äù are the things you do for fun.  They are not obligatory, and maybe they are not needed at all, but they make your world brighter.  Perhaps you want to watch a movie or start writing a book.  These are actions that bring you joy. <br><br>  Now your business is divided into groups depending on their importance and urgency.  This will help you determine what needs to be done and plan your day accordingly. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">6. Biological prime time</font> </h2><br>  When do you work most efficiently?  Early in the morning after charging?  In the middle of the day?  Or is it more comfortable for you to work late at night when most people sleep? <br><br>  The ego depletion indicates that our concentration and motivation changes throughout the day.  There are certain moments when energy, focus, motivation and performance are at their peak.  They are called ‚Äúbiological prime time‚Äù. <br><br>  It is important to know about such periods, because they show when your brain is ready for work.  To identify such moments, you need to track your energy level for three weeks.  Try not to drink coffee and do not nap during the day.  So you will find the natural periods of prime time, and not achieved by doping. <br><br>  Then you must break up your work at these intervals and schedule it based on biological prime time.  So you will work when you are ready for this, and you can do more than <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/lozhnaya-sueta-kak-postoyannaya-zanyatost-umenshaet-produktivnost/">sitting at a table all day</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">7. Method of action</font> </h2><br>  Some of these methods imply that you should put specific tasks in your to-do list and work only on them.  Yes, it may be useful.  But the ‚ÄúMethod of Action‚Äù goes further and states: each event is a task. <br><br>  Yes, it is true: all affairs in a day can be entered in the list of affairs and divided into practical steps.  The action method suggests crushing everything into 3 main components: <br><br>  1. <b>Steps of action.</b>  Specific tasks that bring you closer to completing the work being done. <br>  2. <b>Background information.</b>  Any information to which you want to return when working on a specific project - notes, instructions, tutorials, websites.  Background information - these are any resources that help you cope with the task. <br>  3. <b>Secondary items.</b>  Impossible tasks now, to which you will have to return one day. <br><br>  If you use the method of action, then everything can be divided into these 3 components.  By distributing your affairs, you will get a better idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhen to handle them and how to cope with them. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">8. List 1-3-5</font> </h2><br>  To-do lists can be of great benefit if they are properly structured.  We have already reviewed several principles for their preparation.  List 1-3-5 takes the to-do list to another level. <br><br>  List 1-3-5 is a list of tasks in which daily tasks are ranked by importance.  Every day you should perform one major task, 3 medium and 5 small ones.  That is, every day you deal with 9 cases that differ in importance. <br><br>  List 1-3-5 helps you prioritize and evaluate each task.  By limiting the number of your cases, he protects you from overload.  But at the same time you have a lot of time, and you <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/svobodnoe-upravlenie-vremenem-realnost-ili-mif/">have enough time</a> to focus on each task. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">9. Personal Kanban</font> </h2><br>  Personal Kanban is a method that combines specific steps of the to-do list with the visual appeal of Jerry Seinfeld's principle ‚ÄúDon't break the chain.‚Äù  All you need is a board, a few self-adhesive sheets and tasks. <br><br>  The board should be divided into 3 columns: <br><br>  1. <b>Flaws / done.</b>  These are the tasks that need to be completed, which you have not started yet. <br>  2. <b>In the process.</b>  These are the things you are working on right now.  You can also use a separate sheet for each step. <br>  3. <b>Done.</b>  All solved problems fall into this column.  There is nothing better than to admire what you have already managed. <br><br>  This simple method helps to increase productivity.  Moving assignments from one column to another gives a sense of progress that is impossible to obtain using the to-do list.  The growth of motivation is also provided by the opportunity to see your own results. <br><br>  In addition, this way you get rid of excessive load: an excess of cases immediately catches the eye.  Personal Kanban helps you monitor your own productivity and at the same time reduces the number of tasks. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Separate and get to work</font> </h2><br>  If you want to increase your productivity and achieve your own goals, use these 9 most effective techniques for crushing work.  Now you only need to get down to business and become a more productive employee! <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the work on oneself - the <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/nauka-o-tom-kak-razvit-duxovnuyu-stojkost-v-rabote-i-v-zhizni/">science of how to develop spiritual endurance in work and in life</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.ru/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/305556/">https://habr.com/ru/post/305556/</a></p>
