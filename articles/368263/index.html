    <h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Episode I Red Pontiac, as a ticket to the music industry</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7db/ca5/1ee/7dbca51ee21748d79b03a8b4bfc1fde0.jpg"><cut><br><br>  Like many wonderful events in this world, Jerry hit the world of music and big concert tours by accident. <br>  In 1980, the Gland Slam Superjam tour with the participation of April Wine, Judas Priest and Sammy Hagar took place at the Busch Stadium in St. Louis.  Jerry himself, a 19-year-old boy from Missouri, was picking his red Pontiac Trans Am in 1978, when the guys from Sammy Hagar approached him and asked to borrow his car in exchange for free tickets.  Harvey's car drove onto the stage during Sammy's hit Trans Am (Highway Wonderland). <br><br>  The promoter of the performance offered Harvey a job, with the result that Harvey got into the technical staff of the local group The Agents.  And apparently, the guy had a really uncommon talent, otherwise how to explain the fact that, being still a minor (coming of age in the United States comes at 21), and not having, in fact, the right to work at concert venues, Jeria moves to the group's sound producer.  So began the career of a sound engineer.  Soon, Jerry was already working with sound from such teams as Kiss, Morrissey and The Cult. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Episode II Van Halen, as an idea ...</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ab/8db/cc6/9ab8dbcc67934063a1981f90d9146f33.jpg"><br><br>  1986, Jerry meets David Lee Roth, the vocalist of Van Halen, who is then at the height of his fame, and begins working with the sound of the team on tour.  And so, in preparation for one of the concerts on the 1995 The Balance tour, the most crucial for the entire musical sphere was the conversation of Alex Van Halen, the drummer with Jerry, whose meaning was that during the performance on stage, the musicians were very It is difficult to coordinate their actions due to too loud work of stage monitors.  Some decision was needed ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/069/a88/844/069a88844ae342b9853b730efbfc6c74.jpg"><br><br>  ... And the solution was found.  And it lay, in fact, on the surface.  It is strange that no one had thought of this before.  We take miniature speakers for a pacemaker, supplement it with the necessary electrician, remove the ear cast, pack all this stuffing into the case created from this cast, connect it to the receiver, send a signal to the mixing console and voila ... the world's first concert ear monitoring system is ready!  Just ... like all brilliant ... <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Episode III Ultimate Ears</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/83a/b1f/c33/83ab1fc337f1408eb468292ec354dcc4.jpeg"><br><br>  Jerry‚Äôs invented device quickly became popular with touring musicians.  For example, the guys from Skid Row instantly wanted the same ‚Äúdevice‚Äù for themselves and were even ready to thank Harvey financially well.  In general, after the third order, the idea to make this business was born by itself ... Thus, the Ultimate Ears company was born. <br><br>  There was only one problem.  Harvey did an excellent job with the production of the engineering part of the device, but he had no idea how to package the whole thing in the case.  Therefore, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/icover/blog/262036/">Westone</a> appears on the horizon - at that time a manufacturer of medical solutions in the field of hearing protection.  It was at a factory in Colorado Springs that Ultimate Ears placed orders for casting custom casings for its star customers.  As a result, the result of the joint work of the two companies in 1998 was the later legendary Ultimate Ears UE-5, and by the beginning of the XXI century zero, performing without stage monitors among the performers was already considered a move.  The industry has changed forever and promised a bright future.  But the thunder suddenly struck ... <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Episode IV I'll be back</font> </h2><br>  I don‚Äôt know whose flaw it was, but in 2001 Jerry unexpectedly found out that <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/icover/blog/262036/">Westone</a> claimed all joint development rights, launched its own distribution network in Europe and, moreover, had all the rights to the Ultimate Ears trademark and individual ear impressions shells musicians.  It was a stab in the back ... <br><br>  I had to urgently interrupt the concert activities and learn the nuances of jurisprudence.  As a result, justice prevailed, the US judicial system fully justified its motto "... And Justice for all" and Jerry regains control over the business.  The problem, however, was that Harvey still knew nothing about the production of custom casts.  And the problem had to be solved as quickly as possible.  As a result, a trip to Florida, full immersion in the study of the topic, acquaintance with Chophorn "Noah" Sandali and by April 2002 Ultimate Ears resumes its activities.  The benefit of almost all the musicians in this battle sided with Harvey. <br><br>  And in 2003, while touring with Linkin Park, one of the staff showed Jerry a device that was invented by another Genius ... the iPod was called ... It became clear that it was time to go beyond the world of professional musicians and meet the average consumer. <br><br>  The result of this work was the consumer-headphone line for ordinary users and in 2007, after the UE-11 model came out, Ultimate Ears was absorbed by Logitech, but Jerry was no longer in the company ... he left nine months earlier.  Something like Steve and the Pixar story ... <br><br>
<h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Episode V "... I‚Äôll start again from the beginning for the hundredth time" ... JH Audio</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/393/00f/8e0/39300f8e043d4ff6ab724dd93af47227.jpg"><br><br>  After leaving Ultimate Ears, Harvey was deprived for some time of the opportunity to work in his specialty by agreement with Logitech.  This time is dedicated to the family, the new wife and the health of the newborn daughter ... However, Harvey would not be Harvey, if he had not returned, and at the end of 2007, JH Audio was born.  And orders for 300,000 dollars in the first year of work, prove that Jerry is still "in the cage." <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Episode VI The story of one unrequited love, as a reason to create two masterpieces.</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/88d/d1c/9df/88dd1c9dfdb94a3f869145f539afbe1b.jpg"><br><br>  "... He fell in love with her almost as soon as he saw ... The only problem was that she was married to his best friend."  Old as the world is a story, some thousands ... but only ‚ÄúRomeo‚Äù was not called somehow, but Eric Klepton, ‚ÄúJuliet‚Äù is Patty Boyd, the famous fashion model of the 60-70s, part-time wife of George Harrison, guitarist The Beatles and Clepton's Best Friend.  All that remained in this situation for poor Erik was to write songs ... this is how the famous Layla was born, dedicated to this particular period in the life of a musician. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZtxO1gwbHPQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhilkZUmD3wMtbKc3TsgpoX9krnilg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  You ask: ‚ÄúWhat does Jerry Harvey mean?‚Äù But the whole thing is that this story, in addition to composition, led to the creation of another masterpiece - a model called JH Audio Layla, which is currently the flagship of the JH Audio line and the top Jerry's engineering thought.  The model is available in a custom version, directly from JH Audio, and in the finished version.  as a joint development with Astell &amp; Kern <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/iriver_astell_kern_psf11_layla_vnutrikanalnye_naushniki_black/">iRiver Astell &amp; Kern PSF11 Layla</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aeb/ed3/ecf/aebed3ecf44f44a098f7e04f9a544c96.jpg"><br><br>  This is a brief history of Jerry Harvey - the legendary sound producer, businessman, brilliant man who continues to delight audiophiles of the whole world to this day ... I hope this is not the last page in this glorious story, and someday I will have the opportunity to describe it new episodes ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúLayla is the first headphones that I developed as reference / mastering inter-channel monitors.  Most of the previously developed in-ear headphones I have have a live Rock'n'Roll sound with a slightly more pronounced emphasis on low and high frequencies.  In this model, the return at low frequencies with the minimum settings is absolutely flat, and at the maximum they give out 13 dB at 60 Hz.  Layla, like Angie, has the most complex crossover circuit that has ever been used for headphones of this type.  Four-way crossovers in combination with new stainless steel waveguides and patented drivers provide a sound quality that allows any listener to feel like in a recording studio or behind a mixing console.  Hear exactly what the producer and the band wanted you to hear. ‚Äù </cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368263/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368263/</a></p>
