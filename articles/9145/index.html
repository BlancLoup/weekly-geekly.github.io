  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Intelligent social environment: how to make a fairy tale come true?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As I promised, I want to clarify some of the requirements for My Space, which I can not find on the Internet ( <a href="http://amilner.habrahabr.ru/blog/12373.html">amilner.habrahabr.ru/blog/12373.html</a> ).  In this post I answer the first group of questions that are often asked me when I talk about the desired resource.  However, before I begin, I want to thank mastak, tim_tim, Vox and other citizens of habrahabr for the interesting comments, in many respects, thanks to which this note appeared. <br><br>  <b>What kind of users do you mean?</b>  The social resource I‚Äôm looking for is positioned for true professionals, and it doesn‚Äôt matter what industry or field of activity they work for.  And it‚Äôs not even the essence that their age is important, although I still, despite the assumption of the mastak, continue to think that ‚Äúmy‚Äù typical user is at least 30 years old.  Moreover, and it is very important, I refer only intelligent people to real professionals.  Apparently, not everyone paid attention to the latter.  Maybe because everyone has their own understanding of the concept of a <i>professional</i> .  Therefore, I will say more directly.  The sought resource is an <b><i>intelligent environment for intelligent people</i></b> .  Thanks to the Russian language for the concept of <i>intellectual</i> .  This word is understood by everyone in the same way.  Even those who usually add to it a prefix <i>rotten</i> .  And those who at the mere mention of him "used to grab his gun (in our case, a <i>shovel</i> )."  So, I do not need additional clarifications.  With English in this plan is worse.  Here you have to define ‚Äúmy‚Äù resource as something like a <i>pure content place (environment)</i> .  However, let us leave English alone for now. <br><br>  <i>After habracut go short answers to other questions.</i>  <i>More detailed answers can be found in my blog (http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=18157).</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Is the range of potential consumers of an intelligent social environment (ASC) wide or narrow?</b>  It seems to me that is quite wide.  Moreover, ICN should combine the possibilities of both B2C and B2B.  In its business orientation, this environment turns into a gaining momentum in Enterprise 2.0 with positioning for small and medium-sized companies (SME). <br><br>  <b>What is extremely important for consumers of ASC?</b>  I believe that this is, above all, the informational purity and culture of relations within the ESS - community (s). <br><br>  <b>Why do you oppose shovels?</b>  I do not mind shoveling, in general.  I am against the already established social media, unfortunately, it is already a tradition to use this useful tool to crack down on ‚Äúideological‚Äù opponents. <br><br>  <b>How to rank information?</b>  We are naturally talking about pure information.  Dirty just nothing to do in the ISS.  I see two main criteria for evaluating a message (posting): conflict and relevance.  Each of these criteria I can easily identify. <br><br>  <b>Why are you against karma?</b>  Yes, because the only criterion for evaluating a professional in the ISS, from my point of view, should be the result of his information work in quantitative (less important) and qualitative (more important) measurements.  Provided that the Code of Honor is performed by all, extraordinary thinking, which is not always and not everyone loves, will only decorate any community. <br><br>  <b>How is the list of recommended information formed?</b>  In addition to the more or less traditional content filters (categories, tags, tags, keywords, etc.), in ISC, personal filters are widely used to filter users who have entered and evaluated information.  In other words, each user can influence the ranking of other users to their own taste.  But unlike the traditional approaches based on the friend-to-enemy criterion, such a personal assessment of other users is closed to all others and in no way affects the overall status of any user. <br><br>  <b>Is it possible to still have a friend in the ISS?</b>  Of course, it is possible, but mainly for communication purposes, just like it is done on LinkedIn.  However, the number of friends will not affect your status.  Conversely, your status will in no way affect the status of your friends.  In other words, friendship is friendship, and service (more precisely, information work) is service. <br><br>  <b>Who can be entrusted with the cessation function?</b>  Naturally, at the beginning of the moderation will carry out the administration of the ISS.  As the resource becomes established, this process should be gradually transferred to something like the ‚Äúcouncils of elders,‚Äù or ‚Äúsupreme courts,‚Äù created by each individual professional community.  Only they can bury the information and impose fines on its sources, up to the exclusion from the resource. <br><br>  <b>Who to check?</b>  All newbies - during their trial period.  All those who were punished earlier - until the time of the removal of punishment.  Selectively - all the rest.  Although there is hope that in the ISS the need for moderation will gradually become increasingly weak.  After all, it is known that rats and cockroaches do not live in clean places.  I think the same rules apply to social networks. <br><br>  <i>Once again I want to remind you that an extended version of this note (with all links) is posted on my blog (http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=18157).</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9145/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9145/</a></p>
