The originality of the idea lies in the fact that it (hosting) will be executed in accordance with the criteria of any project in the spirit of the so-called web 2.0. <br>  The client is not easy, as it happens absolutely for all hosting providers at the moment, receives disk space and a domain for his site, and he becomes part of a community of clients (webmasters) like himself. <br>  He participates in discussions, can get any help, any advice (for example on the control panel) from other clients, he can give advice himself, can conduct conversations and personal correspondence thanks to internal mail. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  He also participates in the development of the hosting itself, can offer and put up for discussion by the remaining clients some ideas on hosting development and if these ideas are approved by the majority of clients, they are implemented (for example, the creation of a new tariff or some additional service) ). <br><br>  Also, the community will have a certain internal budget, which it (the community, represented by the majority opinion) will be able to spend.  For example, one user offered to place the official website of an orphanage free of charge; if this idea is supported by the majority, then the necessary funds are deducted from the internal monthly budget and we give this children's home a place for their website.

      This community will also be a platform for communication about the development of their projects to promote them.  A rating of client sites will be compiled, which will vary in accordance with the opinion of the clients - members of the community. <br>  Each user will have a level of authority (an analogue of ‚Äúkarma‚Äù on <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/">Habr√©</a> ), there will also be an internal account on which information about him will be posted.  The client will be able to make a list of his friends.  It will be possible for your friends not only to help with advice, etc., but also with money, thanks to internal money, which they can transfer to each other, give a loan, pay for hosting or (possibly) advertise their site on the community chat page ( like this on <a href="http://news2.ru/">news2.ru</a> ). <br><br><img src="http://www.crumblife.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/resize-of-fileeih81p.jpg" alt="Character :)" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="5">  <strong>The second originality of the</strong> idea is that the hosting will have a character - a character (for example, an animal like a hamster living in a data center), about which a series of humorous, social, etc. will be published regularly.  cartoons, such as <a href="http://mult.ru/">Masyanya</a> (there is an example of a character. The name of the character will coincide with the name of the hosting, that is, he will personify it in all senses. &lt;o: p&gt; &lt;/ o: p&gt; The customers themselves will be able to submit ideas for further series of the cartoon (maybe comic.) The cartoon will be published once a month or two in honor of the holidays. &lt;o: p&gt; &lt;/ o: p&gt; An example of such a character can be robots from Futurico Inc ( <a href="http://futurico.ru/">http://futurico.ru/</a> ). <br><br>  <u>Competitive advantages:</u> <br>  The main competitive advantage will be that any client will be able to get the advice he needs on using hosting, promoting and promoting his website at any time convenient for him.  The client, thanks to the internal social network will be able to find partners and their own clients;  he will become part of the community. <br><br>  Also to the benefits is to include the human appearance of the employees of the hosting, all employees themselves will participate in communication in the social.  network.  Also, any of our mistake, the client will be able to put on the flaw in front of all customers, which will force us to avoid it. <br><br>  Consolidating clients into a single community will also provide a cartoon about, symbolizing the hosting itself, a character that will be discussed transferred from a computer </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12544/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12544/</a></p>
