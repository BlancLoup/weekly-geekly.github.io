According to our subjective calculations, 40% of the audience in <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/program/qa">the QA section</a> are specialists not directly involved in testing: developers, managers, DevOps, and even designers. <br><br>  This year we will try to satisfy the interests of all interested: let's talk about automation, management, infrastructure and the sale of dumplings in the store. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  How to get the most out of automation? </h2><br>  Automation is often a basic test suite that is used in addition to manual testing, the main users and customers of which are QA.  But what if you try to expand the usual framework?  Employees of other areas sometimes do not even suspect that the results of autotests can be useful to them.  How to benefit a colleague from the next room and make it work a little easier, tell the guys from Netcetera, Badoo and Mail.  Ru.
