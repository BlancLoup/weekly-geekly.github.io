  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Buying a facebook template: what to look for?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So today I want to talk about patterns for the social network facebook.  This direction is now going forward with large steps.  Incidentally, I cannot understand why Durov has not yet ‚Äúinvented‚Äù something similar for his brainchild.  But now is not about that.  I also just want to say that 90% (this is an approximate number without any mathematical basis and written with the sole purpose of replacing the word ‚Äúmany‚Äù or ‚Äúalmost 100%‚Äù) is taken from one of my favorite blogs, about which I often write in my posts.  So in this blog there is an article <a href="http://wdremix.net/2011/07/04/the-facebook-template-what-to-pay-attention/">The Facebook Template: What to pay attention?</a>  which appeared around the time when I started paying more attention to facebook.  In general, I liked the information in this article and I want to share it with you, however, adding a little from myself. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's start from the very beginning, namely from the fact that we stipulate the following: in order to successfully advertise your business or just a resource on the world wide web, you need to use all possible directions, one of which is social networks (now we are talking specifically about facebook as the largest social network)!  So, you are registered on facebook, have already created a page for your business (hobbies, hobbies, etc.), publish news on it, upload photos and decide to add an FBML application.  But to do this, you need the template itself. <br><br>  Let's choose the places where you can buy facebook templates (you can do them yourself, but I plan to write about this in another article, but for now we'll talk only about purchases).  This issue should be treated with extreme caution, as there are many shops with similar templates, but the quality of these templates leaves much to be desired!  So now I will describe the main resources with high-quality facebook templates in which I am sure! 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      So where to go to buy a template?  The first are the envato stores that have already proven themselves in the template market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/9c11dce3/305b4ef0/68ba36c1/4fc0cf95.jpg"><br><br>  Or rather, one of its divisions is <a href="http://activeden.net/">activeden</a> ! <br><br>  The second place to look is <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/">Templatemonsters</a> , who recently began to persevere in Facebook templates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d397cde7/e5e5d8b9/bbde692f/7cd998f1.jpg"><br><br>  And by the way, if you decide to buy a template for your facebook page without sparing financial resources, then you can safely take a template marked premium (these are templates created by the motocms team)!  Since these templates have their own admin panel and you can always effortlessly change any text, image, location of elements and other settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/63ed51dc/c7a49061/a9299e97/140002a8.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, motocms on Habr√© has a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/motocms/blog/">blog</a> !  The only disadvantage of facebook data patterns is their price! <br><br>  Now I think it is worth considering a resource where you can buy 3 different templates for the price at which you can buy one on motocms.  Yes, yes, there are such resources, and the quality of their templates, in my opinion, is not inferior in almost anything (well, except for the absence of the admin panel, of course).  So, I'm talking about <a href="http://fanfbmltemplates.com/affiliate/38">FanFBMLTemplates.com</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/bce5cab6/68df1841/a6f4f930/f73fd0c4.jpg"><br><br>  This is the third place where you can look in the search template. <br><br>  In general, the above resources have in their assortment a large number of templates, among which even the most fastidious buyer will be able to choose something for himself! <br><br>  Now more about the templates themselves!  If you noticed, all facebook templates are mostly flash templates.  Why to create such templates use technology that goes out of fashion (the times of flash templates have already passed, since now many developers have moved to more modern and productive directions in creating templates; for example, such as wordpress, joomla and others, and use jQuery, HTML 5 and etc.) It's very simple and you will understand now why.  When creating fbml pages, you should enter only one code (if you have already created such pages, you understand me), while all the pictures and other files should be on a separate server.  And to implement a multipage website that can be launched using simple code, it is easier to flash.  Of course, you can find static templates without using flash, but more often they are single-page templates for which you don‚Äôt want to pay for anything.  On such templates basically only a small part of the information is placed (contact information, information about the creator, photo, logo).  But I repeat once again that such a template is easier to make yourself than to buy. <br><br>  What else you need to pay attention when buying a facebook template?  Of course, on its structure and on how adding or editing content is implemented in the template.  After all, the first thing you do after purchasing and installing it is adding your own information.  In this regard, all facebook templates can be divided into three groups. <br><br>  The first group is the worst option for this non-understanding people.  To edit such pages, you must have source files (if this is a template on a flash, you need fla files and knowledge of how to work with them), since the information in the template is stored there.  In this case, the buyer may experience some problems (namely, software and, as I said before, the ability to work with him). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5590a7da/ab0be949/549d04d9/9aef336a.jpg"><br><br>  The second group of templates is XML templates.  The name speaks for itself.  All information is stored in a single file, for the editing of which special knowledge is not needed and practically anyone can understand it, even if it does not understand anything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/071933c8/297702ca/acbd8649/5c1925e1.jpg"><br><br>  The third group is facebook templates with admin panel.  To edit these templates, special knowledge is not needed and this is the most convenient option for the buyer.  But the price of these templates at times differs from XML templates!  And I will not even compare with the first group of templates! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0257dff5/07ccf10d/def7988e/012a1c30.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, templates that use modern CMS (content management system) as adminpanel now began to appear.  Basically it is Drupal and Wordpress.  By the way, on fanFBMLtemplates, about which I wrote above, there are cool templates with a drupal admin panel. <br><br>  In general, I think that initial knowledge is enough to buy facebook templates.  If you have something to add - welcome in the comments. <br><br>  Just want to hear feedback on those resources, which are described in the article. <br><br>  Thanks for attention.  Enjoy! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134244/</a></p>
