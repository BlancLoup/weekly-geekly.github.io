During this time, we could nashtampovat reviews about all models of electric bikes sold by us, but still preferred quality rather than quantity.  That is why they only managed to tell you about two new and interesting electric bicycles - about the budget <a href="https://habr.com/company/maccentre/blog/414381/">Airwheel R8</a> with scooter mode and carbon <a href="https://habr.com/company/maccentre/blog/422371/">Twitter TW-E9L</a> .  And now tell you about the third. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/maccentre/blog/424265/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ff/666/52c/4ff66652caded74ca879bc84fa4a147a.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Before telling something, we decided to arrange for each of the greats a long test drive;  to experience it personally - not just to drive on the asphalt around the office as others do, but right to the conscience, ‚Äúin the tail and in the mane‚Äù.  Hundreds of kilometers of asphalt, earth, sand and gravel;  ups and downs, corns and abrasions, thousands of passing cars, dozens of stray dogs and midges flying into their mouths, cubic meters of fresh air and city dust - all this and much more helped us better understand not only our products, but also electric bikes as a class (although To electric transport is no stranger). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/967/c7d/a97/967c7da971138852c5301a0706720089.jpg">

    <h2>  Appearance and design nuances </h2><br>  The production of bicycles under the brand Twitter is engaged in the company Shenzhen First Technology Co.  It all started in August 2012 and since then the company has managed to get a decent hand in matters of cycling - the company's arsenal is updated annually with dozens of models, including electric bicycles.  In its products, the company uses the products of the well-known Shimano brand (important components such as brakes and transmission are taken from it) and the less well-known Retrospec (produces various parts and bicycle accessories: steering beams, bushings, connecting rods, saddles, carriages, rims, etc.). <br><br>  It would be strange to talk about ordinary bicycles on Habr√©, but there are many electric bicycles in the company's arsenal, which are much more technologically advanced than usual - this is much more interesting.  Today our guest is Twitter Twitter Mantis E-1 is a typical MTB bike.  Well, more precisely, an electric bike - the battery between the pipe frames immediately gives out a bit of super power.  We will talk about them! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e59/4a2/4b4/e594a24b4577ba25f4d85c536321c16e.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Frame </h3><br>  Let's take a close look at the photo frame Mantis E-1.  What attracts attention?  ‚Äú <i>So ... well, a full-sized men's frame, a thin top tube, thin feathers ... um, where are the welds?</i>  <i>Yeah, carbon again?</i>  <i>Brake cable passes through the tube frame - just carbon!</i>  <i>Well, of course, again expensive carbon fiber ashchanbike, wrap it back!</i>  ". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd4/c37/003/dd4c37003dcff324078524cfc757cdd5.jpg"><br><br>  But never once carbon.  Unlike its ‚Äúolder‚Äù (including the price) Twitter brother TW-E9L from the previous <a href="https://habr.com/company/maccentre/blog/422371/">review</a> , the Mantis E-1 Twitter frame is made of aluminum.  But there are no seams because aluminum pipes are reliably interconnected by seamless welding, as a result of which everything looks expensive-rich and without sacrificing strength. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25d/132/ab9/25d132ab9421c3f4fbf3f9dba12f24d2.jpg"><br><br>  Frame size - 15.5 "or 17" (as in the review).  The upper and lower tubes of the frame have a triangular cross-section (with rounded corners), the seat tube is round.  But how neatly turned junction nodes!  It seems that this is a rare case when designers have found a common language with engineers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18e/0cd/aea/18e0cdaea284197af216d2a6d3e05cc2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c61/c39/e70/c61c39e7002e5f2106a164d43ec99e36.jpg"><br><br>  Although there are still seams in the carriage knot - it is harder to call them neat, but no one will look there anyway :) The carriage knot itself is located rather low, which is why an assault on some obstacles can take place with an unpleasant sound :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/467/1a2/62e/4671a262e2f194e440d0346a211cb35e.jpg"><br><br>  Cables running through the top tube are a common occurrence, quite practical in everyday use and more aesthetically attractive than fastening through clamps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/326/3f8/1e4/3263f81e4cf6ce5da8aa2bcee93b058f.jpg"><br><br>  The rear right feather is not deprived of a disadvantage typical for multi-speed bicycles - contact with the chain (on the smallest rear stars) on the bumps.  Therefore, it would be reasonable to wrap it with tape or buy a special protective cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe8/132/9d4/fe81329d48b0972a9397d111079ad542.jpg"><br><br>  The frame is painted in matt black with red embossed patches that can optionally be of a different color: yellow or gray.  All three combinations look great. <br><br><h3>  Engine and battery </h3><br>  Well, if we have an electric bike and a battery here, we cannot but notice, then let's look at the motor.  In the TW-E9L Twitter model, it was hidden in the carriage knot, which is why the bike did not betray any superpowers.  In Twitter, the Mantis E-1 is a more traditional approach - the electric motor is in the rear wheel and looks like a fat bushing :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b9/ee7/228/1b9ee7228553195c17877d2403c95acd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b5/fad/c8e/6b5fadc8e70b901b2de008a2146256a7.jpg"><br><br>  Perhaps the key characteristic of the motor is its power and in this respect the Mantis E-1 is not bad.  The engine's rated power is 350 watts, or about half the horsepower (736 watts).  It turns out that this is already officially a moped, since it does not fit the traffic regulations (up to 250 W) (it will not fit into them again in a couple of paragraphs): <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  "A bicycle is a vehicle, other than wheelchairs, which has at least two wheels and is driven, as a rule, by the muscular energy of persons on this vehicle, in particular with the help of pedals or handles, and may also have an electric motor with a rated maximum power continuous duty mode, not exceeding 0.25 kW, automatically shutting down at a speed exceeding 25 km / h. " </td></tr></tbody></table>  The brushless motor (gear motor-wheel), designed for a voltage of 36 V. Inside it is a planetary gearbox, which develops up to 60 N ¬∑ m output torque.  The gearbox has a free-wheeling clutch, thanks to which the wheel can rotate freely at idle (with fairly quiet crackling, unlike the same TW-E9L).  When the motor does not work, the clutch mechanically opens the clutch with the gearbox so that its gears do not spin and do not impede the rotation of the wheel.  From here two conclusions: 1) roll forward is better 2) recovery here is impossible. <br><br>  The second component of the power plant is a lithium-ion battery from LG, located on the frame.  Its capacity is 468 W ¬∑ h (36 V, 13 A ¬∑ h; configuration 10S4P - 10 consecutive blocks of 4 parallel 18650-elements) and from one charge it provides a fairly large power reserve - up to 120 km in the help mode. <br><br>  Compared to the same TW-E9L, the Mantis E-1 battery pack has several advantages: <br><br><ul><li>  It is removable (and not integrated into the frame), which means it can be removed - to charge at home, not to get stuck and to use as a large paverbank :) Well, for winter storage it is a more practical option. </li><li>  You can use several blocks for greater autonomy - in case you are ripe for the Around the World.  This is also the possibility of self-replacement of the battery in the event of a breakdown. </li></ul><br>  The battery is removable, but just so any pioneer can not do this: you need a key, which comes with two pieces, complete with a bicycle.  After turning the key, the battery on the rail rises and is removed.  Everything is going in the reverse order: the battery slides along the rail and is locked with a key. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8dd/b61/699/8ddb61699a4fcbbe5cb3709746c1aaa7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kc/pt/hz/kcpthzbijs26ftaitanpkxzzxg0.jpeg"><br><br>  A few observations: <br><br><ul><li>  The battery pack is connected to the bike with only two contacts (for power transmission), all the ‚Äúbrains‚Äù (the controller for controlling the motor-wheel) are located in the compartment under the battery - an excellent constructive solution. </li><li>  The electrician looks protected, so it is unlikely that there will be anything from the rain (although it is not recommended to ride the rain in the instructions). </li></ul><br>  In addition to the lock, there are several other functional elements in the battery: <br><br><ul><li>  On the left is a charge indicator of several LEDs, which is activated by a button. </li><li>  On the right is a triangular rubber plug, behind which there is a charging connector, a USB port and a red switch that disconnects the entire electrics of the bike from the battery. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4cf/701/f55/4cf701f55717ef5646465de71ac27722.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e91/869/a74/e91869a74bcf35c2770abd245804c814.jpg"><br><br>  The USB port is useful for anything, from the most trivial - charging a smartphone when Strava finishes the last charge of a long trip.  As an option - to power the action-camera or a column that can be hung on the steering wheel, for example.  Well, or a flashlight, although it is unlikely.  Yes, anything - the main thing is to choose the right L-shaped wiring to reduce the likelihood of damage (wires, battery pack and legs). <br><br>  By the way, the charger that comes with the bike deserves special attention.  At the output, it produces a current of 2 A (that is, charging a completely discharged battery can take 6‚Äì7 hours) and usually these chargers get very hot.  But here the fan is integrated into the adapter, which solves the problem of overheating.  True, you will not see it, because you forgot to take a picture :) <br><br>  A pleasant nuance: despite the presence of the engine and battery, the weight is about 18 kg.  If you want to ride "honestly", then the battery can be removed (it weighs 2.6 kg), but then the screen will not work. <br><br>  Pleasant nuance 2: the battery has left some space for a stretcher bag.  Twitter TW-E9L doesn‚Äôt have one, because there is no upper frame tube. <br><br><h3>  Fork </h3><br>  Well, everything is simple here: a caring air-oil plug with the possibility of complete blocking acts as a shock absorber.  Like the frame, the plug is painted matt black. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31d/8b6/fba/31d8b6fba9cc444db23a14576457d162.jpg"><br><br>  The damper regulator is located in the upper part of the right ‚Äúleg‚Äù.  In the open state, the depreciation works (in this mode it is softer on off-road, the course is up to 110 mm), turning the knob in the direction of the closed lock icon ‚Äúcloses‚Äù the shock absorber up to a complete blockage (it is easier to accelerate and roll up better). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1f/4d6/45c/d1f4d645ced27c0ece897877ca396ef6.jpg"><br><br>  The rear suspension shock absorber was not delivered to this model, but if you are willing to pay for extra comfort on the bumps, then here's your <a href="http://twitter-bikes.ru/product/am26-e1">dummy Twitter AM26-E1</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b7/c17/c97/6b7c17c9795b90f79d310c5e343dfbae.jpg"><br><h3>  Brake system </h3><br>  ‚ÄúAwesome!‚Äù Is a word to describe the effectiveness and sensations when braking.  And all because there is a semi-professional Shimano SLX brake system (or rather the SLX BR-M7000), about which you can find megabytes of positive reviews on the network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/64b/2e1/288/64b2e1288780c700e4ba778dc539e574.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/765/775/d40/765775d4033c6a53ab2cdca2977b8166.jpg"><br><br>  First, the hydraulic brake system (running on mineral oil), and therefore does not require constant maintenance and adjustments.  Secondly, paired with it are (front and rear) brake discs with a diameter of 160 mm, which, if necessary, two-piston calipers clamped with a dead grip.  Due to this, the wear of the pads is uniform, which means you can forget about them for a long time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b5a/b12/c1a/b5ab12c1a9543be1af4d71d71d9bb114.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52f/73a/5b1/52f73a5b189ac26b0a59a3e8aea56b09.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/905/d39/1bb/905d391bbb6b6ae7c1642dd84db60e83.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75f/bf9/c62/75fbf9c62d7b2c34bf09cea374868076.jpg"><br><br>  To ‚Äúhang on the belts‚Äù you need to gently press at least one brake with at least one finger. <br><br><h3>  Wheels, pedals and saddle </h3><br>  The electric motor in the Mantis E-1 does not assume the power function of the cyclist, so you still have to turn the pedals.  For this, the manufacturer has set up a rather interesting combined solution from Shimano: on the one hand, each pedal has a familiar ‚Äútamper‚Äù, and on the other hand, a clip for contact shoes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c7/af0/f18/6c7af0f18da51c19c4c4694c0fae0066.jpg"><br><br>  Moreover, the plastic part of the "tamer" can be removed and then the contact pedal will be on both sides.  This will allow the most effective development of pedal cravings (using not only moving the legs down, but also upwards) to rotate the pedals, but also require the use of special shoes from the cyclist.  But if you drive in ordinary sneakers, then yes, this option will not be very convenient: you will have to check all the time that the pedal is turned by the right side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/495/0c9/f6f/4950c9f6f118114bbc509bd43b46e801.jpg"><br><br>  Anyway, pedals can be replaced at any time with those that are more like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f13/78a/35e/f1378a35ed47e4e68c2baff9df198164.jpg"><br><br>  Wheels - 26-inch, with universal cross-country tires MAXXIS PACE (width 1.95 "), Retrospec rims and piston spokes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da7/4aa/6e8/da74aa6e8da4659284fca9f4e33c71a7.jpg"><br><br>  The tread pattern is not very evil, but it allows you to climb curbs with confidence and enter turns in speed even on unpaved tracks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10f/025/553/10f0255537cf03d99828e3d44d38cfd0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1be/670/565/1be67056569a5fad139ee9fdd4f771c4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d7/ac4/7ac/1d7ac47ac5c04bd8e730a44eddb02550.jpg"><br><br>  The saddle is standard for MTB, from Retrospec - narrow and rigid, made of artificial leather.  Adjustable for reach and tilt, the seatpost provides a 15-centimeter range for height adjustment (an eccentric is used). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/657/040/d14/657040d14916fb1b6b3e9acb9fb534f1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/09a/ba5/5f8/09aba55f8432b4ea48e7e556d910657e.jpg"><br><br><h3>  The steering wheel, shifting, headlights and other body kit </h3><br>  As is the case with the saddle, the steering wheel is also typical for MTB and also from the Retrospec subbrand.  Direct, there is enough space for additional weight - both the headlight and the signal, and even something else you forgot to put in the kit will fit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/236/25c/640/23625c64070cf759e02ffe4502e468a7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/afd/a95/8cc/afda958cc5ee8aa4fc88e9e34500bb63.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2df/bbb/3eb/2dfbbb3ebfcb8aef12c4e05982321e95.jpg"><br><br>  Skin grips, smooth, without anatomical gadgets.  Pretty tough, but very comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/536/ba1/b90/536ba1b90e6ef67afc818ae3d7ffc9a9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/788/157/aec/788157aec8847200e5a53fcb03124d1b.jpg"><br><br>  For harmony with the SLX-series of brakes, the manufacturer put on an excellent SLX-series of shifters and switches: on the steering wheel on the left, control the front three stars (22-32-44T), on the right - eleven rear ones (11-36T, 11-speed cassette SUGEK-11S ; the chain is also 11-speed, YBN-11S, there is a link with a lock). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf7/567/5a4/bf75675a45497a44fb1e762ead04820a.jpg"><br><br>  Total 33 speeds that can be combined with 5 modes of motor support - this potential is enough even for the most capricious legs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c44/0ef/bc1/c440efbc1153c4b0f6690756a2e09edf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f20/eb2/7f7/f20eb27f7fd5b47cdafc07f0b0f3c5bc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c6/9f6/956/8c69f69564387780ccc84a3588f7fb21.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6cd/2e0/808/6cd2e0808cc79e2dcd39c23db4e12a94.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea3/ece/c8b/ea3ecec8b1fa2768200e4626b5c28e2d.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, there is a three-button electric motor control on the left: the up and down arrows change the level of motor assistance, and the ‚ÄúM‚Äù button <s>turns on the /// M-mode.</s> <br>  switches the data display modes or switches the on-board computer into (s), which will be described in a couple of lines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52f/fdc/d28/52ffdcd28a497037baef626b013af076.jpg"><br><br>  A separate item thanks to the manufacturer for a convenient adjustable footboard, taking pictures of the bike is much more convenient :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/86b/367/201/86b367201c95402caf82050bc89792da.jpg"><br><br><h3>  On-board computer </h3><br>  This is the third review of the electric bike - they all had different on-board computers.  And this one is probably the best.  It's not as big as Twitter's TW-E9L, but not as small as Airwheel R8.  So it can be called the golden mean. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4e8/60b/308/4e860b308e62b54f19b0ebd3800fc074.jpg"><br><br>  A rather large LCD screen is slightly recessed into the case.  Unlike the Twitter TW-E9L LCD, this one doesn't fade in the sun.  This is true - information is easily read in any conditions (there is a backlight for darkness). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f99/50e/4ce/f9950e4ce17fa7e9fc2b33de9684a2f2.jpg"><br><br>  The largest figures, at the top, display the speed - kilometers or miles per hour (up to tenths).  Minimum inertia: when stopping on the "speedometer" immediately 0. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be8/bec/be8/be8becbe862979a110043bc73a1f4553.jpg"><br><br>  The second large number, PAS (Pedal Assist System), displays the mode of support by the electric motor: from 1 (minimum) to 5 (maximum), 0 - support is turned off (and then the on-board computer simply counts the speed / mileage).  Slightly higher is the battery charge, and not only in uninformative "sticks", but also in percentages. <br><br>  The most "small print" on the screen displays the mileage: current (TRIP), total (ODO) and travel time (TIME). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52c/f94/f73/52cf94f73029efce000ca7f19d1aa005.jpg"><br><br>  But that's not all.  Each time the bike is turned on, a kind of system initialization takes place, at which all possible icons light up on the screen.  From there it is clear that: <br><br><ul><li>  It can show not only the current (CUR) speed, but also the average (AVG) and maximum (MAX) for the race; </li><li>  There are error indicators (engine / controller / battery failure); </li><li>  There is an indicator of "cruise control" (speed 6 km / h), in case you walk by the handle :) </li><li>  VOL / CUR - current battery voltage and current consumption can be displayed on the bottom line. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/531/766/202/531766202ccf399e0e992b5e5da8c526.jpg"><br><br>  For some of this data, additional sensors are needed, but even without them, this seems to be the ideal BC (if you know better, write in the comments).  If interesting, then google as Bafang S830. <br><br><hr><br>  Let's sum up about the look?  The design is beautiful and not spoiled by anything (well, except that again with a large number of Twitter inscriptions throughout the salon, but in this case it doesn't even bother you :) The combination of black and red is very beautiful, the best combination is hard to come up with. <br><br>  The main systems (brakes, transmission) are very harmonious, and some details nod towards advanced cyclists and say ‚Äútake me right now.‚Äù  Let's not pull the cat by the tail, drove! <br><br><h2>  Tests </h2><br>  At the beginning of this section, I would like to recall the first electric bike (AIrwheel R8), which was <a href="https://habr.com/company/maccentre/blog/414381/">reviewed</a> in our blog.  Removing it from charging, the first thought in my head was something like ‚Äú <i>well, and now let's see how much is enough for you</i> ‚Äù.  Thirty in the combined cycle for one trip and everything, again on charging.  In the case of Twitter Mantis E-1, everything is different: here he says ‚Äúclimb, see how much is enough for you‚Äù :) And all because unlike the first R8 with scooter mode, Mantis E-1 can only be in help mode, and therefore it has more power reserve (the manufacturer claims 120 km). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/411/62d/250/41162d250f485366439ea69373f7e2bc.jpg"><br><br>  This time, there were no falls, which personally makes me happy :) But another problem arose: the electric bike's power reserve turned out to be unusually large, that the unprepared cyclist simply wouldn't be able to defuse the bike in one go - the rolls would be rubbed :) We had to discharge it in several iterations, but taking In the hands of a calculator, a total of about 130-140 km <s>characters were</s> counted on a single charge.  The value is very dirty, because there were different types of roads, support levels and even cyclists, but still great 120. <br><br>  If you drive with the battery removed or turned off, then riding a Mantis E-1 is no different from riding a classic MTB bike on a pedal gear: it looks equally good both on smooth city lanes and in clumsy potholes, which is native to it the element. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac6/6d2/e3c/ac66d2e3c8e8ec4e7ac95eb589200c5a.jpg"><br><br>  But it is necessary to press the red button on the battery and keep the ‚ÄúM‚Äù on the steering wheel ... as it remains to choose one of five levels of support and start driving.  If nothing is selected, there will be no support, just the screen will show the current telemetry. <br><br>  For some reason, many people think that once an electric bike, then nothing needs to be done - he sat on it and he took you.  Alas, ah, although it is nice to ride like that.  But Twitter Mantis E-1 cannot ride in scooter mode, as Airwheel R8 could - this is the main disappointment of those who asked to take a ride hoping to feel a miracle :) But still managed to make friends happy, because even just a support mode causes pleasant emotions, giving a sort of boost. <br><br>  The bike is equipped with a pedal sensor (PAS - Pedal Assist System), which detects the fact of pedaling and turns on the motor if at least one turn is made (and if the speed is lower than the limit for the specified level of assistant assistance).  Hence the first conclusion: the bike will not allow "jerk" from the spot, if you have not done at least one turn - it can be difficult to effectively drive up the hill on a heavy asterisk.  The second conclusion: the motor is either working or not - if you pedal constantly, then the motor will work constantly.  But at the same time, he is not able to understand when you need help and how to render it correctly: when you twist the pedals idle or when groaning up the hill - he will help to pedal in both cases, because his only setting is the chosen level of help.  A similar system is installed on most electric bicycles, and rightly so: if you like to ride, love and twist the pedals. <br><br>  Simply put, the engine in the Mantis E-1 works in tandem with the cyclist, but does not take its function completely, just as the PAS does not remove such an important function from the cyclist as choosing the right gear.  So we have here, rather, the good old "mechanics" on steroids, rather than "automatic".  But it is quite possible to drive almost for a halyavka - if you put maximum support and rotate the pedals on a comfortable pair of stars (in the 5th mode, even the heaviest star seems quite easy).  If at the speed we begin to pedal intensively, the speed will not change much, but the current consumption will decrease (as can be seen on the computer screen). <br><br>  The electric motor has interesting features. <br><br>  First, when it works, it makes a not very loud, but rather unusual sound - very similar to the sound of an angry cat :) Here, from the 30th second, the cat works on electric :) If you go in headphones (I remind you that it is not safe) ), the fact of the inclusion of an assistant is felt by a small boost and a decrease in the load on the legs. <br><br>  Secondly, the electric motor stops working at speeds in excess of 35 km / h (and this is the second reason why Twitter Mantis E-1 does not fit the term ‚Äúbicycle‚Äù from the traffic rules).  The maximum power of the battery gives at speeds from 20 to 25 km / h, while the battery current is about 10 A. With a further increase in speed, the current begins to gradually decrease - at a speed of 35 km / h, it drops to 2 A and then to zero.  That is, if you drive 40 km / h and think that this is all an electric motor, then no - it is you who work, and he is already resting :) By the way, my record for Mantis E-1 was 65.5 km / h from the hill locked fork. <br><br>  The third interesting feature <a href="https://www.ixbt.com/live/car/smart-bayk-twitter-mantis-e1-usilitel-velosipedista.html">was noticed</a> in the review on IXBT: <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>The riddle of a long battery charge reading of 100% was solved.</i>  <i>By observing the battery voltage, we managed to find out that the voltage on the battery was 39 V for 100%. And since the battery charges to 41.7 V, until the voltage drops to 39 V, the indicator shows 100%.</i>  <i>In subsequent races, it was possible to determine the voltage that was taken on the bike for zero charge - it is 30 V exactly.</i>  <i>Moreover, when the voltage drops below this value, the controller reduces the power at the motor very quickly: already at 29.5 V, the current becomes zero.</i>  <i>In other words, for the controller, the health of the battery is more important than the health of the rider :)</i> " <br><br>  By the way, they also did not manage to defuse the bike in one race, but the result was also more than the manufacturer claims - 152 km. <br><br><h2>  Technical specifications <a href="http://twitter-bikes.ru/product/mantis-e1">Twitter Mantis E-1</a>

Friends, we also had a childhood, between our legs were the same "Schoolchildren", "Tair", "Salutes" and other two-wheeled pieces of iron, where there was only one speed and had to sweat a little while working with our feet. And yes, it was awesome! But everything is changing - over the past decades, everything has changed in the design of bicycles. And despite the progress, a certain limit was nevertheless reached: a certain set of items assembled at a time allowed the average user to travel a very limited distance (for each his own, depending on the physical form and the details themselves). Every bike owner knew about his limit: how much he could drive in one race, how many kilometers the backside flared up,at what intensity of pedal rotation will even the AX Effect stop rescuing.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, electric bikes are nothing more than the next step in the evolution of light two-wheeled vehicles, which it is time to accept for a long time, and not to look for flaws in them. Electric bicycles have done nothing bad to anyone, although they already have two important points on the list of good things: 1) they have increased the distance several times, which can be driven at a time, and 2) raised the level of comfort to a higher level. All this made it possible to use one of the coolest means of transport even more effectively and efficiently: to drive faster and farther, to sweat less and to charge some kind of gadget along the way. And it is not clear why someone calls it cheating; especially against the background of the fact that nothing in electric bikes (NOTHING at all) does not interfere with pedaling only by muscular strength. After all, no one calls cheating, for example, exoskeletons,who are developing many companies around the world ... Therefore, whoever says anything there, and electric bikes will only gain momentum in the foreseeable future. As well as electric cars, but this is a longer process and a topic for another conversation.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you want to buy an electric bike, then we recommend not to postpone and do it right now: at the end of the season. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We can - we have a lot of cool and already brought bikes, which we can sell at the ‚Äúold rate‚Äù and at a discount. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, next year there will be something new, but before the season the same purchase will definitely come out more expensive.</font></font><br><br>  Successes! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/424265/">https://habr.com/ru/post/424265/</a></p>
