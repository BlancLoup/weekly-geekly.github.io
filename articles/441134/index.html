      Internal sensations that generate desires are called emotions.  Emotions affect performance by helping or interfering.  The study of emotions is a useful thing, to say the least. <br><br>  Enumeration of different emotions can be found in different habro-hubs, for example: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337352/">Personnel Management</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425153/">Scientific-Popular</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418151/">Machine Learning</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/332466/">Image Processing</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203264/">Testing IT-systems</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246509/">Website Development</a> . <br><br>  The mention of individual emotions can be found in almost any living hub.  Emotions are important, aren't they?  It seems that the important topic is well studied. <br><br>  Allow me to doubt. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Blurred term </h3><br>  Many people speak confidently about emotions, write articles and whole books on managing their own and other people's experiences. <br><br>  Suddenly, Wikipedia notices that <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">emotions</a> , like many other mental phenomena, are poorly understood and understood by different authors differently, so any definition cannot be considered neither accurate nor generally accepted. <br><br>  In recent decades, the number of studies has increased significantly (thanks to applied problems), but there is still no agreement between scientists (there is currently no scientific consensus on a definition). <br><br>  Of course, not only Wikipedia indicates a problem.  And on Habr√©, the problem of lack of consensus was voiced more than once. <br><br>  For example, the author of the book ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/353816/">The Emotion Machine</a> ‚Äù Marvin Minsky notes that the attempts of psychologists to give a clear definition of words more prevented than helped to create theories about how our brain works. <br><br>  For example, the author of the book ‚ÄúHow emotions are created: the secret life of the brain,‚Äù Lisa Feldman Barrett, suggests once again <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/406911/">reviewing knowledge about emotions</a> . <br><br>  An important topic has been poorly studied, which over the centuries has accumulated dozens of theories for every taste ... It sounds strange, indicating the existence of a fundamental problem. <br><br>  The fundamental problem of "emotions" in uncertainty, the vagueness of the term - trying to put too different entities under one word.  Excessive generalization does not give a single chance to attempt to combine research results and give general recommendations. <br><br>  The word "emotion" is difficult to identify, even with the explanatory dictionary.  And the more dictionaries to take, the more questions arise.  Emotions are surely mixed with feelings, states, desires, affects. <br><br>  Emotions are processes in the body, conscious experiences, facial expressions, and disguises for instincts.  There are no clear boundaries. <br><br>  I tried to clear the term and reassemble the list of emotions. <br><br>  Emotions are felt inside, indicate the inner state of a person, and not the property of the surrounding world.  Latin ‚Äúemoveo‚Äù - to accelerate, raise, shake.  Somewhere nearby are ‚Äúmoto‚Äù and ‚Äúmoveo‚Äù - move.  The word itself hints that emotion is felt as an internal movement.  At the same time, emotion motivates, inclines to action, prompts to change behavior. <br><br>  Emotion is a motivating arousal or a stimulating state.  This definition allows you to put aside most of the sensations and moods, filter out reactions and manifestations. <br><br>  After trying to clarify the term, I received a list of emotions, which is not like popular lists, retold in many articles.  If you choose a list of emotions for a regular article on the subject of machine learning or personnel management, then from dozens of options do you choose the most suitable one for the task or do you take the cutest known one? <br><br>  And when considering individual emotions, I found the same problem of vagueness of terms.  If you write about anxiety, fear, anger or happiness, what exactly do you mean?  Everyone knows and understands, yes, but there is a problem - not everyone understands the same. <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%258C_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">The dictionary of emotions</a> contains 227 articles that are useful to read for the development of emotional intelligence.  But the dictionary gives different names for similar experiences or their combinations, different reasons or circumstances of occurrence. <br><br>  A variety of names helps to see the wealth of the world, but the words are secondary.  If emotions are sensations, then I suggest taking a break from names and focus on sensations to shorten the list, look for patterns and just practice EQ. <br><br>  If you wish to correct or add, then welcome. <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441134/">Paired</a> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441134/">Appetite and aversion (metabolism)</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441134/">Pride and shame (modeling, forecast)</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441134/">Acceptance and rejection (evaluation)</a> </li></ul><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441134/">Unpleasant</a> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441134/">Anxiety (waiting, incompleteness, attention)</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441134/">Fear (freezing, ignorance, confusion)</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441134/">Irritation (pressure, anger, reproaches, boredom)</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441134/">Sadness (humility, crying, annoyance)</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441134/">Fatigue (inhibition, drowsiness)</a> </li></ul><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441134/">Pleasant</a> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441134/">Anticipation (promise, advertising)</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441134/">Passion (action, travel)</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441134/">Achievement (relaxation, laughter)</a> </li></ul><br><br>  If you want to skip the verbosity of reasoning, you can immediately proceed to the listing of <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441134/">popular lists</a> . <br><br><a name="10"></a><br><h3>  Paired </h3><br>  Information is easier to perceive when the two ends of the scale, opposites, dichotomy are visible.  It is easier to notice the emotions that exist in pairs. <br><br>  Any association in this list is conditional, not related to neuroscience.  Even if emotions are gathered in a pair, their work is provided by different parts of the brain. <br><br><a name="11"></a><br><h4>  Appetite and aversion (metabolism) </h4><br>  Appetite is not usually attributed to emotions, but the fact is that appetite is felt and influences behavior.  When the digestive system feels the lack of some substances, it increases the attractiveness of objects that are remembered as a source of the missing. <br><br>  The same applies to the opposite emotion - if the experience of digestion indicates a chance of poisoning, unpleasant sensations are sent to the top.  Trouble subconscious leads to bypass the danger side. <br><br>  Civilization gave a variety of dishes, abundance and food safety.  Purse and advertising determine the attractiveness of food.  Nutrition is used to set the mood.  Appetite and aversion lose the meaning invested in them by evolution.  Appetite is confused with hunger.  Disgust is called other emotions, not related to metabolism. <br><br>  Theoretically, one could add ‚Äúhunger‚Äù and ‚Äúsatiety‚Äù to the list of paired emotions, but personally I find it difficult to describe how they are felt.  If you separate appetite from hunger, then what is hunger, in addition to unpleasant sensations, which are not related to emotions, but to digestive problems?  And if you separate the severity, drowsiness and contentment, then what of the sensations will remain the share of satiety?  In my opinion, ‚Äúhunger‚Äù and ‚Äúsatiety‚Äù are not emotions, but states or evaluations. <br><br>  If you do not focus on food during meals, the digestive system is confused.  If you grab some unpleasant news while you eat, discuss working problems, listen to parents' instructions, or teach children, your body may find food in search of the source of the problem.  And if the unpleasant association is fixed at the level of the immune system, then there will be a reason to think about the causes of allergies.  However, this is another story. <br><br><a name="12"></a><br><h4>  Pride and shame (modeling, forecast) </h4><br>  The floor above is a social carrot and stick - shame and pride.  Shame is intended to stop.  Pride draws winning pictures, offering repeat success. <br><br>  Appetite and aversion relate to external objects that can get into the stomach.  Pride and shame belong not to objects, but to positions and actions. <br><br>  And not necessarily mine - I can worry about the actions or appearance of people close to me.  It turns out that I consider them part of my inner world and try to control others, as if part of myself.  Or feel dependent on circumstances or other people's actions, not independent, weak.  Or show healthy empathy.  Possible options. <br><br>  Sometimes shame and pride mutate - turns into an assessment of people.  Hanging labels helps to simplify the picture of the world, but excessive simplification is fraught with errors.  Hasty conclusions do not always benefit. <br><br>  If you become ashamed of yourself or someone, you urgently need to remember that the feeling of shame relates only to the act, and only in a particular situation.  Even repeated mistakes in actions are not human qualities.  The reverse is also true - even significant achievements do not make a person a role model.  When raising children, it should be remembered that the child is not his mistakes and not his achievements. <br><br>  When shame or pride goes wild, interfere with thinking and acting, the general rule of all emotions can help - if you listen to your inner feelings, stay with emotion, stop thinking about what is happening outside, the emotion calms down.  It reminds a signal about an unread message, which disappears when the message is read. <br><br>  The message comes from the depths of the unconscious.  Sometimes beliefs sitting in the subconscious mind are not satisfied with thoughts that sound at the level of consciousness and want to influence what is happening.  There is a signal from the subconscious level to the level of consciousness - hey, up there, you're wrong, stop come on.  Or - it was cool, repeat.  The sooner we agree to read this signal and understand what it refers to, the sooner the signal will subside. <br><br>  It is not necessary to obey signals, the subconscious mind can also be mistaken, beliefs can change.  It is only important to agree with the existence of the signal - emotions.  Stop looking for inner sensations in the world around you.  Then the internal components of the human ‚ÄúI‚Äù see each other and can start a dialogue.  And calmly resolve any internal disputes. <br><br>  It should be noted that the skills of prevention, recognition, awareness, living and getting out of unpleasant experiences with minimal losses are very different, but extremely important skills.  Accordingly, in order to cope with unpleasant emotions, it is possible and even necessary to use different approaches, not limited to popular advices to ‚Äúrestrain‚Äù, ‚Äúovercome‚Äù or ‚Äúsplash out‚Äù. <br><br><a name="13"></a><br><h4>  Acceptance and rejection (evaluation) </h4><br>  Appetite and aversion are tied to the metabolism.  Pride and shame are tied to modeling relationships.  The third pair of acceptance and rejection lives above the assessment mechanism, so it can relate to anything - objects, people, phenomena, thoughts, time spans, etc. <br><br>  Acceptance and rejection are found in different areas of life.  The boundaries between paired emotions are blurred: an attractive person wants to bite, a well-designed dish is pride, bad actions look disgusting.  Words can be confused. <br><br>  For acceptance, the words ‚Äúlike‚Äù or ‚Äúnice‚Äù are used, although this is incorrectly etymologically, and in Russian the passive voice contributes to the loss of the subject of the action.  ‚ÄúLove‚Äù still fits, but the poets have scouted this word.  Strong acceptance is sometimes called admiration and delight. <br><br>  The rarity of the pleasant can turn into dependence - I want to repeat, it‚Äôs terrible to lose access to the source.  The roots of jealousy are drawn from here. <br><br>  Feelings of acceptance - I want to interact, my mood improves. <br><br>  Feelings of rejection - I want to leave or push away, the mood spoils. <br><br>  Strong rejection can generate other emotions.  For example, rejection can cause anger and hide behind it. <br><br>  Habitual rejection in psychology is called idiosyncrasy and is accumulated in relation to a person, occupation or subject with which unpleasant experiences are connected.  To dispel unpleasant habits in evaluative emotions, a technique of programming <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/439082/">evaluations</a> is suitable. <br><br>  Emotions are also pleasant and unpleasant - we try to avoid unpleasant feelings and want to meet pleasant ones more often. <br><br>  Attempts to get away from unpleasant experiences are fraught with error, the signals must be taken, whatever they may seem.  And the pursuit of pleasant experiences can give rise to a mistake - if the tool ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù has become the goal of life, then more realistic goals lose priority.  Pleasure is not more important than anything noted in the list of basic <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/439082/">needs</a> . <br><br><a name="20"></a><br><h3>  Unpleasant </h3><br>  From paired emotions turn to separate sensations.  Not all emotions have the opposite side. <br><br><a name="21"></a><br><h4>  Anxiety (waiting, incompleteness, attention) </h4><br>  Anxiety is similar to internal stress.  You can feel anxious and impossible to feel calm.  Calm is a term for the absence of anxiety, a state of relaxation. <br><br>  The essence of anxiety - attracting attention.  If what is expected for a long time may come into view, it is very important not to miss it.  Do not oversleep, listen, look - day after day.  If there are many alarms, then attention is not enough for other things, it is difficult to concentrate on current tasks. <br><br>  Anxiety can apply not only to dangerous events.  Perhaps the tense expectation of good news, an occasion to explode with joy.  Anxiety may be accompanied by a pleasant anticipation.  But by itself, prolonged stress is not pleasant. <br><br>  In talking about desires, I talked about the dangers of <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/439082/">hope</a> ‚Äî expectations generate anxiety.  While I wait, I am an object depending on the circumstances, not a subject.  Loss of control increases anxiety. <br><br>  The subject is recommended to strengthen his subjectivity, to work on strengthening the "I", the self, the ego.  And also practice ‚Äúreturning in here and now‚Äù - from virtual worlds with improved conditions that are drawn in dreams.  The more pleasantly invented, the more unpleasant the real - this is a bad road.  It's nice to walk in the land of fantasy, but surrogates should not force out real joys. <br><br>  In addition to expectations, you can increase anxiety by banning the usual compensation.  If something is not pleasant, causes unpleasant feelings, but it is impossible to get rid of it, then there is a desire to improve mood, to compensate unpleasant with something pleasant.  Candy, cigarettes, pictures of cute animals on the Internet - compensation can be very different. <br><br>  If there are too many compensations, if they take health or too much time, then we call them bad habits and start overcoming them.  But with the deprivation of access to the usual compensations, the subconscious mind does not calm down, continues to seek out in the surrounding world other known ways to improve the mood.  He tries to draw attention to what he found, includes anxiety. <br><br>  For example, the forced rejection of computer games, social networks, e-mail and telephones leads to an unpleasant condition, which they began to call ‚Äúdigital alarm‚Äù. <br><br>  Also, the source of anxiety can be an abundance of unclosed tasks.  If at work you have to do dozens of different things at the same time, solve problems with school, repairs, neighbors, on the road behind the wheel, track not only difficult situations, but also phone calls, plus keep some promising future plans in mind, then each other‚Äôs thoughts interrupt friend, attention jumps from task to task, struggling not to lose, not to forget even the most important thing from a long list. <br><br>  And even one important unclosed task can lead to a state of alarm.  Now it is impossible to solve, but the problem is so important that the subconscious mind diligently searches for everything that at least approximately can be useful for the solution. <br><br>  Such a situation is especially unpleasant when the old problem does not appear at the level of consciousness.  Long rejection generates a filter, the desire to remember and notice disappears.  No problems are visible, and anxiety is not appeased - such ambiguity can create phobias, an artificial fear of randomly selected entities that can justify unpleasant sensations.  It does not matter, it is spiders or monsters under the bed. <br><br>  Anxiety is manifested not only by deterioration of mood or unpleasant sensations.  A more pronounced symptom is attention deficit.  The focus of attention is twitching, it cannot linger for long on anything.  The subconscious constantly pulls back, trying to draw attention to something else. <br><br>  Now it is fashionable for restless children to diagnose ADHD - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Perhaps, in the future, they will learn how to treat the problem not with medications, but with deliverance of children from reasons to worry.  Or, finally, recognize the right of children to restlessness. <br><br>  Knowledge workers also often lack attention.  Scientists and engineers keep complex abstract constructions in mind, and attention is focused on modeling moving systems.  Therefore, they tend to become nervous.  They do not like being often distracted from work.  The very possibility of distraction turns into anxiety, which takes away the forces necessary for work.  If the term ‚Äúprocrastination‚Äù is familiar and meaningful for someone, it will not hurt to check the level of anxiety. <br><br>  Another symptom of anxiety is the narrowing of the planning horizon.  Tired of jumping attention is no longer trying to look ahead for a long time.  He tries to plan from his last efforts at least the next hours.  And upset in advance because of the complexity of the problem, an excess of unpredictable factors. <br><br>  If there is no work plan in mind for the next few years, or at least a month, if it is difficult to focus on the current work task, then we can assume a lack of attention.  If the lack of attention worries, then we can assume the presence of an excess of anxiety. <br><br>  If anxieties are triggered by hopes, then you can work on strengthening your self and returning to reality.  If anxiety is caused by a lack of compensation, then you need to look for a source of discomfort and work on eliminating it, and not endlessly trying to drown out your discomfort. <br><br>  If anxiety is caused by an excess of unclosed tasks, then you need to learn how to defer all that can be deferred.  If there is an unpleasant, but still unsolved, long-standing question, then it is better to collect and devote strength to its solution.  Until he poisoned the future with endless anxieties.  Or, at least, write down the problem on paper, which is attached in a prominent place - the signals of emotions must be taken, and not jammed. <br><br><a name="22"></a><br><h4>  Fear (freezing, ignorance, confusion) </h4><br>  You can feel the fear and you can not feel the courage.  By courage is the ability to ignore or overcome fear.  But overcoming is a concomitant experience, not the opposite. <br><br>  Curiosity can also be considered as overcoming fear, children who have climbed into a dark basement will confirm.  It will be curious to compare courage with curiosity at leisure.  And with wariness. <br><br>  For courage, they take an exhilarating sensation when adrenaline is released, but adrenaline helps to escape too. <br><br>  Running away in the ‚Äúhit or run‚Äù reaction is not fear, but the simplest choice plus chemistry of mobilization.  The reaction can also be called an emotion, a vague term will not object, but what will it help? <br><br>  Alcoholic drinks are said to give courage, but in reality they only dull attention and logic, making it easier to ignore the dangers. <br><br>  Love testifies to the absence of fears.  However, the vague term ‚Äúlove‚Äù is understood differently by different people.  And the absence of fear is not yet courage. <br><br>  I did not find courage in a series of sensations.  Courage and cowardice are not feelings, but assessments of danger and actions. <br><br>  Fear is felt as cold and squeezing in the stomach.  The tension spreads even on the surface of the head, so the hair stands on end.  Muscles are prepared for action, but are locked.  Attempts to move are suppressed.  Those who read about somatic recall the red light reflex.  YouTube lovers remember goat paralysis. <br><br>  In what cases is this tension felt?  For example, when from a room where there is no one, I know for sure there was no one there, a male cough suddenly comes out.  You can not believe the memory, eyes, ears, do not know what to believe.  I cannot trust the knowledge of myself and my surroundings, the picture of the universe collapses.  The natural selection of evolution has proven that in such a situation it is better to stand still (the silence of the lambs). <br><br>  Fear and shame are similar.  And intertwined.  Shame, like other rejection, is accompanied by fear of plunge.  And fear is accompanied by shame, shame shame. <br><br>  Shame - a particular unpleasant image is in front of the eyes, the knowledge ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do that‚Äù.  Fear is a ringing emptiness in which imagination, ignorance, ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù begins to run amok. <br><br>  In fear, the skin of the face becomes white, in shame it turns red - there is a failure of the vasomotor system, only in different directions.  Perhaps this difference can tell something. <br><br>  Shame grows smoothly because it involves a complex mechanism for modeling reality.  Fear turns on instantly, because it belongs to other parts of the brain, the ancient systems of rapid response. <br><br>  And fear and shame restrain.  Both restraining emotions weaken when you gain knowledge and give yourself the right to make mistakes.  There will be no need for fear if the brain in any situation can find several options for explanations and actions. <br><br>  To gain courage, you should broaden your horizons, think about situations.  Love learning about your mistakes.  Strengthening the inner self is a universal tool. <br><br>  And also to reduce what is taken for fear, but is not fear: anxiety, hostility, predictions. <br><br>  Fear-related words are often used to mean something that is not an emotion of fear.  The expression ‚ÄúI am afraid‚Äù sometimes denotes anxiety, intense anticipation of possible troubles.  Because alarms go along with fear, anxieties can provoke the inclusion of fear, easily confused.  The principle is the same - a violation of the picture of the world.  The eyes see one around, and the alarm draws another.  No, but what if it happens? <br><br>  If there are a lot of anxieties, then attention is often forced to cross the boundaries of the real and simulated worlds, a person begins to experience a lack of attention.  Which exacerbates anxiety, which draws attention to itself, and further on. <br><br>  Lack of attention includes fear in an unexpected exit to the real world.  Unhappy people are prone to escapism, care in imaginary situations.  The more often a person goes into fantasy worlds, the more he is inclined to be frightened by harsh sounds and unexpected touches that return him to the real world. <br><br>  Anxiety can also cause a phobia.  Anxiety?  Probably, I am afraid of something, something scares, it remains to find something.  Artificial fear. <br><br>  Phobias are created by the subconscious as a tool to rationalize vague sensations.  When everything looks good in life, there is no reason for alarm at the level of consciousness, but anxiety continues to turn in the subconscious.  And the better off life, the more likely the occurrence of a phobia in response to long-standing anxiety. <br><br>  Curiously, scientists have discovered only two innate phobias: loud noises and falls from a height.  And the fear of mice, snakes, spiders or clowns has not yet been detected in the genes and reactions of newborns (an experiment with <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01710/full">pupil dilation</a> in infants is not sufficiently substantiated). <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes it is called insurance that does not refer to emotions or sensations at all. Unpleasant inferences may include anxiety, which may include fear. For example, the simulation logic gives a prediction of unpleasant consequences - I am afraid of losing money, so I do not play in the casino. Or the logic of choice gives the desire to avoid the unpleasant - I'm afraid to get wet in the rain, so I take an umbrella. The words ‚Äúfear‚Äù and ‚Äúfear‚Äù often do not refer to the emotion of fear. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When I read another article about overcoming fear, for example, public speaking, I sometimes wonder - how can I give general advice to correct something so vague?</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The same words for different processes indicate a connection between these processes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But mindless use of words can be misleading. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fleeing or avoiding is not fear, but the result of choice. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Shame, rejection, anxiety, predictions, uncertainty - they can provoke the appearance of fear, but nevertheless are independent entities, for overcoming of which we need different techniques. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To find an effective solution, you need to define a problem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To recognize the problem, it is useful to distract from vague terms and rely on sensations.</font></font><br><br><a name="23"></a><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Irritation (pressure, anger, reproaches, boredom) </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you look for the feeling of the opposite stopping fear, then I would choose stimulating emotion stimulation. For some desire, forces have been allocated, but they are not given a move. The conflict of desires, moral restrictions or fears - something blocks the implementation. The initial desire demands to allocate more forces, pressure in a copper grows. The motto of fear - I do not know what to do. The motto of irritation - do at least something. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anxiety or fear - unpleasant emotions, these signals do not want to take and do not have the strength to endure. There is a desire to somehow resolve the situation, and there is irritation.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is sometimes difficult to determine why a person is nervous, which lies at the base of unpleasant experiences ‚Äî anxieties give rise to fears that give rise to new anxieties, and all of them give rise to irritation for breaking through a way out of an unpleasant situation. The interaction of emotions is more complicated than the hodgepodge of gears on the KDPV at the beginning of the article. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Quit smoking, hungry and sleepy nervous about any reason - anxiety does not forget the need, irritation pushes to the decision. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is a term similar to irritation - anger. But is there anything in anger other than pronounced rejection? Rejection is felt as a repulsion, I want to move away from the unpleasant or to remove it from myself. And irritation feels like boiling, seething.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Excessive tension may be accompanied by tickling in the chest and trembling of the limbs. By the way, careful holding of immobility in case of negative emotions violates the program of the cardiovascular system, therefore with nervous experiences it is useful to physically move. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition to anger, anger is recorded in the list of emotions. But if you look not at traditions, but at feelings, then anger is a product of logic against the background of irritation. The rationalization of sensations is an attempt to justify their existence. Search in the outside world for a source of internal discomfort.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think it is indicative of the experience with the monkey, which was given food for pressing the lever. Lever, banana - good. Lever, banana - good. Lever, grape - wow! Lever, grape - very good. Lever, banana - did not understand, why not grapes? Lever again, banana - threw out. Lever, banana - shout at the experimenter behind the glass. In the second experiment in the same cage, the second monkey was tied, which could not reach the lever or the feeder. The first monkey at the end of the experiment began to beat the second. I found for myself the naughty monkey tied to throw out the accumulated irritation. When I'm angry, I try to remember this monkey.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another close term is aggression. Someone thinks that it is produced daily, so it must either be suppressed or merged in a civilized way in a safe direction. Or sublimate into creativity. Someone interprets aggression as a desire to overcome obstacles, such a natural and useful engine of development, the instinct of struggle. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not finding a separate sensation for aggression, I tend to its other definition - not an emotion, but letting myself destroy something when there is no other way to eliminate the unpleasant. The decision to break is not easy, a person tolerates to the last. Which, by the way, testifies to the goodness of human nature. Or about the influence of civilized education.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I note that a child who thoughtfully breaks a toy does not show aggression, he only learns the world by the method of decomposition. Not all destruction is aggression. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you look at what is happening in the mind and body, and not at the usual interpretation of words, then permission to break is what aggression is. Not an emotion or action, but only a resolution, a choice, a transition. Sensations and emotions are also present, but not something new, but already known rejection, fear, irritation. Plus a touch of pleasure. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The transition to a resolved situation is accompanied by pleasant feelings of relief after the cessation of the struggle. This note of pleasure gives the aggression properties of the drug - the subconscious learned the solution and begins to push it. At the level of consciousness looming pleasant anticipation of liberation from the unpleasant.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The term ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù is increasingly used as an antonym to ‚Äúindecisive‚Äù, therefore it acquires a positive coloring. The aggressor is not shy, famously overcomes obstacles to the goal - he is good. Such use of ‚Äúaggression‚Äù blurs the term, which still hides the permission to break. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The fact is, if you allow yourself to let off steam, then the next time permission will be given easier. And the accumulated steam will become more noticeable - come on, throw out the emotion, you can. There will always be enemies to steam off: wrong parking, wrong looking, thinking wrong, hindering progress or threatening the environment, too different or not sufficiently tolerant of others.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fear and annoyance, as well as intensifying their anxieties are used in politics and advertising. If you notice the moment when the image of something unpleasant is unwound in the media, we can safely assume that there will soon be calls to buy goods with no harmful or to break the rules, and even break the law, because (supposedly) only this can destroy this unpleasant.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the world you can always find something suitable for the fight. But the struggle with the present and actual enemy brings joy - the problem is localized, there is a clear way to improve the future, this is simply wonderful. If the struggle is infinite and is accompanied by unpleasant sensations, then we can assume the falsity of the external goal and look for a repressed desire in itself, under which the forces are allocated. Lack of dissatisfaction that warms up the boiler of a steam engine of irritation. And no matter where this car goes. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Irritation spills not only in the form of a fight. Its other manifestations are accusations and reproaches. For example, under the guise of education and care. As well as sarcasm, isolation and much more. I recommend reading about the signs of passive-aggressive behavior in order to learn to recognize irritation when it is disguised.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another form of irritation is boredom. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is often recorded in a separate emotion, but the sensations are all the same boiling of constrained forces. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bored can not sit back and relax, something encourages him to do anything. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The problem is just to understand what to do. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Simple constructive exercises are not suitable, they are swept aside, something is needed that gives a feeling of overcoming the barrier, liberation from the ban. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is boredom in a relaxed atmosphere, when anxieties are muffled - there is nothing to fear, you can afford more. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Due to the absence of fears, boredom is more dangerous than anger.</font></font><br><br><a name="24"></a><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Sadness (humility, crying, annoyance) </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anxiety squeezes, fear freezes, irritation boils, and sadness bakes - one more of the unpleasant experiences that can be found in yourself. If you look at the sensations, and not at the dictionary definitions and the difference of circumstances. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When hopes were not justified, the last way to get what you want disappeared, helplessness grows, or frustration occurs, the psyche has two ways to choose - to be angry or sad. To let off steam or to reconcile to inaccessibility. Persist in trying to break through the wall or melt down beliefs. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If unpleasant flashes of anger bother you, you want to learn how to cope with irritability, then you should learn how to grieve, walk the second way. Have you heard that men were allowed to cry? They say it is good for health.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And in pedagogy, crying is recognized as a necessary tool for growing up. If the child is crying bitterly, then you should not disturb him. It should not persuade, but to support the child, to show his understanding, to share his feelings. Then in the future he will not shy away from this normal experience, this useful emotion. Will become less irritable. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is curious that the resentment of feelings is similar to a complex fusion of several emotions at once - rejection, irritation and sadness. And if anxiety and rejection can provoke irritation, it is not clear why the irritation does not subside with the appearance of sadness. Offense is similar to the unfinished transition. Perhaps, therefore, it is felt more painfully, bringing both irritation and sadness to the highest levels.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People do not like unpleasant, it is natural. They strive to avoid unpleasant experiences, learn not to notice, compensate for pleasant events. They do not like to grieve, they aim at endless joy. Perhaps this is the reason why people are often irritable. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Emotions are helpful. Even unpleasant. Evolution created them not for beauty or splashing out. Emotions are nothing more than signals from the subconscious. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rejection prevents from harmful. Anxiety helps attention. Fear protects from hasty actions. Irritation helps to overcome old fears. Sadness helps to dissolve expectations.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Problems arise from the rejection of their feelings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We mix disgust and shame with fear, begin to overcome, breaking or deceiving ourselves. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We justify irritation by external enemies and exercise vypleskivaniem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We consider sorrow a defeat ... Do not be so.</font></font><br><br><a name="25"></a><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Fatigue (inhibition, drowsiness) </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I add fatigue to negative emotions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Its main difference from the above - it is associated with a pleasant activity of rest, therefore, it is rarely refused. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, it is more useful. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Feels like stupidity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The body asks to lie down, other desires are dulled, the world is filled with dull colors. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Like fear, it is designed to stop - stop doing it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because the muscles do not have time to relax. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or head tired of seeing the monotony of work.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Biochemically muscles to restore enough half an hour. If in half an hour the body has not rested, then we can talk about the failure of the program - the muscles do not relax and continue to work. Even if it looks like stillness. To restore the program of movement muscles need movement. And not fixing on the couch. And not a power load, the most important is diversity. Therefore, a change of activity is the best rest. A long sitting or lying down is an easy way to get tired. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Forces are allocated under desire.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If coffee and other stimulants do not help, then fatigue is not real. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Under the guise of fatigue may be hiding rejection. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lack of sleep, vitamin deficiency, winter depression - sometimes it is not a disease, but an attempt to explain the reluctance to perform duties. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Under the reluctance may be hiding dissatisfaction, anxiety or anything else. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, it is important to listen to your feelings, not the words that habitually come to mind. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At leisure, you can think about adding a separate emotion ‚Äúdrowsiness‚Äù to the list.</font></font><br><br><a name="30"></a><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Pleasant </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among the odd sensations, I counted five unpleasant ones: tense, freezing, seething, baking, stunning. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are three unpaired pleasant ones: anticipation, enthusiasm, achievement. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I wanted to add freedom, a basic level of good mood or an excess of strength, but they only mean the absence of a bad, no motive. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the lyrical, benevolently animated mood is not an emotion. Emotion leads to a change in the usual behavior in a particular direction, and does not serve as a backdrop for the whole row. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among the candidates for pleasant emotions, you can pay attention to the romantic mood and sexual attraction.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you google ‚Äúthree hormones of joy‚Äù, then you can find many articles in popular magazines, where dofamine, serotonin and endorphins are glorified. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes adrenaline, oxytocin and something else are added to the list. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you read the scientific literature, you can learn that not all of them are hormones. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some are generally groups of different substances. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Participate in complex processes are not independent. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not hormones and neurotransmitters generate joy, as not the doors of the bus generate a flow of passengers. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can memorize buzzwords to find out at a meeting, but you should not repeat everything that is written in popular magazines. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I propose to postpone the words and focus on the pleasant sensations.</font></font><br><br><a name="31"></a><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Anticipation (promise, advertising) </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The sweet anticipation arises at the thought of the pleasant. Which came into view or may appear. Alluring promises at the sight of a beautiful girl. Gambling expectation with the possibility of winning. Dear logo on the cover of the laptop. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A spoon of tar - non-compliance with borders. Anticipation at the sight of pleasant increases the attractiveness of neighboring images. If you go to the store on an empty stomach, it is easy to make extra purchases. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the advertising business, this property of anticipation is mercilessly exploited, putting the desired image next to the advertised product. They say that a girl with beautiful legs can advertise stockings and shoes, and a girl with beautiful breasts can advertise everything else.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A shopping trip can reassure, even if it does not end with shopping. The pleasure of owning a purchased product is rare, lasts only a short time and is only a new anticipation - use in an imaginary situation. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If other types of pleasures are not available, the anticipation acts like a drug - is addictive and requires an increase in dose. The multiplicity of expectations increases the chance of failure, growing anxieties take away the resources of the body. If you abuse dreams, then growing annoyance, inaccessibility upsets more strongly. Do not abuse surrogates. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can anticipate unpleasant, or rather, a pleasant moment of the end of anxious waiting. Anticipation resembles acceptance. A sweet prick of anticipation is different from the joy of a pleasant encounter in that anticipation is a product of imagination.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anticipation is the most accessible, but at the same time the weakest and most quickly passing kind of pleasant emotions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She offers to rush to the pleasant, prepares to meet with him. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But does not guarantee this meeting. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it can even prevent this meeting, if you get carried away with dreams, giving up reality. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Very old emotion, present in animals. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Animals have imagination and even dreams.</font></font><br><br><a name="32"></a><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Passion (action, travel) </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Joy, like any other emotion, is designed to influence behavior. Anticipation - it fits, get it. The joy of action - I get, do not get distracted. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes the joy of action is called a fad or state of flow. In which you can forget about other needs and move mountains on the way to the goal. Compared with anticipation, it is rare, stronger felt, more valued. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The flow can bring not only joy. If several unfinished actions accumulate, they start interfering with each other. If you want to solve a problem in a relationship, do a house cleaning, solve a work task and eat, then it is difficult to concentrate on anything. The state of the whirlpool is unpleasant, although the solution to any of the tasks in itself could be enjoyable.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The joy of action can be dangerous. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A person who is carried away by the flow can not only spoil the stomach and appearance, but also forget to look at the traffic lights. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if the purpose of the flow is a walk, then a person will notice a lot of details in the surrounding world and will get a lot of pleasure from it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hobbies become dangerous only when there are too few or too many. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Extremes are not always good. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I know two ways to the stream - strongly want or not have long-standing needs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first way is easier, the second is more reliable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Identifying needs and managing desires is a separate big topic.</font></font><br><br><a name="33"></a><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Achievement (relaxation, laughter) </font></font></h4><br>  The most short-lived, but the strongest joy, reaching to the euphoria, is designed to relax the body or mind, clutching with the efforts on the way to the goal.  Her motto - got enough. <br><br>  Fact - a person is afraid of tickling only where muscles have not relaxed for a long time.  The pressure on the clamped muscle generates pain, which can lead to increased tension, increasing pain, which will increase tension ... To protect against spasms, the body floods the problem area with pleasant sensations and switches the breath into a relaxing laugh mode.  Pleasure to relax. <br><br>  If you tickle on the stones, then you need to attend to relaxing feet.  If tickling lives on the sides, then you need to do the intercostal muscle tone, responsible for deep breathing. <br><br>  Stormy joy is a sign of the presence of the strongest tension.  If a person often laughs and jokes about trifles, then sometimes this indicates a tense life.  Laughter for no reason is a sign of the absence of other reasons for relieving tension. <br><br>  If a person likes to watch sports or go to rock concerts, then he may not have enough other reasons to relax.  The same goes for obsession with sex. <br><br>  If a person feels constantly tired, then he may not have enough skill of joy.  He does not know how to notice achievements, forgets to rejoice at what has been achieved, hurries to switch to the following goals. <br><br>  Some philosophers consider the purpose of life is to receive pleasure or to stay in eternal joy.  I like another point of view, according to which pleasant and unpleasant experiences are not a goal, but tools of life.  Provided by very different mechanisms, solving different problems, not ideal, but useful. <br><br>  Considering the pleasant sensations, I managed to distinguish six emotions: physiological and social motivation, estimated acceptance, sweet anticipation, speed of flow, finishing ribbon - and this is only in emotions, except for which there are feelings, states, reactions. <br><br>  The pleasure of a new impression and the pleasure of a story about a new impression, an explosion of sweetness, a delight of scratching, an exhausted massage, peace of idleness, sexual tides, the secret of love, satisfaction with revenge, the discharge of catharsis, the beauty of embarrassment ... <br><br>  The causes, mechanisms and manifestations of joy are numerous.  It is not right and even harmful to reduce them to any one feeling. <br><br><a name="40"></a><br><h3>  About lists </h3><br>  Notice, if by emotions we mean not ‚Äúa stimulating feeling‚Äù, but ‚Äúa way to non-verbally show our experiences to others‚Äù, then we get a completely different list of emotions.  Offhand: rejection, caution, show strength, request help, attract, offer, approval, encouragement, involvement ... <br><br>  And if emotions are interpreted as ‚Äúdistinguishable signs of other people's experiences,‚Äù then the third list will turn out.  Without thinking twice: weakness, sadness, anger, interest, joy, thoughtfulness ... <br><br>  If you explore the collective emotions involving experiences, you get a new list, partially overlapping with the previous ones. <br><br>  I do not consider promising attempts to teach a computer to distinguish or depict emotions, when classical lists of experiences based on the indefinite term ‚Äúemotions‚Äù are taken as a basis.  And there is no certainty that emotions are needed. <br><br>  For robots, OOC, KARO, EMA, CogAff, Affective Computing, Fomin-Leontiev, PAD, Plutchik models were invented - models are worth exploring, they can suggest curious ideas, but they are a mixture of experiences, ratings and signals. <br><br>  There are not just a lot of models, but a lot of them.  When <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/412845/">classifying emotions,</a> do you prefer a discrete, multidimensional, or hybrid approach?  Does your favorite emotion list relate to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">psychological theories</a> , to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">formal models,</a> or to something more ancient? <br><br>  The list of experiences from the ancient Chinese Taoists: anger, joy, doubt, sadness, fear.  With the layout of the elements and internal organs. <br><br>  Basic emotions from gestalt therapy: anger, joy, sexuality, suffering, fear.  Combined tenderness and sexual desire, now they are discussing the possibility of throwing out sexuality and adding resentment. <br><br>  Emotional experiences (race) in the Vedic literature of Hindus: pleasure, laughter, grief, pity, anger, heroism, fear, disgust, surprise.  Offered to add calm.  And they talked about the basic race - the desire for experience.  Total ten points.  As I understand it, the list was born when studying the experiences of the audience in theaters. <br><br>  A recent study of facial muscles again came to the list of four emotions: anger, fear, happiness and sadness.  They made the assumption that initially there were four emotions, that is why they are basic, and on their basis over the millennia more complex ones grew.  For example, fear can be interrupted by surprise, and anger can be replaced by disgust.  That's just no reason to consider mimicry the only indicator of experiences. <br><br>  Wikipedia on the topic of emotions mentions a dozen theories and concepts and dozens of models on top - more than emotions in some models.  I do not like a long set of clever words, the excess of options prevents the use. <br><br>  In the study of man there is a wide scope for observation and creativity.  You can choose your understanding of the term and choose a ready theory for it.  You can make your own classification based on your own observations of reactions, states, relationships. <br><br>  But first determine the purpose of the list to avoid drowning in an ocean of opportunity. <br><br>  For example, you can try to collect as many different things as possible to write another article in a regular journal.  Or you can try to eliminate contradictions, reconcile scientists and become famous in scientific circles.  Or explore ways to influence people to create spectacular films.  Or develop emulation for entertainment robots.  Or solve a subtask in the creation of artificial intelligence.  Or highlight the main reasons for concern and identify ways to solve problem experiences, pave the way for their personal or universal happiness.  Or just satisfy the passion for knowledge. <br><br>  Before studying someone else's list, I try to understand the purpose of its compilation.  When choosing different goals I get different lists. <br><br>  My list appeared as one of the side effects in the process of studying the contents of the head, so I narrowed the definition of emotion to a ‚Äúmotivating sensation‚Äù.  The result of my work clarified something, confused something.  I keep pondering my list. <br><br>  Refine your goal.  Determine what you are looking for.  Make a list.  Do not forget to have fun at the completion of the work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441134/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441134/</a></p>
