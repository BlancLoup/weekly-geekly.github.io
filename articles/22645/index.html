  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A little bit about professional deformation.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One programmer from those who love their work most of the day, wearing dirty jeans and sweaters, obsessed with what they do, once started asking strange questions ‚ÄúWhat is professional deformation?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhen the moment comes after which professionally deformed can't a person become normal? ‚Äù,‚Äú How to avoid professional deformation? ‚Äù.  Naturally, like any self-respecting crazy programmer, he approached these issues with all the scrupulousness that he was capable of.  He thought, analyzed, tried options, justifications, theories and algorithms for solving issues of interest to him.  But he could not find the answer ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The programmer, despite his young age, was already quite an experienced programmer, so as not to try to actively solve issues like having occupied his head for more than three days in a row.  Therefore, for many more months, the solution of the problem was sought in the background, occasionally receiving a higher priority, when confronted with new facts, such as the photographer who took off his jacket ( <a href="http://bash.org.ru/quote/395628"># 395628</a> ). <br>  He would have lived himself and lived.  I would drink beer, dabbled in scripts, amused myself with servachki and would not know grief.  Why, he just went to visit, as usual, to a friend of a girl.  Network fix, computer set up.  Help at home.  And the girl on the computer was not some kind of Vendian, but the Linux version was real.  You understand that it is a pleasure for our programmer to communicate with such a girl.  But he came late - the girl let him go and went to sleep, because she was very tired during the day.  A programmer drank tea, sat on the Internet - read Habr and also went to sleep with the girl. <br>  It is worthwhile to distract from the main narration and indicate that the programmer has been busy recently shoveling the office system for all sorts of things.  And since this system has evolved evolutionarily and consistently, then by the time the programmer intervened, a lot of rubbish and inconsistencies had formed there.  And the programmer was intelligent - he understood that he would have to tinker with this system in a variety of poses for a long time.  And he agreed to conduct refactoring with the authorities.  Agreed - started doing.  And the brains themselves on the third week already completely obfaktoril.  But the base has become beautiful.  Pleasant both in taste and color.  I really liked the programmer his work - the code was already 4 times smaller.  All ID-Schnick from a heterogeneous mass of different objects turned into a single slim numerical series.  Lepo in general, not a system. <br>  The programmer fell asleep that night quickly - he barely had time to hug the girl, when he immediately passed out.  But he could not sleep for a long time.  He woke up in the middle of the night due to the fact that the girl clung to him, hugging.  Not including consciousness, the programmer lowered his hand to the waist down where he felt the buttocks.  Two.  Like two simple and nice letters. ID Left - I. Right - D. This association captured the entire brain of the programmer, forcing him to wake up completely, savoring this sensation.  Two wonderful letters that he recently distributed to the entire system.  Two pleasant to the touch letters that resiliently yielded to his hands, often breathing through the standard interface and occasionally moaning, notifying about the health of the system and the work of all the methods and properties of its internal objects ... <br>  In the morning, the programmer had only one crystal clear thought in his head.  <b>Pancake.</b>  <b>That dodeformovilis.</b> <br><br><habracut>
