And it seemed to me that the expression ‚Äúpatience and a little effort‚Äù was best suited to Webalt.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>- So what is Vebalta?</strong>  <strong>Is it primarily a search engine or something else?</strong> <br><br>  - This is primarily a search, then the context and services. <br><br>  <strong>- What are the global goals pursued by Vebalta?</strong> <br><br>  - Earn money. <br><br>  <strong>- Honest answer :)</strong> <br><br>  <strong>- A Yandex employee asks when you will catch up with them, and I have another question: what are you going to surpass the current leaders, what innovations distinguish Webalt?</strong> <br><br>  - Objectively, the one who has the search quality will be better and more voluminous will win, and it will take time.  Inertness in the search is huge, but it can be easily broken - it is a matter of effort and proper work. <br><br>  It makes sense <a href="">for a</a> Yandex employee to <a href="">point to Ukraine</a> , where their company is slowly turning from a leader into an outsider.  If objectively searching competitors is better, then people will leak.  Slowly, but they will, and no advertising will help. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt want to talk about innovations, there will be food for the day :) <br><br>  <strong>- What do you think, what will be of Vebalt in ten years?</strong> <br><br>  - Ten years very much.  If we consider that ten years ago I was still in high school, and Rambler already ruled it, then it‚Äôs even scary to make plans.  <strong>We will make every effort to become number one.</strong>  <strong>It is quite real.</strong>  <strong>The eyes are afraid, and the hands are doing :)</strong> <br><br>  <strong>- To become number one in Russia, in Europe, in the world?</strong> <br><br>  - Of course you want in the world. <br><br>  <strong>- Affiliate sites based on Mamba, Loveplanet and the like have no place in issuing Webalts?</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>If the sale of goods or the provision of services is done exclusively through partner sites, and the goods or services are not offered through the ‚Äúparent‚Äù resource - is the ban on the partner sites still distributed?</strong> <br><br>  - It makes sense to consider the uniqueness of the content.  From the point of view of Webbalts, it is not at all interesting to suck in millions of pages of duplicates, just as it is not interesting to users.  This applies not only to dating, but also bookstores, mp3 and other similar markets. <br><br>  <strong>- It turns out, the parent resource also gets a ban?</strong>  <strong>Or just partnerships?</strong> <br><br>  - No, only partnerships <br><br>  <strong>- Are webalte welcomes reports of violators, ‚Äúwrong‚Äù sites?</strong> <br><br>  - Yes, it reduces the work on the "stripping" department. <br><br>  <strong>- How can I earn a ban on Vebalta?</strong> <br><br>  - The discrepancy of the content declared, redirects, Trojans, and so on. <br><br>  <strong>- Does Vebalta understand the difference between the doorway and the partner site?</strong>  <strong>Please open the topic.</strong> <br><br>  - Vebalta program, she does not know how to think :) In our understanding, a partner site without its own content, and a template made, but without a redirect, and leading almost all links to the "parent" site, is actually equal to the doorway. <br><br>  <strong>- How is the reputation of the companies on whose servers the sites are physically located taken into account when calculating the <a href="http://www.webalta.net/ru/about_webmaster_trust.html">level of trust</a> ?</strong> <br><br>  - To search for ‚Äúclots‚Äù of bad sites. <br><br>  <strong>- Does Vebalta plan to move towards personalized search?</strong> <br><br>  - Plans, but not before next year. <br><br>  <strong>- When will the long-awaited Webalta data center be launched and used?</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>What does this mean for ordinary users of the system?</strong> <br><br>  - He is already working.  For users, this means a good growth rate of the number of pages in the index.  In addition, we have already begun to cooperate with some hosting companies about sharing. <br><br>  <strong>- Does this mean the emergence of hosting services in the arsenal of Webalts?</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>If so, will the placement of sites with you be a priority?</strong> <br><br>  - Yes, we have received the necessary licenses and are now handing over the communication facility, after which we will provide services officially.  There will be no advantages for sites hosted with us.  Just high-quality new playground. <br><br>  <strong>- Tell us about the new engine Webbalts, what will change after its launch?</strong> <br><br>  - Changed almost everything!  In a nutshell, we now have UTF8, our own distributed file system with redundancy, a global search index (any search is performed by just 1 server), and so on.  About 70% of the code had to be rewritten. <br><br>  First of all, search algorithms, a search by pictures will be added and the appearance of new pages in the index will be almost realtime.  And the most important thing is that now we have learned how to build dimensionless indices and in the near future we will start looking around the world. <br><br>  <strong>- How often do search engine updates happen now and how often will they occur after switching to a new version of spider?</strong> <br><br>  - Right now it is not being updated, since in the next 7 days we are switching to a new platform.  In the new system, the full rebuilding of the index will be once in 7-10 days at first, then gradually we will increase.  Quick index - instantly. <br><br>  <strong>- What are the new services plans to launch Vebalta in the near and long term?</strong> <br><br>  - Now being tested: search by news, pictures, video, as well as mail, photo service and dating.  I'd like to do a search on blogs. <br><br>  <strong>- What are the expected innovations in existing Webbalt services?</strong> <br><br>  - Major innovations are expected in <a href="http://www.altastat.com/">AltaStat</a> and <a href="http://op.webalta.ru/">contextual advertising</a> .  Follow the news. <br><br>  <strong>- Recently, Vebalta <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/webalta/20535.html">bought dictionaries</a> .</strong>  <strong>When will the effect be noticeable?</strong> <br><br>  - As soon as the person who is responsible for snippets returns from vacation :) <br><br>  <strong>- Comment from the ethical point of view, the use of <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/i_am_clever/20041.html">search queries</a> in other search engines in the Webalts banners?</strong> <br><br>  - Good question.  Personally, I don‚Äôt really like it, but it‚Äôs effective and everyone uses it to some extent. <br><br>  <strong>- Is Vebalta going to acquire start-ups or small companies for the implementation of certain services?</strong> <br><br>  - Yes, we plan to buy a good mapping service later.  I can't say more yet. <br><br>  <strong>- There are <a href="http://www.webalta.net/ru/about_job.html">vacancies</a> on the Webbalt website.</strong>  <strong>What does it mean for professionals to work with you?</strong>  <strong>Are there any chances for the ‚Äúyoung and promising‚Äù?</strong>  <strong>:)</strong> <br><br>  - Of course have. <br><br>  <strong>- A question from the optimizer: how do you feel about SEO (I mean, not personally, but the attitude of the company itself)?</strong> <br><br>  - We treat normally. <br><br>  <strong>- Tell us about the team.</strong>  <strong>How many people work in the Moscow office and who are all these people?</strong>  <strong>:)</strong> <br><br>  - A very promising team, it took a lot of effort to assemble it.  I can say with a 100% guarantee that now we all work to the maximum.  The person is now closer to 50-60, mostly programmers, contextual advertising managers and people who are responsible for operations. <br><br>  <strong>- Webalta has two more offices.</strong>  <strong>Do they work, who work in them and what they do?</strong> <br><br>  - Yes there is.  There is a support service.  In the Kiev office there is also a contextual advertising sales department. <br><br>  <strong>- Do the stars work in vebalt?</strong>  <strong>It was rumored that you had someone from Borland in the state, is this true?</strong>  <strong>;)</strong> <br><br>  - All our stars are not public people, although they are regularly invited to give presentations at Western exhibitions.  A lot of people worked in Borland, if my memory serves me, then we have at least 4 people from there now. <br><br>  <strong>- Alexey, what do you do in your free time?</strong>  <strong>What are your hobbies?</strong> <br><br>  - I go to the gym, there are no other regular sessions.  If it is very difficult - I try to get out to rest in another city, country. <br><br>  <strong>- Please tell us about other projects to which you are related?</strong> <br><br>  - Over the past 7 years, I participated in the creation of more than 20 major projects.  Not to say that they were all successful, some of them simply lacked patience.  The largest is probably <a href="http://www.umaxsearch.com/">UmaxSearch</a> , a system for buying and selling Western traffic, including from search engines. <br>  Now we are preparing in parallel 2 more large projects to the west.  In August we start :) <br><br>  <strong>- What inspired you to create Webalt?</strong>  <strong>Who helped you with this?</strong> <br><br>  - All my life I live according to the principle of setting a goal above my capabilities and achieving it. <br>  My friends and people with whom we worked before Vebalta help. <br><br>  <strong>- What modern sites and services recently positively surprised you?</strong> <br><br>  - There was probably no such direct surprise :) <br><br>  <strong>- Please say a few words about Habrahabr :)</strong> <br><br>  - Hello Kryuchkov, I haven‚Äôt seen each other for a long time :) In general, I want to have fewer clans on the site, which together put up disadvantages to competitors or advantages to themselves. <br><br>  <font color="gray">Please do not kick very much - this is the second interview experience ...</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray">Criticism and comments are always ready to accept and take into account in the following materials.</font> <font color="gray"><br><br></font>  <font color="gray">Questions to Alexey can be asked in the comments - he will certainly try to answer them.</font>  <font color="gray">And I apologize to some habra people whose questions were asked at the last moment and this time were not included in the interview.</font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12592/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12592/</a></p>
