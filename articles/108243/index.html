  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Read more about closed auctions in the zone. RF</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On November 11 of this year, open registration of domain names in the Cyrillic zone of the Russian Federation was launched.  In any case, this is what the media called this process - open registration.  I also tried to use open registration and register for one of my clients the domain he asked for - I returned from vacation just that day.  And - you are absolutely right!  - nothing came of it.  It turned out that this domain is registered on RU-CENTER. <br>  I was surprised - my domain name to RU-CENTER does not fit, even if it is turned inside out.  However, by phone, I was quickly explained that what was needed ‚Äî open registration means that everyone can submit applications and, who managed before noon on November 10, he will participate in a closed auction.  Well, there may be lucky.  If there is enough money ... Well, and who did not have time, they openly declare to him that he is the very late man. <br>  Having marveled at the pretentiousness of the ideas of certain comrades about openness, I spat on this case, saying to myself that everything is done in a certain way in this country, but the story got a curious continuation ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Exactly at this moment on Twitter, a discussion about zona.rf took place (explain to me, for what the fuck does the parser remove the space before.rf is the smartest, or what?).  "I took part" in the discussion and I, speaking in that vein, that "they are all there scammers indiscriminately."  And in response, he received a most interesting document - Information sheet on the zone. RF <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer%3Fa%3Dv%26pid%3Dexplorer%26chrome%3Dtrue%26srcid%3D0B8pFv-otA2coMzJkMjdhZjMtNDBkOS00YjJhLTgzYmQtODM0MjQ4MWEyNTRh%26hl%3Dru%26authkey%3DCJP3iecO">[1]</a> . <br><br>  According to the document, in the first 6 hours of the registration of domains. Rf, 184352 domains were registered.  Of these, 56,785 (or almost 31%) are registered at RU-CENTER.  Further, captured domain names will be resold during closed auctions.  These actions are unambiguously classified as cybersquatting, which, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">according to Wikipedia for example</a> , is " <i>... the acquisition of domain names consonant with the names of well-known companies, or simply with" expensive "names for the purpose of their resale ...</i> ".  At the same time - I quote the published document - " <i>The acquired list contains: registered trademarks, names of organizations, brands, media names, common vocabulary words covering more than 90% of all used in common speech and in the classifier of goods and services of FIPS.</i> " <br>  At the same time, the Coordination Center of the National Domain, at the end of September, spoke out quite unequivocally - the auctions are just extortion of money (in fact) and CC does not recommend working with such registrars, preferring those who follow the established procedure for registering domains.  <a href="http://cctld.ru/ru/press_center/news/news_detail.php%3FID%3D901%26phrase_id%3D106560">The appeal of the Coordination Center regarding auctions</a> can be found on the Center's website; there is also a <a href="http://xn--j1ay.xn--p1ai/ru/domains/domenrf/rulesrf.php">domain registration procedure</a> .  What is characteristic, a close examination of the registration procedure (clause 3 of the Rules by reference) did not allow me to see there even a hint at auctions - they are not there and it is not indicated anywhere that someone has the right to organize them. <br>  By the way, the study of the Domain Registration Rules showed that the current practice of domain auctions selling released domain names (this practice is successfully used by RU-CENTER almost from the very beginning of its activities) is also outside the rules established by the Coordination Center.  The rules, meanwhile, are successfully violated ... <br><br>  After reading the published document, you can find a number of interesting points on which I will not dwell in more detail.  Instead, I will ask, as usual, a series of questions in the hope that they will give me a series of answers (Christmas soon, and during Christmas, various miracles happen). <br><ol><li>  There are rumors (unfortunately, Google Almighty did not help me) that Microsoft bought the domain name windows2000.com from some American private proprietor who makes and sells windows, paying very good money for it.  In this case, it is quite obvious and clear who, to whom, for what and on what basis paid the money.  However, in the case of zona.rf I would like to know who will receive the money raised from the auctions?  Who is the seller?  On the basis of what this seller had the right to put up domain names for auction?  On Habr√© - I am sure - there are RU-CENTER employees, and they, I hope, will help clarify the situation. </li><li>  Every day a huge number of domain names is registered in the network.  However, not every day - and not even every year!  - A new domain zone opens in the network.  Long before the creation of the zone. In RuNet, disputes and discussions raged, rumors and gossip, forecasts of all stripes and many opinions were raging.  In particular, one of the leading positions was taken by the opinion that as soon as the zone was opened, so cybersquatters would run in and that would be all the good undertakings would be cut off at the root.  And now, during the first six hours of life in the zone. RU-CENTER produced this very squatting on a monstrous scale - strictly in accordance with the predictions.  This large-scale capture of domain names could not be carried out without the knowledge and participation of ZAO TCI, which, in fact, serves the entire system.  So why did ZAO TCI not pay attention to such a significant event and did not take any measures?  Why at least did not report to the Coordination Center on the fact of cybersquatting? </li><li>  Domain auctions for zon.r.f domains are widely advertised in RU-CENTER.  They didn‚Äôt hear about these auctions, except that Buddhist monks (for this world doesn‚Äôt bother them) and tourists like me (because they‚Äôre far from home).  It would seem that the time is right for the Coordination Center to intervene even before the registration is opened, and to coordinate the issue - to issue a warning to RU-CENTER or to deny accreditation at all.  In the end, this is directly the activity for the sake of which the Coordination Center was created - accreditation and control of the activities of registrars.  However, the CC is only ‚Äúsincerely regrets this fact.‚Äù  I, in turn, sincerely wondered why together (and better instead), with regret, the CC did not exercise its immediate powers and did not fulfill its immediate functions?  I hope, on Habr√© there are also representatives of KC, who can explain to me exactly where I am mistaken. </li></ol><br>  From myself I will add that some light on the second item of the list of questions can shed a bit more close acquaintance with the JSC  SRIC, which we actually pay money by buying domains.  According to some information, the JSC  SRIC is half-owned by the General Director of the JSC  TCI Alexei Platonov, the former head of Aleksey Lesnikov, also for RosNIIROS.
