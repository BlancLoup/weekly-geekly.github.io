It is launched in a separate brand - Optishokz.  Points with bone conduction sound. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kr/u8/w1/kru8w1blzuax4c1i-ljpftdlxvq.jpeg"><br><br>  Of course, we already have these glasses.  And that's what we think about this: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The technical capabilities of ‚Äúconsumer‚Äù bone conduction are still limited to the head area.  Of course, you can attach the piezo dynamics to the elbow and listen to music through your finger, but this is rather an exceptional ‚Äúfan experiment‚Äù.

      In any case, products with such functionality are not very popular, but there were not so <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/406593/">few of them: a ring, a bracelet for watches,</a> etc.  Therefore, developers in this niche are forced to look for new ideas on top of the human body. <br><br>  So there are bicycle helmets, baseball caps and, of course, glasses.  And if Aftershokz was among the first to be directly in the headset category based on this technology, in any case, it is here that they have a competitive advantage and the widest publicity.  Then they go into the glasses much later than the others, and therefore, perhaps, this is done under a separate brand. <br><br>  <b>Glasses with music</b> <br><br>  To date, probably a dozen of them are known.  One of the first points with bone conduction introduced the company <b>Zungle</b> , setting a record for "Kik" under two million dollars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cb/zw/uj/cbzwujqb3ka1emm4aubqkjk8_uq.jpeg"><br><br>  Currently, literally in parallel with Optishokz / Aftershokz, another campaign on Indiegogo has been <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/musiclens-advanced-bone-conduction-audio-glasses">launched</a> - <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/musiclens-advanced-bone-conduction-audio-glasses">MusicLens</a> , and many others. <br><br>  I must say that in the overwhelming majority - this is still the category of ‚ÄúBone Conduction‚Äù, although there are examples of other developments - <a href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/wearables/frames.html">Bose glasses</a> , which use conventional speakers.  How it works in practice, we still do not know yet - it was not possible, but they assure that there is almost no sound around - this is at least. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2n/rd/ix/2nrdixcbbno1f9r54mb3yyyinwy.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, one should pay tribute to bone-conductive headphones - after all, the basic idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsafety in the city, along the road somewhere, etc., they conveyed, if not to the mass user, then to the mass developer and ‚Äúopen ears‚Äù as a concept .  But why go far, here, for example, <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/1314-0897provodnaya-garnitura-sony-sth40d-chernaya.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dbonecond%26utm_campaign%3Dsony">classic Sony headphones</a> , which do not block external sounds. <br><br>  <b>What are the problems with sunglasses</b> <br><br>  Any company that produces glasses, headphones, probably understands that cool cuts off a possible audience.  First, someone already wears glasses. <br><br>  In principle, there were no such problems with headphones.  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/407825/">The Trekz Air headset</a> , say, was (and still is) perfectly compatible with any glasses.  There are many examples of this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xg/_j/kx/xg_jkxgyyu1iwwtlzzz0fu0gqyi.jpeg"><br><br>  Sunglasses are not so simple either.  Someone likes a certain brand, someone has a certain design, etc. The taste here, unlike headphones, will be much more.  Plus, finally, not every weather has to such an acquisition (there should be a joke about athletes from St. Petersburg). <br><br>  <b>Optishokz</b> <br><br>  Of course, they have all these questions / problems.  Currently, the campaign is nearing the final, the total bill is <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/optishokz-revvez-bone-conduction-audio-sunglasses">about 410 thousand dollars</a> .  Headphones-glasses have already visited the channel Unbox Therapy, and now they got to Habr. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gk/z3/ra/gkz3ragxopixmdoz_vi97jpg4km.jpeg"><br><br>  They are delivered in a fairly strong large case, since they do not have the flexibility of the latest headphone models.  The bag, meanwhile, is included, but it does not possess protective properties. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/um/pp/ka/umppkaw_xott8mvkm7-wjev_uw0.jpeg"><br><br>  The glasses have a pronounced sports design, which, as is the case with headphones, clearly addresses them for runners, cyclists in the first place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pi/61/ps/pi61ps1ft8xorlvqvhmaux-d2m8.jpeg"><br><br>  As for the functionality and control, practically everything is as before: the control buttons on one of the arms, the battery in the same place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ss/nv/ab/ssnvabxmzabggsmpztzag40l0v4.jpeg"><br><br>  The main difference from headsets - the location of the speaker.  The speakers in Optishokz are located at the ends of the arches, that is, not at the zygomatic bone, as it was in the headphones (and as in MusicLens), but behind the ear. <br><br>  <b>Next will be a few dark photos with commentaries.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oz/9t/xc/oz9txc2si1nsgojh6e7fvbe5-7k.jpeg"><br><br>  In the "unfolded" form the arms look like.  The speaker does not touch the head.  To clearly hear the playback, you need to press the speaker to your ear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ja/hq/hf/jahqhfogptakr9ilwe36jw1fhgc.jpeg"><br><br>  For this, a simple flexion-extension mechanism is provided.  That is: put on - pressed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cx/9u/_k/cx9u_kgpkdsa89jqqskya8sxcuc.gif"><br><br>  In fact, there were fears that this would somehow additionally ‚Äúbulge out‚Äù the ear, and when worn, you will look somewhat comical.  Not confirmed.  Try to guess, for example, on which photo of the handle in the usual position, and on which - the speaker is pressed while we dismiss the photographer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/de/uz/8j/deuz8jkjbi_-w-l6nx3s7cnsc3o.jpeg"><br><br>  Piezodynamics are used in glasses, as well as in bone conduction headsets.  Here it is slightly smaller in size due to the design features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/js/t7/ez/jst7ezk_yxemgemb_vdk5k5ljia.jpeg"><br><br>  The outer part of it is something like a pad in shape, so that it is more convenient, because the glasses do not slip, do not crawl behind the ear - that is, the fixation is quite hard and it will rest on one point throughout the workout. <br><br>  Along the edges of the hole.  They, as well as in Aftershokz headsets, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/408061/">compensate for sound leakage</a> . <br><br>  <b>How does that sound</b> <br><br>  Well, it just opens a huge field for maneuvers.  Firstly, they sound unequivocally better than Persol and Ray-Ban, because they do not sound at all.  And such a verdict will be when compared with most sunglasses. <br><br>  But seriously, how to measure is not very obvious.  Comparing again with ordinary headphones is difficult, because it is not headphones in principle.  In its category, with headphones based on bone conduction - here they sound similar <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/426551/">to the Trekz Air model</a> .  Technically, the range is labeled 20 to 20000. <br><br>  Aftershokz Trekz Air, in terms of sound, produces a good middle ground, just as any headphones with bone conduction differ from us at too low and too high frequencies + they have a vibration response. <br><br>  In general, in its class - they sound good, especially considering that they are positioned as sound in the background during training.  However, for some reason it is to the form, it seems, this time there will be the most questions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ro/sk/1m/rosk1mpuirc1i7gif-qdekpdgo4.jpeg"><br><br>  For fans of the same ‚Äúclassics‚Äù, namely, bone-conductive <i>headphones</i> , we extended the coupon from the article above describing the features of the Trekz Air sound until the end of April.  <b>AIR20</b> - 20% discount on <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/aftershokz-trekz-air.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dbonecond%26utm_campaign%3Dair">this</a> model of headphones. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445542/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445542/</a></p>
