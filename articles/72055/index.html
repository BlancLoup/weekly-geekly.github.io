Increase the ability to work due to the transparency of the company </h4><br><br>  At one time, I was a hired employee, who did not even present what difficulties I would have to face by becoming a business owner and a boss over employees.  Of course, I thought that everything is simple, pay salaries and employees will be just happy to do it ... This is so only for the first months, then there is not enough motivation and you have to invent a lot of motivation options. <br><br>  ‚ÄúPay more!  And the employees will be happy ‚Äù- you will say ... Yes - this is true, but there is never a lot of money and you can raise salaries indefinitely without any visible result!

      "Punish!"  And employees will be afraid of sanctions ‚Äù- you will offer ... It‚Äôs also an option, but there‚Äôs no such boss who is happy to stand with a whip on an employee and scare him with sanctions for not doing work! <br><br>  What options remain? <br><br>  Let‚Äôs take as a basis: ‚ÄúEvery employee of any company is talented and wants to work, which is called the default!‚Äù <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  What can an employer offer?  For me, the best thing is to give employees the opportunity to participate in the affairs of the company directly, while receiving input data and understanding real goals.  What you can start with is simple: to reveal some information on the company's income: what we sell, why our product is better, why such a price, how every employee participates in the creation of a product.  Of course, you need to give information about expenses: what salaries do you have, what are these salaries, what can you do yourself to increase your earnings, what other expenses does the company have to pay for office rent, internet, coffee / tea / birthdays, etc. <br><br>  But this is not enough.  All this, without an understandable mechanism for participating in the affairs of the company, will not give anything but unnecessary and meaningless conversations. <br><br>  Need a participation mechanism!  For what you can do the following: give an opportunity to vote on making the maximum number of decisions for each employee, for convenience, make decisions on the company's intranet, where each employee can not only familiarize themselves with the company's affairs, but also offer his own decision / internal order, as well as vote for the suggestions of others! <br><br>  Thus, a certain system of self-regulation appears in the company, it becomes possible to understand and feel their personal participation in common affairs and in everyone‚Äôs income. <br><br>  And now the most interesting, dear Habraspolzovateli, do not you think this is utopia? <br><br>  What minuses do you see in an organization like this, for example, in your companies / firms / organizations? <br>  What are the minuses in a similar system seen by business owners? <br>  What are the obvious advantages?  Do they cover all the minuses you indicated? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72055/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72055/</a></p>
