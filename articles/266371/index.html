Pavel Muravyev from Naumen company with a report on the topic: <br><br>  JMS as a tool for scaling and building distributed systems <br><br>  In the modern world, technology and the rules of life are constantly changing.  How can complex software manage to adapt to such changes?  How to integrate a new component, a new technology, increase system performance without disrupting its operation?  The easiest way is to stop seeing the system as a monolithic block consisting of homogeneous elements, and instead create a layer that allows the components to communicate, despite their differences.  JMS is one of the tools for implementing this approach. <br><br>  Learn more about JMS and how to turn the network into a large computer - in the report. <br><br>  2. Dmitry Chuyko from the Oracle company with a report on the topic: <br><br>  CompletableFuture is here <br><br>  The standard library should help build any parallel computations, and in a way that makes good use of all the cores.  In Java, Thread, Future and ExecutorSevice have been around for quite a while.  However, the use of manual threads often causes typical errors and complexities.  It can be difficult to achieve maximum performance, and it is not always possible to fit into the general style of data processing.  Java 8 offers solutions.  For example, for the pull model it is more convenient to use streams (juStreams), and for continuations - Completable Future.  Let's see how easy it is to get rid of blocking calls and hell callbacks.  We will touch on the following topics: <br><br>  - transition from blocking execution based on Future to approach without blocking based on CompletableFuture; <br>  - API parsing; <br>  - overhead costs; <br>  - a simple guide for multi-level systems (for example, a web server); <br>  - what's inside and what's next. <br><br>  3. Egor Titov from Naumen company with a report on the topic: <br><br>  Documenting a RESTful API with Swagger based on Jersey <br><br>  Now the application scheme is quite popular when it is divided into two parts: client and server.  Both parts of the application can develop independent teams.  In this case, there is often not enough self-documenting code; documentation is needed that describes the ‚Äúpoint of contact‚Äù of the commands.  This can help Swagger - online documentation of your RESTful API and a simple option to create an SDK.  Jersey is an implementation of the server-side RESTful API.  I will tell and show you how to use these tools and try to demonstrate the generation of the SDK. <br><br>  4. Denis Kirpichenkov from Naumen with a report on the topic: <br><br>  Java application performance analysis <br><br>  They say that all satisfied users of java-applications are equally happy, and all those who are dissatisfied are each unhappy in their own way.  But, what to do with one probably common problem of users - ‚ÄúAfter installing a java-application, it became terribly slow down the server‚Äù? This report will be devoted to what to do with such user questions, using the example of a Web application in Java. report you will learn: <br><br>  - where it is better to start working with the performance (java) of the application; <br>  - what can be done to simplify the analysis; <br>  - what are the standard and non-standard tools and approaches for solving such problems. <br><br>  5. Lightning talks <br><br>  Lightning talks is a series of five-minute reports, you can apply for them at any time, at least 5 minutes before the start.  The presentation is optional but desirable.  The topic of the report is limited only to Java, you can talk about, for example, a newly discovered framework or a problem that you have recently solved. <br><br>  Lightning talks is a great way to try yourself as a speaker.  Therefore, we are waiting for your application for a report on lightning talks. <br><br>  6. Afterparty - kebabs and wine <br><br>  Participation is free, <a href="https://jug-sev.timepad.ru/event/238890/">do not forget to register!</a> <br><br>  We are waiting for you on September 26 at 12.00 in the hotel ATRIUM - King's Way (pr. Geroev Stalingrada, 47). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/266371/">https://habr.com/ru/post/266371/</a></p>
