  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do you make these 5 mistakes when connecting clients?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Attracting customers is not an easy task, but many companies lose conquered users immediately after the first launch of the system.  How not to become one of them? <br><br>  Consider some common mistakes in connecting clients that could ruin your business. <br><br><h4>  1. You bet on the interface when describing the value of the product </h4><br>  In the software business, a phenomenon called the moment ‚ÄúI take everything!‚Äù Is noted.  This is the moment when the value of the product becomes crystal clear for the customer, and he says, ‚ÄúOooh, okay, I take it now!‚Äù.  The ‚Äútake it all!‚Äù Moment often comes too late, as users are forced to tinker with the interface to understand the merits of the product. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Finding out the value of a product by exploring the interface is how to follow a recipe, when there is not the slightest idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe dish that you finally cook. <br></blockquote><br>  You do not start following the instructions to knead the dough and simmer the sauce in the hope that it will turn into a pizza - in order to complete what has been started, it is better to get acquainted with the context in advance.  In your case, the context is how much the user's life will improve with the appearance of your product in it. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      Having received ‚Äúyes!‚Äù Before signing the contract, you juggle the cards, doubling the benefits.  First, you are guiding the client to make meaningful follow-up actions in this direction.  Secondly, the awareness of the benefits of the product greatly increases motivation - much more than curiosity about it.  Light a customer before he leaves and does not register.  This will lead to the fact that many more people will understand your product and the first experience of interacting with it will be more productive. <br><br>  <b>Additional advice:</b> Contact a potential client and try to convince him to use the product, using only information from the site.  If this was not enough, think about what else needs to be said to seal the deal and add it to the materials. <br><br><h4>  2. Don't know what to do to increase conversion </h4><br>  On one inspiration from ‚ÄúI take everything!‚Äù You will not go far, until users actually experience first-hand amazement.  For the time being, ‚Äúaha‚Äù may reflect that people only understand the future benefits you provide.  Give them a ‚Äúwow moment‚Äù to experience these benefits.  So that you have confirmation that people really get the promised benefits of the product, track your success rates. <br><br>  By measuring activity, companies find that about 50% of users who have registered with the application log in once and never returned.  This is a sobering reality: you have invested so much in attracting new users, only to lose half of them immediately after the first visit.  How to slow down this bleeding? <br><br>  <a href="http://www.greylock.com/">Josh Elman</a> does this: he takes 20 registered users and tracks their every action, step by step, to see what caused them to switch from potential customers to existing ones.  Understanding the steps leading to the conversion will allow you to push users to the last goal.  Use the web viewer tool in <a href="https://metrika.yandex.ru/list/">Yandex.Metrica</a> for this <a href="https://metrika.yandex.ru/list/">.</a> <br><br><blockquote>  To get the user, do not focus on acquaintance with the interface, clicks here and there on the site will not give anything.  We need to help the client to complete meaningful tasks leading to mutual success. </blockquote><br><br>  You know that real collaboration does not begin when a new user is activated, but when he returns. <br><br>  <b>Additional advice.</b>  Measure the time it took users to successfully complete key steps.  Time is more precious than ever in the first minutes of acquaintance of a user with a product. <br><br><h4>  3. Kill the moment of the ‚Äúfirst visit‚Äù </h4><br>  During the launch of the system, let the client know that you are improving his life, and not just set a number of tasks. <br><br>  New users will not subscribe to the product, because they are under the super impression of beautiful buttons in the interface.  They will sign because they are interested in the values ‚Äã‚Äãyou provide.  Your goal is to give them a test of value by directing them to the first small victory in the simplest way. <br><br>  Let this victory be connected with the benefit of the product.  By giving users a taste of the sweet life with your product - even a little bit - you increase the likelihood that they will return. <br><br>  The next step is to get rid of what prevents users from achieving the goal.  Leave only the required steps and cut everything that can be done later.  Onboarding is not the time to throw a bunch of things on the wall and watch what will stick.  In the end, users may be trivially scared if you lay out in front of them a hundred functions of the application in the first stage.  Make it so that in the user's mind it is easy to set up and start working with the product a) just b) quickly. <br><br>  <b>Additional advice:</b> Motivate the client to move on: offer him an additional function for the 3 completed steps or extend the trial period. <br><br><h4>  4. Do not share success with the user. </h4><br>  Imagine how cool to finish all the cases from the list, crumple a boring piece of paper, throw it into the trash bin and in a pose of a super-hero look straight into the sky.  Let customers feel the same way when they get to the first significant point. <br><br>  Users challenge the fate and through thorns overcome the first frontier - it is strange that companies are not in a hurry to be close to celebrate success together.  The moment when the user has completed an important task is a good chance to establish a positive emotional contact with him. <br><br><blockquote>  Let the client know that you appreciate his work and come up with some kind of symbolic ‚Äúgive five‚Äù after the successful completion of the important stage. </blockquote><br><br>  Look for a moment when a client throws up his hand in a winning gesture, and prepare something special for him.  It is not necessary to make a grand gesture, even the timely ‚ÄúGood work!‚Äù Can work wonders. <br><br>  <b>Additional advice:</b> Write on my own.  Sample letters are annoying because they look like spam, even if written in the case.  Transmit once again to the client the idea that the benefit that the client will receive from the product is important to you, and not how much money he will pay you.  You are personally interested in his success, and your success is the result of joint work with the client. <br><br><h4>  5. Do not keep in touch after the completion of the system startup. </h4><br>  So, you explained to the users the benefits of the product, found out what steps to take and congratulated them on achieving their first success.  Perfectly!  What else?  The answer is simple: make them come back and do more! <br><br>  Grab the collar in the old-fashioned way: timely, standing letters in the mailbox. <br><br>  You started with the letter "Blah blah, welcome", and after 2 weeks sent "Your trial period is coming to an end."  Do you think this is enough for the user to get the most out of the application?  Believe me, you should not risk it.  Instead, make a to-do list of tasks to complete and write a series of letters for those who have not yet completed a certain part of the progress.  Meet the user, ask what his interests and goals.  Show how this or that product function will help him with a specific example. <br><br>  <b>Additional advice:</b> Advise, not command.  For example, if you have a dating app, do not tell users: ‚ÄúPlease upload several photos.‚Äù Ask: ‚ÄúDo you know that people with several photos are 60% more likely to receive a date request during the day?‚Äù.  Who will not want more dates? <br><br><h4>  The startup phase of the system will lead to success or destroy your business. </h4><br>  Creating a software business is difficult.  Time to keep the attention of busy people less and less, and competitors are pressing on all sides.  First impressions - the foundation of the strategy to attract customers. <br><br>  You want to share with the world a really cool product.  Do not let the efforts be wasted because of careless attitude to the first stage of connection.  Do everything in your power to improve onboarding and get users who return. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246577/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246577/</a></p>
