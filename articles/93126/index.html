  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Urban dead</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For those who are tired of the straights and rocket jumps, or who simply like the zombie theme of the zoo, I present the browser-based MMORPG Urban Dead! <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/68/2a/682ac099b32cd46bff62c94c0e9ac452.gif"></a> <br><br>  The game takes place in the town of Malton (Malton), in which the fault of the corporation NecroTech happened zombie apocalypse.  People who survived in the first days after the tragedy survive in the city.  They are opposed by zombies, breaking through the barricades, killing people, thereby increasing their number.  However, once died, there is a chance to return to life, but more on that later. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you already understood, all the characters in the game are divided into people and zombies.  When creating a human character, the player has the opportunity to choose one of the following classes: <br><ul><li>  Military.  Representatives of this class initially have skills in possession of weapons. </li><li>  Scientist.  Scientists can scan zombie DNA, track them on a city map, heal and resurrect people. </li><li>  Civil.  Representatives of this class are no different and are chosen most often for wagering. </li></ul><br>  Within each class, there are three subclasses that differ only in the initial skill of the character. <br>  Earning experience, the character can learn new skills, and for the study of the skill of another class will have to pay double the amount of experience points.  The exception is civilians, for whom the cost of all skills is fixed. <br>  Zombie division into classes do not have.

      In order to make a move, for example, move to a neighboring house, say something, use a first aid kit, etc., a character must spend 1 action point (AP).  The maximum number of AP is 50, 1 AP is restored within half an hour. <br><br>  Fleeing from zombies in homes, characters have a chance to find a variety of life-enhancing items ‚Äî weapons and cartridges to it, portable generators, which, when fueled, provide electricity, first-aid kits, receivers and transmitters, and even mobile phones that allow you to call another character knowing his number, wine, books, crucifixes, cans of paint, with which you can write on the walls of buildings, tools, etc. <br>  In homes where the generator works and there is light, the chance to find an object increases significantly.  On the other hand, the light in the windows attracts the attention of zombies, which should always be considered. <br><br>  For the revival of the dead characters in the city there are special places, the so-called.  revive points served by volunteer players.  Any cemetery is considered to be RP, but there are special places, the purpose of which can be recognized by the graffiti on the walls.  Read carefully, your life may depend on it;) <br><br>  Having the appropriate skill, the character can build and repair barricades in houses, blocking even zombies.  The level of security at home can range from simply closed doors, which can be opened by any medium-level zombie, to an extremely high level of barricades, which can be broken even by a small group of zombies.  God forbid you stay on the street with zero points of action - almost certainly the character will wake up dead.  And even in homes with the highest protection, it is better not to leave the character unattended for more than 2-3 days - during this time the house can be destroyed, or the PC will cut out its inhabitants. <br>  However, zombies in the game have an indisputable advantage over people - any killed person becomes a walking corpse, it is impossible to kill the ‚Äúpermanently‚Äù zombies - after spending some amount of AP he gets up. <br><br><h4>  Personal impressions </h4><br>  The game is focused on wagering.  You can, of course, be a loner, run around the city and wet all, but it quickly gets boring.  In addition, to the 20th level, the character gets all the skills of his own kind, and the player gets a question - either focus on his goals, or continue to raise the level at the expense of "alien" skills.  I met characters who were quite deeply involved in the role - a grandfather with a double-barreled guarding the church, and treating all those who wander to him in search of refuge;  doctors, directly on the battlefield, treating and resurrecting players;  bounty hunters, tracking down and eliminating criminals, and many others. <br>  Many players add to the profile a description of the character, his life story, manners, belonging to one group or another. <br>  I was pleased that in the game there are almost no barkers inviting to the next SuperBredoCilla-clan, spammers and other vermin that kill all interest in the game.  The overall impression is a game for relaxation, without haste, boring calculations of coins and the amount of exp to the next level.  If you are looking for an adventure game - Urban Dead may suit you;) <br><br>  Screenshot game: <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/6c/e9/6ce9845ac7e2208a34611389be82019b.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Pros: <ul><li>  Free </li><li>  Lack of trade, play money, paid things. </li><li>  Large map - 10,000 homes and facilities in Melton. </li><li>  There is the possibility of donate.  It is always nice to thank the author of a successful game. </li><li>  The game does not require constant online presence, and generally many hours of play.  For those who spend time in the game for hours, there is no advantage over those who come 15 times a day - you can spend 50 action points in two minutes, or you can stretch for the whole day. </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  Restriction on the number of moves from one IP per day.  However, for those who do not multi-lead, i.e.  plays only one character, easy enough. </li></ul><br>  Other features: <br><ul><li>  Many buildings have their own history, which can be found in the wiki game. </li><li>  There are various groups of players in the game, united by common interests - defenders of surviving, militant crowds of zombies, crazy fans of death and chaos, etc. </li><li>  It snows in Malton in the winter so there are traces on the snow. </li></ul><br>  Game site - <a href="http://www.urbandead.com/">www.urbandead.com</a> <br>  The official wiki is <a href="http://wiki.urbandead.com/index.php/Main_Page">http://wiki.urbandead.com/index.php/Main_Page</a> <br>  You can read in Russian <a href="http://fforum.kochegarov.com/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D16495%26st%3D0">here.</a> <br>  If you want to try and there will be questions - write in a personal, I will try to answer.  Successful survival. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93126/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93126/</a></p>
