  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The viral video industry brings millions of dollars</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once amateur video was created ‚Äúon the knee‚Äù and spread over the Internet at the speed of light.  Now the viral video goes to the professional level.  According to experts, the viral video industry is now earning $ <nobr>100-150</nobr> million per year.  On the website of the magazine Business Week published an interesting gallery with samples of the <a href="http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/07/viral_marketing/index_01.htm">most popular videos</a> in the history of the Internet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main feature of a viral video is humor.  The video should be very funny.  If people like it, then success is guaranteed.  In this case, you can only observe the spontaneous dissemination of information on the Web and register a stunning surge in attendance of the website, whose address is recorded at the end of the video.  The invasion of people will be such that it can be compared to a natural disaster.  Viral advertising is as uncontrollable as a tornado, hurricane, or tsunami. <br><br>  However, many companies do not lose hope that they can learn if not to manage this process, then at least to begin with it.  Indeed, after all, quite small movements in the atmosphere are enough to initiate a tornado ‚Äî and a chain reaction immediately begins.  To date, the US viral video market has grown to $ <nobr>100-150</nobr> million. It employs companies.  who specialize in creating just this kind of advertising.  For example, the agency <a href="http://www.cpbgroup.com/">Crispin Porter + Bogusky</a> , which created the famous video <a href="http://www.subservientchicken.com/">Subservient Chicken</a> .  With more than 400 million views, it has become one of the most viral videos in the history of the Internet. <br><br>  Most of the revenue goes to advertising agencies, but websites are also starting to make money.  For example, the business model of the latest discovery on the Internet <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> was originally built on the phenomenon of viral video and user-generated content.

      But now, when the Internet is saturated with video materials, it is becoming increasingly difficult to build a spectacular viral campaign.  We have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to attract the attention of the audience.  For example, the London agency <a href="http://www.theviralfactory.com/">The Viral Factory</a> charges from $ 250 thousand to $ 500 thousand for the creation of a video and promotion on the Internet.  Today advertisers even have to pay for posting on sites.  For example, YouTube sells some good places on its website, although the value is not disclosed.  New players are coming to this market.  Even Google has recently begun testing video ads.  Microsoft is planning to release a competitor YouTube before the end of this year.  About the new site almost nothing is known, except for its code name Warhol. <br><br>  Virus advertising agencies shoot very expensive, high-quality and funny commercials, and then pay for their placement on popular entertainment sites on the Internet.  Thus, it is possible to guarantee almost 100% viral effect.  For example, Unilever, one of The Viral Factory‚Äôs last clients, paid about $ 200,000 for creating a series of funny videos about Ax deodorant. These videos tell about a resident of a small town in Alaska who is trying to attract the opposite sex with the smell of her deodorant.  They were posted on the popular British website <a href="http://www.kontraband.com/">Kontraband.com</a> , which takes from 10 thousand to 50 thousand pounds a week for accommodation.  In a few weeks, the number of video views exceeded 10 million. <br><br>  Previously, the viral effect arose unexpectedly, and the creators of some videos did not even plan it.  Now everything is different.  Professional agencies can guarantee the viral distribution of video on the Internet, but it will cost a lot of money. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4247/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4247/</a></p>
