  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Car, Internet of Things and other technologies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Perhaps the modern automotive industry is one of the most innovative industries.  Recently, the car has successfully evolved from a mechanical monster, absorbing oil resources, into a computer that effectively controls the electric drive.  Also known are quite successful commercial samples of a hydrogen car, for example, from the same Toyota.  But many will agree that with all this, the romance of the gasoline engine is unlikely to ever die.  Is it worth striving for something new, is progress visible in the industry now?  It can be noted that even an unlimited power reserve of electric vehicles and, in most countries, an unformed infrastructure of gas stations, for example, with hydrogen fuel, is unlikely to slow down the progress of the development of a ‚Äúsmart car‚Äù.  Basically, the blame for that is tight security measures, which is really very important for all of us. <br><br>  On the other hand, computer networks and the Internet closely embraced the whole world, but at the same time, the car and the Internet of Things (IoT) are far enough apart from each other.  In the previous article " <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/unet/blog/296541/">OBD-II Diagnostic Connector, as an Interface for IoT</a> ", it was suggested that for virtually any car adapter is based on OBD-II diagnostic interface, GPS receiver, 3-axis acceleration sensor, combined with a gyroscope and, of course , with access to the Internet, actually solves the problem of a ‚Äúconnected car‚Äù (Connected Car).  Next is not how much technology, but the mechanisms of interaction between the vehicle and IoT devices.  In this publication, I would like to consider how many mechanisms for building an IoT platform for road users or go deeper into road safety issues, which is undoubtedly important, but just consider what the automotive industry already has in the world for other industries or its developments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/en/ev/t1/enevt1qqmmomzi_87mscsumvsv0.png"><br>  <font color="gray"><i>Intel IoT Platform - IoT @ Intel</i></font> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Undoubtedly, with an increase in the number of Connected Car, big data will become available on our roads, containing a variety of characteristics and potential statistical information that can already be used by service stations or automakers, for example, to improve the quality of cars and their units, as well as the introduction of intelligent approaches to the prediction and planning of vehicle maintenance.  Insurance companies will be able to get information about the type of driving and statistics on the failures of certain units of specific brands of cars, which certainly can, and should, be taken into account when pricing insurance, etc.  It is also indirectly possible to take into account the quality of road coverage, for example, by analogy with projects that use the readings of inertial sensors mounted in modern smartphones, linked to GPS data.

      But, what will the Connected Car give to its owner?  Is it possible that a ‚Äúconnected‚Äù car is only an Internet access point, some multimedia features and some data, which, however, may not be useful.  How relevant is the scenario when the car drives up to the house and the ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù system initiates the raising of the garage door, turning on the exterior lighting of the driveway, the light in the hallway and the room, exposes a comfortable floor heating temperature?  But this is comfort.  These are such inconspicuous things that in the future will simply complement everyday life.  But, as it is not difficult to notice, the progress of IoT is not only Connected Car, ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù and other technologies, but all of the above together.  Only synergy of teamwork and interaction of IoT components will make a breakthrough in the development of the concept of the Internet of things a reality.  In the meantime, we are considering individual components, which themselves do not have significant significance for the perception of the IoT picture as a whole. <br><br>  Perhaps, the Connected Car through the eyes of automakers is definitely not only OBD-II data and several auxiliary sensors.  Let's imagine that such systems as Adaptive Cruise Control, Emergency Braking, Pedestrian Detection, Collision Avoidance, Collision Avoidance are already relevant for modern cars. Traffic Sign Recognition, Lane Departure Warning, Cross Traffic Alert, Blind Spot Detection, Rear Collision Warning, parking (Park Assistance) and many others.  And let us think: what if this data, directly or indirectly, becomes available to other road users? <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-seK21Gh4bQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The interaction with each other at the level of data exchange of vehicles V2V (Vehicle-to-vehicle), vehicles and transport infrastructure V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) or, quite generally, vehicles with the medium of movement V2X (Vehicle-to-everything) - This is the next step in the development of transport or, simply, intelligent transport technology (Intelligent Transport System).  At the moment, there is an interesting approach here, which is actually based on the deployment of a Wi-Fi network according to the IEEE 802.11p standard, which allows to solve the problem of the possible lack of access to the Internet, i.e.  V2X systems use this protocol to communicate with each other without requiring an Internet connection.  The exchange of required information between the participants of V2X communications is carried out by the so-called standard BSM messages (Basic Safety Message).  Unlike the MQTT protocol, which is de facto essential in IoT solutions, for V2X networks, the quick transfer of a standardized data block during communication between network participants is more relevant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8a/xq/cl/8axqcley2wx-knlttnqwv7o-xfo.jpeg"><br>  <font color="gray"><i>V2X communications: A pointless wait for 5G?</i></font> <br><br>  The advantages of the V2X are quite understandable, for example, it will be possible to obtain data about a vehicle that is out of sight, on the basis of which various vehicle safety devices can function or it becomes possible not to recognize road signs by intelligent systems of the car, but to simply communicate with the corresponding warning systems and etc.  Implementing the IEEE 802.11p standard on board a vehicle, or an Embedded System (Embedded System) for the motion infrastructure, is a simple task, for example, if you use the RoadLINK SAF5400 chip offered by NXP.  This is a high-performance DSRC ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedicated_short-range_communications">Dedicated short-range communications</a> ) car modem for the V2X.  The SAF5400 modem can relay up to 2000 basic security messages (BSM) per second, and also integrates high-performance V2X wireless security technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n0/en/0k/n0en0k0j_-is77i8aluaybhjdb0.jpeg"><br>  <font color="gray"><i>RoadLINK SAF5400 Single Chip Modem for V2X - NXP Semiconductors</i></font> <br><br>  Wireless technology for V2X perfectly complements the already existing infrastructure, for example, 3G or LTE networks, but still, sometime we will wait for the introduction of 5G generation networks.  It is obvious that it is not by chance that leading automakers and companies engaged in the field of electronics and telecommunications created the <a href="http://5gaa.org/about-5gaa/about-us/">5G Automotive Association</a> (5GAA).  The 5GAA association is aimed at solving Cellular-V2X (C-V2X) tasks, i.e.  interactions of V2X and cellular technologies to improve the quality of transport services and improve safety on the roads.  For example, on the eve of 5G, Qualcomm and LG announced joint development for Cellular-V2X.  LG is developing automotive solutions based on the Qualcomm Technologies platform, which supports Gigabit LTE speed using the Qualcomm Snapdragon X16 LTE modem and is complemented by the QCA65x4 Wi-Fi 802.11ac solution.  The proposed platform for Connected Car also supports 802.11p / DSRC standards. <br><br>  Also of interest are not only innovations in the field of automotive electronics, but also the very principle on which new solutions for vehicles are being built.  For example, once upon a time the electronic heart of a car was an ECU (Electronic Control Unit) engine control unit, which controlled various actuators, and to which information from various sensors flowed.  But soon the CAN bus (Controller Area Network) and the concept of an intelligent sensor and intelligent actuators appeared.  Those.  The sensor began to be not only a sensitive element and a matching device, but also a microcontroller became part of an electronic sensor, which gave the system ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù, since it could be programmed to work both independently and as part of a network of controllers.  The same can be said about actuators.  In fact, with the advent of a multitude of electronic devices on the vehicle, the vehicle itself became the platform for a specialized and very reliable distributed microcontroller network. <br><br>  For solutions of the Internet of things, it may seem very attractive to issue all the data of the car‚Äôs internal CAN network to the cloud, but now it seems absurd.  It is unlikely that so much data is interesting for analysis, however, if we do not consider the run of the sports car on the track or any test tests.  Moreover, while the throughput channels of cellular communication leave much to be desired, such an approach for the consumer market is unlikely to lead to a final solution, by the way, one should not forget that access to the internal network is contrary to elementary cybersecurity rules.  However, the processed data at the level of the electronic engine control unit, which are available on the OBD-II interface, as already noted, is quite consistent with the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãIoT.  It should also look at the new approach to the design of automotive electronics - this is the domain architecture proposed by NXP. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iq/5s/ir/iq5sirelcfwftfylorbrsgpnkxs.jpeg"><br>  <font color="gray"><i>Domain-based architecture removes many challenges of distributed architecture.</i></font> <br><br>  In general, the domain architecture is not something completely new, but for a car it becomes a new stage of development, where the electronic ecosystem will no longer represent a network of intelligent sensors and actuators, but a network of intelligent modules and systems.  And here for the IoT or Connected Car approach, the entry points are visible, i.e.  for a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe movement of a vehicle, aggregated data on various electronic modules of a car will be quite interesting. <br><br>  And since we are talking about the domains of trust or, more correctly, the level of segmentation of automotive embedded electronic systems, we should immediately recall the concept of information security of these modules and systems, both in general and at each level of separation of ‚Äúpowers‚Äù.  And here we can not but be interested in the concept of security proposed by the same NXP.  The engineers of this company are also proposing a multi-tier architecture, but already car security.  The first level is secure interfaces.  Undoubtedly, the external communication channels of the car must be protected to ensure the privacy of users and the safety of the vehicle itself.  To this end, traditional encryption and authentication approaches are proposed.  At the second level, in a protected car, it is proposed to use a gateway (Secure Gateway), which should provide secure access to the Internet through the firewall, and also it should serve as a converter of various interfaces.  The gateway should allow the separation of domains of critical systems and, for example, entertainment systems.  The third level is protection against intrusion into the car‚Äôs internal networks.  Fourth - protection of built-in control units, for example, engine control unit from intrusion, substitution of program code, etc.  At the last, fifth level, traditional methods of protecting the car from invasion are proposed, for example, electronic locks, immobilizer, etc. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cclydY87a1E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  An interesting moment to ensure the safety of electronic components of the car at the operating system level.  For example, the company Green Hills Software offers the automotive industry its real-time operating system INTEGRITY RTOS.  This operating system for embedded systems (Embedded Systems) is aimed at ensuring reliability, security and maximum performance of data processing in real time.  It uses hardware memory protection to isolate and protect embedded applications.  Protected partitions guarantee the correct operation and protection of the operating system itself and user tasks against erroneous and malicious code.  To ensure the convenience of developers, so-called intermediate software is proposed, for example, the implementation of file systems and popular network protocols, etc.  Modern architecture INTEGRITY is well suited for multi-core processors, focused on embedded systems.  The operating system supports processors: Altera Cyclone, AMD x86, Applied Micro (APM) Power Architecture, ARM Ltd., Fujitsu ARM, IBM Power Architecture, Intel Architecture, Marvell ARM and PXA, MIPS Technologies, NXP Qorivva, NXP QorIQ, NXP ColdFire, NXP I.MX (ARM), NXP Vybrid (ARM), Renesas R-Car, Texas Instruments OMAP, Texas Instruments DaVinci, Texas Instruments Jacinto, Texas Instruments Sitara, Xilinx Zynq.  The list, as they say, is impressive. <br><br>  But the most interesting is the proposed approach of INTEGRITY Multivisor, i.e.  A robust and portable virtualization infrastructure is offered.  The system supports high-performance "full virtualization", where no changes are required in the guest operating system.  If access to devices should be shared between guests and / or applications, it is easy to add applications that coordinate access to equipment.  On processors that do not have hardware support for hypervisor mode, INTEGRITY Multivisor applies a thoroughly processed, minimal modification of the guest operating system to maximize performance without sacrificing ease of migration and portability.  Thus, INTEGRITY Multivisor integrates general-purpose guest operating systems with an integrated ecosystem of real-time applications and middleware. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xi/bz/ub/xibzubhipdz1wldo5ormhawvcpm.jpeg"><br>  <font color="gray"><i>INTEGRITY Real-time Operating System - Green Hills Software</i></font> <br><br>  We get a classic example of using virtualization, but for embedded systems.  Undoubtedly, this approach allows you to implement interesting tasks, for example, building an entertainment center based on a universal operating system (Linux or Windows), and at the same time, developers will have the opportunity to create real-time solutions for displaying dashboards.  On the other hand, the hypervisor will protect critical to system security from the potential malicious code of standard solutions of the universal operating system level.  Obviously, virtualization in the classical sense, which has already become the standard for traditional computer solutions, is rapidly moving into the world of highly reliable systems. <br><br>  Speaking about the domain architecture of hardware solutions for automotive electronics and the modular architecture of the corresponding software systems, it is necessary to single out, perhaps, the most rapidly developing direction in this area - the construction of autonomous vehicles.  To solve this problem, various software and hardware solutions are proposed.  For example, Tesla Motors aims to use an embedded solution based on <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/10/20/tesla-motors-self-driving/">NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 AI</a> .  A distinctive feature of such a platform is the implementation of a hardware architecture designed to apply <a href="https://proglib.io/p/intro-to-deep-learning/">depth learning</a> algorithms to the implementation of an artificial neural network, which, in turn, will become the basis for the autopilot operation.  In general, even enthusiasts can <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/282010/">offer</a> their solutions for unmanned vehicles.  However, not all so simple.  It is unlikely that someone agrees to ride on the highway, on which the "amateur hacker" will teach your autopilot.  The good news is that the authorities of most countries at the legislative level control the modifications of serial cars, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m3/cv/wr/m3cvwrbmoruporunzk9vzmdg36k.png"><br>  <font color="gray"><i>Autonomous Car Development Platform from NVIDIA DRIVE PX2</i></font> <br><br>  But then it turns out that the "progress of technology" is only in the hands of corporations?  In general, this is not so, it is quite possible to get acquainted with various online courses on building autonomous vehicles, for example, <a href="https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/">MIT 6.S094: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars</a> .  For carrying out experiments and development - it is necessary to use specialized polygons.  Here you can only envy and admire the <a href="https://mcity.umich.edu/our-work/mcity-test-facility/">township of Mcity</a> University of Michigan.  This polygon city is fully designed for testing connected cars and autonomous vehicles. <br><br>  As it is not difficult to notice, the automotive industry and transport technologies, at the present time, absorb all the latest in the field of telecommunications, computer equipment, programming electronics and solving machine learning problems.  As a result, in a short time we will be able to get more reliable, safe for critical systems approaches and technologies, but already as derivatives from the solutions of the auto industry. <br><br>  Undoubtedly, now the automotive industry is experiencing a huge leap in development, which is caused by a rapid leap in the improvement of information and communication systems in transport.  The breakthrough in the automotive industry was made possible by improving the reliability and security of electronic on-board systems and the formation of new approaches to the design of information networks based on them. <br><br>  Of course, the future is ahead, but it‚Äôs very clear that the car from the future will be built on the basis of a network of on-board intelligent modules that will be grouped into specific domains to solve the key tasks of ensuring the reliable operation of vehicle units to ensure the comfort and safety of the trip.  The cars themselves will become part of the V2X network and at the same time a part of the Internet of things.  Due to such technologies, it becomes possible to interact, for example, a car and a drone, which will pave the route or, alternatively, a specialized drone or their network can become a V2X access point in the air.  Many other scenarios can be offered, but always, the main thing in the automotive industry should be to ensure safety, reliability and ride comfort. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zCKiwql_nOE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Traditionally - this publication is a small digest of technology.  We hope that the links collected during the preparation process will interest the readers of the blog and may become the starting point in the study or improvement of technologies from the considered scope of application.  Note that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpublishing was inspired by the video of the plenary reports of the NXP FTF Connects conference held in Detroit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dcs0qmthyUV8">.</a>  and presentation materials of <a href="https://www.nxp.com/support/training-events/nxp-ftf-connects:NXP-FTF-CONNECTS">NXP FTF Connects</a> conferences available on the company's website. <br><br>  Automotive themes and the related concept of social IoT, will certainly be continued with new publications in our blog.  For example, IVI entertainment systems (in-vehicle infotainment) were not mentioned at all in the current publication, but this is a whole direction that geeks and car owners are always interested in.  Yes, and much more, as they say, requires a more detailed study of the topic, for example, the interaction of autonomous vehicles and the emergence of a new trend - the car as a service or service, etc.  Your comments on this topic are welcome. <br><br>  In turn, I would like to congratulate the readers of our blog with the coming New Year and a series of winter holidays!  Wish this year interesting and exciting projects that will certainly change the world for the better, new gadgets and only positive impressions! <br><br><h3>  Interesting resources and links: </h3><br>  - <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/296575/">Toyota is going to create electric cars along with "hydrogen" cars - Geek magazine</a> <br>  - <a href="https://blogs.intel.com/iot/2015/11/23/building-the-next-generation-car-with-intel-iot/">Building the Next-Generation Car with Intel IoT - IoT @ Intel</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/automotive/automotive-security-best-practices-white-paper.html">Car of the Future ‚Äî Automotive ‚Äî IoT @ Intel</a> <br>  - <a href="https://dou.ua/lenta/articles/dou-projector-uaroads/">DOU Projector: ‚ÄúRoads of Ukraine‚Äù - road monitoring service</a> <br>  - <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/dwblog/2016/connected-cars-iot-internet-of-things/">Connected cars - The ultimate Internet of Things thing - IBM developerWorks Blog</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.nxp.com/video/:SAFETY-SMART-CONNECTED-VEHICLES">70 Seconds of Safety with Smart Connected Vehicles - NXP Semiconductors</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.eenewsautomotive.com/design-center/why-80211p-beats-lte-and-5g-v2x">Why 802.11p beats LTE and 5G for V2x - eeNews Europe</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2017/02/23/qualcomm-and-lg-bring-5g-and-cellular-v2x-communications-vehicles">Qualcomm and LG Bring 5G and Cellular-V2X Communications Into Vehicles - Press Announcements</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.chiptuner.ru/content/ecu_dd/">ECM used on VAZ cars - Chip tuning and injection diagnostics</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.nxp.com/applications/solutions/automotive/functional-safety-and-security/secure-vehicle-architecture:AUTOMOTIVE-SECURITY">Multi-layer Automotive Security Architecture - NXP Semiconductors</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DDT7wwOv0kuw">Green Hills Software at CES 2017 - Robert Redfield</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2016/03/a-brief-history-of-autonomous-vehicle-technology/">A Brief History of Autonomous Vehicle Technology - WIRED</a> <br>  - <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/08/22/parker-for-self-driving-cars/">Get Under The Hood Of Parker, Our Newest SOC For Autonomous Vehicles - NVIDIA</a> <br>  - <a href="https://ain.ua/2017/03/17/16-voprosov-o-bespilotnyx-avto-i-mire-s-nimi-prezentaciya-partnera-andreessen-horowitz">16 questions about unmanned cars and the world with them: the presentation of the partner Andreessen Horowitz - AIN.UA</a> <br>  - <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/277788/">36 projects of unmanned vehicles - Geek magazine</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/tehnologii/341821-mashina-kak-usluga-kak-razvitie-bespilotnyh-avtomobiley-menyaet-industriyu">Machine as a service.</a>  <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/tehnologii/341821-mashina-kak-usluga-kak-razvitie-bespilotnyh-avtomobiley-menyaet-industriyu">How the development of unmanned vehicles is changing the industry - Forbes</a> <br>  - <a href="https://hightech.fm/2017/12/19/autonomous-car">Autopilot Martti can go on a snowy road without marking - Hi-Tech</a> <br>  - <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/259224/">Welcome to the city of robots-cars - Geek magazine</a> <br>  - <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/wayray/blog/295825/">Independent city: 3 technologies of "reasonable" traffic management - Geektimes</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371207/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371207/</a></p>
