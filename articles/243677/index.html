Thus, in Google Play, the number of applications in August of this year reached 1.3 million, and the App Store reached this figure in September. <br><br>  Microsoft is under serious pressure and is trying in every way to expand the market of its platforms, so the release of a branded phone is not far off.  For this, Microsoft donated even the Nokia trademark, as it changed the loyalty program for its products as a whole - for example, Microsoft started to release its products for Android Gear, and the latest update for Office Mobile on iOS made it more functional than on Windows Phone itself.

      If we talk about the total share of mobile devices on Windows, then according to Kantar Worldpanel, Microsoft is experiencing hard times: having reached a peak of 10% in 2013, the share of Windows dropped to 8.1% in 2014.  The only exceptions are some countries - for example, in Italy, the share of Windows has surpassed even iOS and reached 15% in September. <br><br><br><h4>  SuperData distributes its report for free to Eastern Europe Digital Games Market </h4><br>  SuperData provides an opportunity to free ‚Äú <a href="http://superdata-research.myshopify.com/products/eastern-europe-digital-games-market">buy</a> ‚Äù a report on the Eastern European digital games market.  It discloses in detail information about the growth of profits from games in Eastern Europe, which reaches 7% compared with the data for last year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f62/f6d/b9f/f62f6db9fb3742e1a638925ac1d50bd1.png"><br><br>  Russia occupies a leading position in this market and brings about half of all revenues, which is more than $ 1 billion. Following are countries such as Poland and Turkey, which bring 20% ‚Äã‚Äãand 14%, respectively. <br><br>  In the report, it will be possible to find answers to such questions as: what makes the Turkish user more attractive and whether it is worth ‚Äúlooking‚Äù at other Eastern European countries, how users prefer to make payments, etc. <br><br>  It also analyzed the growth of social networks and android devices, a drop in interest in MMO games and a weak interest in consoles. <br>  All this and much more is disclosed in this report and is freely available - do not miss this opportunity! <br><br><br><h4>  Oculus SDK for mobile platforms </h4><br>  Oculus Mobile SDK is now <a href="http://app2top.ru/game_development/%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB-oculus-mobile-sdk-47815.html">available</a> at the Oculus Developer Center.  This SDK will allow you to develop mobile applications for the Samsung Gear VR Innovator Edition virtual reality helmet that is compatible with the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed4/70c/ab8/ed470cab8adf4c9c98e0174802184ad7.jpg"><br><br>  Pre-order can be done today.  The cost will vary from $ 199 to $ 249.  Deliveries of a helmet from Samsung will begin at the end of this year. <br><br><br><h4>  Facebook intends to achieve dominance in Russia with the help of game developers </h4><br>  Under the loud headline about domination, there is an idea to ensure the influx of new users by offering them a lot of games.  Such plans were <a href="http://siliconrus.com/2014/11/facebook-first/">voiced</a> by Julien Codornier, Facebook development manager for Europe. <br><br>  The idea seems dubious.  Especially considering that not so long ago, FB selected an instant messenger from its mobile application, arguing, including the fact that most users want to communicate, and so it will be easier for them to do so. <br><br>  It turns out a little inconsistently: FB claims that users need to communicate, but at the same time tries to lure new users with games. <br><br>  You can still understand the transition from one site with games to another, but the transition from one set of services and the environment of friends to another is much more difficult. <br><br>  We stock up on popcorn and watch the actions of the FB. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/243677/">https://habr.com/ru/post/243677/</a></p>
