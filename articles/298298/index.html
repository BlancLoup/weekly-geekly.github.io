  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who wants to be a millionaire: 7 ways to get rich without creating a company</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Millionaires are usually associated with businessmen, owners of their own companies, and startupers.  In Russia, however, some segments of the population still consider businessmen to be thieves, but the conversation is not about that now.  Millionaires can be outstanding politicians, actors, musicians, athletes and other "showmen." <br><br>  However, the discussion below will focus on how you can make a big fortune with mere mortals, as they say, in your free time.  If you do not want to create a company, do not want to be known outside the online and put your life on public display, then the following ways to enrich you will be interested. <br><br>  The publication Business Insider took care of your well-being and <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/creative-ways-to-make-a-million-dollars-2016-1">told the</a> world about seven such ways. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Personal blog </h4><br>  In the middle of 2013, Scott DeLong <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-viralnova-might-sell-2014-1">launched the</a> personal blog <a href="http://www.viralnova.com/">ViralNova</a> on each page placed several advertisements Google ad.  After 8 months, his annual revenue was estimated at more than $ 1 million.  Further, her estimate ranged between $ 1.2 and $ 4.8 million, depending on the level of traffic on the site.  DeLong achieved this by working alone, without third-party investments. <br><br>  In a blog, he published various stories with catchy headlines that caused a resonance and immediately fell on Facebook.  So, the number of monthly blog visitors has grown to 100 million. <br><br>  In 2015, DeLong sold its website to <a href="https://www.zealotnetworks.com/">Zealot Networks</a> for $ 100 million. <br><br><h4>  Virus application </h4><br>  In just three days, independent game developer from Vietnam, Dong Nguyen, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/flappy-bird-is-most-searched-for-game-according-to-google-2014-12">created the</a> most popular game of 2014, <a href="http://flappybird.io/">Flappy Bird</a> .  He said that he earned $ 50,000 a day, by placing an advertising banner in his free game.  For revenue to reach $ 1 million, the game had to last only 20 days on the App Store.  But she would have lasted there and more, if in a month the developer had not removed it herself. <br><br>  At the peak of popularity, the game disappeared from the app store.  Nguyen decided that the success of the game ruined his previous life as an ordinary indie game developer.  In addition, in his opinion, people play it too much.  The viral application caused a ‚Äúpainful‚Äù attachment of people. <br><br><h4>  Amazon Kindle Book Publishing </h4><br>  A few years ago, in 2011, Amanda Hawking <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amanda-hocking-2011-2">became</a> the best-selling writer in the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle">Amazon Kindle</a> store.  She was an independent author and had no contract with any publisher, so she got 70% of the sales of her books.  About 100 thousand copies were bought from her monthly for $ 1- $ 3.  As a result, the writer earned several million dollars. <br><br>  She is not the only successful independent author of books in the Amazon Kindle.  With money earned on Kindle sales, Bob Meier and Jen Tolty founded the publishing house for two years.  They told about this in their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0078WD60O/ref%3Das_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26camp%3D1789%26creative%3D9325%26creativeASIN%3DB0078WD60O%26linkCode%3Das2%26tag%3Dthepenhoa-20%26linkId%3DJ5WW5OKHHPFLNHWV">book</a> ‚ÄúHow we made our first million in the Kindle‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Monetizing your own YouTube channel </h4><br>  Making money on YouTube is not easy.  Even the "stars" with a million subscribers sometimes barely have enough money to make ends meet.  But if you manage to consistently produce really outstanding content and acquire a multimillion army of fans, consider that the job is done. <br><br>  One of the most successful figures in this regard, PewDiePie (his real name is Felix Chelberg), <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-stars-who-make-the-most-money-2015-10">earned</a> $ 12 million on YouTube.  Many other such personalities earn $ 1 million a year from advertising.  For example, a 9-year-old boy who <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/evantubehd-unboxing-youtube-star-2015-5">does</a> toy video reviews has a million subscribers and a billion views. <br><br><h4>  Crowdfunding </h4><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiegogo">Indiegogo</a> - crowdfunding platforms that allow you to raise money to implement their ideas.  If the community likes the idea, then there is a chance to collect an impressive amount. <br><br>  Many people repeatedly collected more than $ 1 million in crowdfunding.  One of the most successful crowdfunding campaigns is a fundraising to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_(watch)">Pebble Watch</a> .  Developers <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/5-guys-1-idea-and-10-million-may-have-changed-the-entire-trajectory-of-kickstarter-2012-5">received</a> $ 10 million in a few weeks. <br><br>  Now, Pebble watches compete with such smart watch manufacturers as <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Gear">Samsung</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Watch">Apple</a> . <br><br>  Of course, the collected funds can not then be put in his pocket.  Recently, crowdfunding platforms have paid particular attention to controlling the targeted use of funds and the fulfillment of other promises made by the project authors to backers. <br><br><h4>  Curriculum sale </h4><br>  In 2008, kindergarten teacher Dianna Jump started selling her own curriculum to other teachers through the <a href="http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/">TeachersPayTeachers</a> website.  She made 99 training programs and sold them for $ 8. <br><br>  In 2012, its revenues exceeded $ 1 million.  Every month she received $ 100 thousand from her small business.  This amount was almost twice her salary in kindergarten. <br><br><h4>  Innovative ideas "for a million" </h4><br>  <a href="https://www.quirky.com/">Quirky</a> website allows everyone to try their luck and offer their idea "for a million".  If you come up with an innovative project or solution, the platform can help you earn thousands or even millions of dollars.  She sells ideas through her affiliate network. <br><br>  Jake Zine was the first millionaire on the site.  In 2010, he placed there his idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa flexible mains filter for electrical outlets.  His project was called <a href="https://www.quirky.com/shop/44">Pivot Power</a> . <br><br>  There is no need to pay for posting ideas on Quirky.com.  But if it becomes interesting to someone and is taken for implementation, the author shares the profit with the site and the Quirky community.  If the idea is successfully implemented and the product is created, then the inventor gets 30% from online sales and 10% from his sales in regular stores. <br><br><h4>  Alternative to alternatives </h4><br>  If, by luck, your main work is related to the field of information technology, you can use a very straightforward strategy. <br><br>  "Megamind" previously <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/23680/">described</a> 10 IT skills that will bring an annual salary of more than 130 thousand dollars.  There is a chance to become at least a ruble millionaire.  Especially, given the growth of the dollar. <br><br>  True, this will have to get a job in the United States.  But Megamind <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/talentboard/blog/22144/">knows the</a> solution to this problem too. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298298/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298298/</a></p>
