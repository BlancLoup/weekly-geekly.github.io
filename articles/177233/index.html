Small report</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><blockquote>  <i>“Strike!” Is the triumph of common sense over the abyss of despondency and depression.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Vitalik Bykov, Redkeds.</i> </blockquote><br><br>  Not so long ago I wrote a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/175983/">post</a> about Ulyanovsk and the <a href="http://www.nastachku.ru/">All-Russian conference “Strike!”</a> , Which took place this weekend, April 12 and 13.  The technical and managerial sections were quite interesting.  Many technologies that are used in production in the city are covered.  However, this time taxis and marketers were driving.  And I, as a technical specialist, of course want to see more hardcore programming and hardened PMs.  By the way, there was information that in the summer the next Agile Camp will also be held in Ulyanovsk, which is very gratifying. <br><br>  I would particularly like to mention the reports “Big data: realtime data storage”, “Low-level optimizations” and “Scrum.  Why Retrospective dies first. ”  Got a lot of interesting ideas that will be useful on our projects.  I was distressed by the stand of Ulyanovsk State University, my alma mater.  Absolutely sad others presentations and videos that have already been a year.  Although I know that the university develops unique projects not only for Russia, but for the whole world.  In general, there is something to work on for the next year. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The program was extremely intense and regularly there was a desire to break into a couple of parts.  According to a colleague: “At the end of the day, I felt a load comparable to the day of work.  The first day was especially interesting.  By the second day, it seems to me, both the listeners and the speakers are a little tired. ”  In general, it was great and interesting, but 6 parallel tracks to cover one person is extremely difficult, so the word to my colleagues:

    <h5>  So, let me begin with the opinion of the chief - Nikolay Fetyukhin, director of MST digital agency: </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/809/1c6/e25/8091c6e2540bca3fe08ffebbe0934bb2.jpg"><br>  “Our company was responsible for the section“ Digital-communications ”: we formed the program, modeled and attracted visitors, and also entertained the speakers. <br>  We immediately set a goal to maintain high quality of content, at the level of the best conf, for this we used 3 simple techniques when forming the grid: <br>  - half of the content we offered to organize the AIA (Association of Interactive Agencies) - last year all their speakers were strong and attracted the most attention of the audience. <br>  - only those speakers were invited, whom we know well and heard personally - for example, the best speaker “Strikes!” - 2012 Alexey Ponomar, or well-known Grisha Kochenov, who always lights the audience’s eyes with his performances, or Katya Shukalov - in our opinion, one of the best speakers Runet. <br>  - reports from the 2.0 program were taken at a minimum (mostly those who were heard) and put them in the morning or evening, when the traffic of visitors to the conference decreases;  staged training sessions. <br><br>  We also wanted to reach the most relevant audience in the sections, for this we prepared several chips and promoted them separately: <br>  - made a separate list of reports recommended for non-IT people (who prevailed on the “Strike!”) And distributed it wherever they could. <br>  - Teglaine was persuaded to make a presentation of the Rating of Key Persons of the web development and digital market in our section and it was promoted additionally and separately from the main PR of the conference. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6a8/f33/d20/6a8f33d200f54e5b730a218e20d2e117.jpg"><br>  - Invented the “PASh Battle” at the end of the first day of the conference (usually the time to reduce traffic), which consisted of the presentation of two directly opposite reports from two odious Pashkov speakers, as well as a round table with the participation of all the “stars” of the section. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aee/897/373/aee89737376f38623e9b6f8fbea4d328.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/89b/d43/b90/89bd43b909d92e0ad5ec8eab4da1629f.jpg"><br>  - the sections were moderated by those presenters who were known to a wide audience: in the Cinema Hall, where non-technical reports were presented, it was me and Yevgeny Chernov, and in the second technical hall - Dima Vasilyev, a fan and adept "Strikes!". <br><br>  All this exceeded our expectations: <br>  - The content was strong, in reviews it was noted that this year DIGITAL surprised everyone;  many mentioned the excellent quality of the content and the “star” list of speakers; <br>  - The halls almost all the time were crowded 1.5-2 times, and even in the morning and evening of the traditional decline in traffic, the number of people in the halls did not fall below half their capacity <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e6b/a4b/980/e6ba4b9805ef2579acaa3099fa422b7f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/596/77e/bbf/59677ebbfc6e2c613336ce3009f05831.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/79f/786/823/79f7868234fac052750e09aa59e02eb0.jpg"><br>  “We fueled the interest in the DIGITAL section from the side of speakers and listeners so that everyone was mega prepared and disciplined, the audience was 100% relevant and relevant to the topic, so everyone was useful and fun.  Everyone understood each other. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a0/7ac/d4c/8a07acd4c5c839871e2adf56ce843100.jpg"><br><br>  Between the first and second days of the “Strikes!” There was a cool afterparty with female and male striptease.  Male, by the way, organized severe programmers <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc2/ce5/c01/bc2ce5c016a358bbe3f92b0b5b17852e.jpg"><br><br>  Therefore, it is now safe to say: “Strike!” Is a holiday, and not only for programmers, but also for advertisers working in the field of digital communications! ” <br><br><h5>  Our most pathetic employee, Evgeny Chernov, also shared his impressions with me: </h5><br><br>  “Last year I went to the“ Strike! ”, Full of mixed emotions, because it was the first time - a crowd of IT people gather in one place and threaten to discuss something, but I need to make a report on sales, oops! <br><br>  But a year has passed and I am again at the “Strike!”, Everything is already familiar, only the building has more than doubled: now it is the Lenin Memorial, and everything speaks of a “strike” in all senses - Lenin terms, red flags and other revolutionary symbolism.  More than 3,000 PEOPLE have registered, and this is the same 30 centurias of the Roman army, by the way! <br><br>  All those involved in communications in digital were allocated to the hotel section “Digital Communications”, moderated the section Nikolai Fetyukhin, Director of All MST DA, and Pavel Ivanov, Director of All CIA, and then I, Chernov Evgeny, Director of All Development = ) <br><br>  Because of my innate carelessness, I came to the “Strike!” When Ekaterina Shukalova already began her report on the topic “How to sell the development so that it would not be excruciatingly painful.”  I do not cease to be surprised at this girl, her never-ending pressure in reports;  Catherine said 100% the right things about the proper management of documents and the proper handling of clients, as well as about why our market was created, about meeting the needs of clients in the field of the Internet - many are already beginning to forget about this. <br><br>  As always, he didn’t do without Mr. Ezhikov from Kelnik’s studio, he was obliged to conclude Catherine’s report with his question-monologue, but for this we love him. <br><br>  It was already my time to speak here - to be honest, it’s always infinitely pleasant to speak in your hometown on your favorite topic of sales.  Especially when such cool guys like Danila Rassadin, Sergey Prokofyev (Creative People), Oleg Malakhov (Dr. JUNG) come to your report, and Egor Volkov and Sergey Melikhov (Green Sight) are crowding in the corridor and catch your words - it was , honestly) <br><br>  My report was simple, like the Udmurt song (more about the songs of Udmurtia here), it was called “How to win a tender from Lebedev”.  In it, I tried to convince the audience that it was necessary to sell the idea and develop the specific face of the company, which, in turn, would be able to sell itself as a person and have, as a result, the opportunity to sell everything connected with it.  Well, and also about related work such as cold calls, meetings and other things. <br><br>  Immediately after me, a wonderful girl from Magway Kalaus Nina’s studio began her wonderful presentation. She presented an excellent report “How to get big brands in the portfolio to a regional web studio”, starting the answer with an Epson case (I won’t talk about a studio from Volgograd, and the central office of Epson is also in Volgograd). <br><br>  “Strike!” Gave a wonderful opportunity to have lunch with two of the coolest designers - Danila Rassadin and Sergey Prokofiev.  It was very funny to watch two bearded dudes drinking martinis and reasoning on the subject of digital against the background of the dilapidated Volga stadium! <br><br>  Returning to konfu, I realized that I was made a moderator.  Serious uncle Sergey Melikhov was the first to go into battle with thoughts on the topic “How to increase studio efficiency by 53% percent”.  Of course, the experience of the guys from GreenSight in the organization of remote work is difficult to overestimate, they are really cool in this. <br><br>  Immediately behind him appeared Oleg Malakhov, his thoughts in the report “Setting up creative processes in the agency” gave rise to a discussion of the mechanics of interaction within the studio for almost half an hour.  Here it is, the real speaker - a story for 15 minutes, discussion - for half an hour! <br><br>  Who is there next?  And, well, how can it be without him, after drinking a beloved toperitant from a flask, like a whirlwind Sergei Prokofiev flew onto the stage - and then atsky legends about how cool to be Creative People flew.  Sergey told how to create really cool things, what to cut the cost, and noted that projects for the portfolio are made from the heart, and not for money. <br><br>  “So I got to you, Mr. Alexei Ezhikov with the report“ Risks in Internet projects: from an incoming call to project support ”, I thought and got ready to troll, but no - everything is on the topic, everything is correct;  as it turned out later on Aftepati - cool dude, I recommend everyone to chat with him. <br><br>  Here the reports ended, and a massacre began on the topic “Living Sites or They Will Be Eaten by Social Networks” performed by Pavel Ivanov and Pavel Trubetskova.  But this epic of our section did not end - a round table gathered, namely: Nikolai Fetyukhin, Alexey Ramensky, Alexander Scherbina, Pavel Trubetskov, Pavel Ivanov, Your obedient servant Chernov, Alexey Ponomar, Sergey Prokofiev, Yegor Volkov, Alexey Ezhikov - in general began mesilovo.  But, as always, starting with the fact that the sites will live forever, the debaters have come to the conclusion that everything will be incomprehensible =) <br><br>  The second day was remembered by the fact that I was almost not there, but then I saw Yurin and Bykov from the Red sneakers, and also Elena Stolbova’s presentation on the topic “Preproduction in mobile development”.  In general, it was really cool, waiting for the next “Strikes!” Hooray, comrades. <br>  In our group of companies there is also the creative agency “CIA”, which is also one of the organizers of “Strikes!”, And I, of course, asked them about the event: <br><br><h5>  Pavel Ivanov, director of the CIA, organizer and co-host of the conference: </h5><br><br>  “Strike!” I waited more than the New Year or my birthday, with some kind of childish anticipation of a holiday and a cool party.  My expectations were met "one hundred percent"!  It was really cool: thousands of people in one place, united by one idea of ​​IT development, make it easy to feel explosive energy.  I spoke with many participants and I want to note that I have not heard a single negative comment, both personally and on the Internet.  It is very nice when participants forgive us, the organizers, our minor flaws in the form of a queue for registration, boot covers in a museum or delayed the opening ceremony for 20 minutes.  I, as an advertiser, are pleased that at the exhibition each company tried to offer something interesting or useful to the participants: play Kinekt, take a picture on the background of world sights, shake the barbell or just relax on easy chairs, contemplating naked female forms.  Especially delivered performance in the form of the granny on one of the stands, reading the newspaper "Life". <br><br>  In connection with the total employment in the organization of konfy, I didn’t manage to really listen to any of the reports, but I think I’ll see everything in the record - there was an online broadcast on “Strike!” <br>  A party.  I always guessed that IT people were not really people ... But drunk IT people are supermen!  They drink buckets, dance a striptease, chase and discuss the world of IT-technologies.  It was very cool to hang out with them! <br>  In general, without exaggeration, I consider that the usefulness of “Strikes!” Is very difficult to overestimate. <br>  A separate song is the preparation of our agency for the event: in my instagram you can find a live report from the CIA "the night before the strike" and a no less exciting western as we collected parts of the "Strikes!" Throughout the city.  In general, my nickname in instagrame incrafter, if anyone is interested. <br><br>  “Strike!” Really cost hundreds of work hours, a week without sleep, and millions of nerve cells killed.  I promise that in a year “Strike!” Will be even cooler and more interesting! ” <br><br>  I also asked the opinion of the strike at Maxim Yurin from Redkeds.  They say he is one of the best SMM specialists in Russia: <br>  “I really liked the strike.  In my opinion, the halls with the busts of Lenin, Soviet flags, boot covers and red carpets are perfectly combined with digital strategies, kipiyayami and other cans.  Despite the fact that the conference is only two years old, she definitely has her own definite atmosphere, even, I would say, style.  And, of course, the scale!  You rarely meet conferences that are attended by 2-3 thousand people.  Keep it up, Ulyanovsk! ” </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/177233/">https://habr.com/ru/post/177233/</a></p>
