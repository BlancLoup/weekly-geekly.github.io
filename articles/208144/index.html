However, at that time there lived and worked a great (not afraid of this word) science fiction writer, thinker, scientist, popularizer of science and just a man Isaac Asimov.  In 1964, being impressed by the World's Fair, held in New York, he decided to imagine what the world would look like in half a century.  This year, 2014, it is exactly 50 years of this prediction, therefore, I propose to recall those Azimov predictions that came true. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Predictions are not arranged in order of priority, but randomly, it is not possible to rank them in order of importance, all these achievements are equally important.  At least most.

      1. After 50 years, most of the routine tasks will be shifted to the shoulders of technology.  In the kitchen, devices with the autogrowing function will work, which will cook toasts, cook eggs, fry bacon, and make coffee. <br><br>  Breakfast can be ordered already a day before the required time. <br><br>  2. In 2014, the world's population will reach 6.5 billion, and the US population will increase to 350 million. <br><br>  The region of Boston-Washington will merge into one metropolis with a population of 40 million people (this prediction has not come true yet). <br><br>  3. With regard to television, the wall screens will replace conventional television sets, in addition, there will be 3D TVs (here, however, not stereoscopic displays, which are not really something new, namely, surround TV). <br><br>  4. Communications will go far ahead, while you can see your interlocutor during a conversation.  Plus, the phones will be equipped with screens, and it will be possible to work with the screens not only to see the person, but also to perform other functions, such as reading books, notes, working with photos and images. <br><br>  Satellites will allow you to make calls from the end to the end of our planet, and for communication it will be enough just to dial the number. <br><br>  5. In 2014, certain types of work will be performed by machines better than any other person. <br><br>  6. Schools will be automated, and university students will be trained in computer science, in addition, they will study "computer languages" that will evolve from the current "Fortran" (from "formula translation"). <br><br>  7. Robots will not be very common in 2014, but they will be present in human life.  There will be miniature computers that serve as a ‚Äúbrain‚Äù for robots.  Probably, in the headquarters of IBM in 2014 will work a robot cleaner.  Slow, big robot, which, however, will be able to perform the usual tasks of cleaners. <br><br>  In 2014, General Electric will show 3D films of the Robot of the Future series. <br><br>  8. Posters will be replaced by glowing wall advertising. <br><br>  9. Society in 2014 will be a ‚Äúsociety of compulsory rest,‚Äù and boredom will become a real problem for people of the future.  There will be a large number of diseases associated with mental disorders, and psychiatry will become a very important area of ‚Äã‚Äãmedicine. <br><br>  10. Many products based on algae and microorganisms will appear.  In 2014 there will be bars with products from algae, for example, ‚Äúpseudo‚Äù.  An important step will be to overcome the psychological barrier that prevents a person from starting to treat artificial products as well as natural ones. <br><br>  Agree, these predictions, as they say, "not in the eyebrow, in the eye."  Much has come true, but there is something that is still to come - for example, the wide distribution of vehicles hovering over the road (something like an air bag). <br><br>  A complete list can be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/23/lifetimes/asi-v-fair.html">found here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/208144/">https://habr.com/ru/post/208144/</a></p>
