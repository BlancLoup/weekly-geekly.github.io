  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Open data in Russia. Preparing priorities for government agencies. Poll</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many of you know that in Russia, the authorities are actively engaged in open data and, in addition to the already published arrays, such as open databases from the sites zakupki.gov.ru, bus.gov.ru and the FIAS system (fias.nalog.ru) and are now actively work on making open data an order of magnitude larger. <br><br>  For those who still have not heard about this phenomenon, a small excursion. <br><br>  <b>What is open data?</b> <br>  Open data is machine-readable data accessible to a wide range of people (the public), suitable for automatic re-use and without licensing, technological, legal and other restrictions on their use.

      In most developed countries of the world, open data and, in particular, open government data are part of the public policy of national governments.  Governments publish data online on special portals, such as portals such as data.gov.uk in the UK or data.gov.au in Australia and data.govt.nz in New Zealand.  Such portals are in more than 60 countries and their total number is more than 150. <br><br>  Data availability allows you to: <br><br>  - public organizations - to monitor the activities of the authorities <br><br>  - to business - to create new and develop existing information products <br><br>  - programmers - to have the opportunity (‚Äúfuel for ideas‚Äù) in creating new programs <br><br>  - citizens - to be able to use the programs created to increase personal comfort <br><br>  - state and municipal authorities - to attract citizens and businesses to create new products that save public funds <br><br>  In fact, Open Data is an opportunity for developers to change and improve the state, to consider it as a platform for creating their own services. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>What should be done to open data appeared in Russia?</b> <br><br>  First of all, it is necessary to help the officials to understand what data is in demand and what you, as developers, are ready to create on their basis.  For our good luck with the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia, the ministry responsible for open data in our country is ready to listen to us and is interested in proposals on what kind of data, exactly how and with what priority should be published. <br><br>  In order for these proposals to collect HSE launches a poll in which all the questions that are necessary for the reasoned conviction of the authorities that these data are necessary for all citizens are collected.  As part of the HSE team, which develops the open data concept for the Ministry of Economic Development, I urge officials to disclose as much data as possible and to do so in accordance with W3C standards.  And publish the survey we prepared here. <br><br>  <b>Questions</b> <br><br>  The survey contains the following questions: <br><br>  1. In what directions should the state ensure open data? <br><br>  2. What open data do you find most interesting?  Write one or more data arrays <br><br>  3. What services or applications are you ready to create or improve if the data is open? <br><br>  4. What directions of development of data openness do you consider the most priority? <br><br>  5. Are you ready to participate as an expert in the working groups on data openness under the authorities, the Government and expert organizations involved in the formation of plans for data disclosure? <br><br>  6. The most priority data arrays.  Choose the ones that you consider the highest priority for you and the society as a whole. <br><br>  I ask you not only to take part in the survey - <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/MJCNNMY">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/MJCNNMY</a> and answer all questions, but also to disseminate information about it as widely as possible to all developers you know. <br><br>  If you have any questions, suggestions that are beyond the scope of this survey and a willingness not only to actively use open data, but also to take part in events dedicated to them - send them to <a href="">ibegtin@w3c.org.ru</a> <br><br>  PS I will also add that in the Russian office of W3C we put a lot of effort into ensuring that the Semantic Web, RDF and Linked Data become the most likely direction for the development of open state data in Russia.  In order for our efforts to be more effective, we lack sufficient examples of how the data in the RDF are used and can be used in Russia.  I will be glad to receive from you examples of the use of RDF in Russia and we will certainly communicate them to those responsible for publishing open data from our authorities. <br><br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  Ivan Begtin <br><br>  Director of Linked Data in the Russian office of W3C <br>  <a href="http://w3c.org.ru/">w3c.org.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151446/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151446/</a></p>
