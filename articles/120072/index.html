  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The myth of high power android-communicator</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many times I met android charges of excessive consumption of battery power, and even Internet traffic.  If everything is clear with the second one, I would like to dwell on the first one in detail and figure out where the precious charge actually flows. <br>  On the Internet, you can meet numerous tips and even instructions on how to reduce the power consumption of your android device, but to the detriment of its functionality.  I would like to conduct my ‚Äúoptimization‚Äù without sacrificing functionality and to measure the time of autonomy in different scenarios of using the communicator. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Take, for example, the instruction of "energy saving" from the site w3bsit3-dns.com.  It boils down to a few things: <br><h6>  - disable all synchronization services <br>  - disable background data transfer <br>  - disable all programs that can download data in the background. <br>  - Avoid any programs running in background mode. <br>  - disable mobile internet <br>  - switch the phone from 3G to EDGE mode <br>  <s>- throw out your communicator and buy a regular dialer</s> </h6><br>  Personally, this state of affairs did not suit me at all, why would I need a communicator if I turn off all the functionality from it?  Let's try to figure out how to leave the functionality and save the charge. <br><br><h4>  Let's start in order </h4><br><h5>  Synchronization </h5><br>  Go to the section "Accounts and sync" what we see? <br>  - <b>Facebook</b> (Sync avatars, phone numbers, contacts, statuses) <br>  I need all this, but it is enough to synchronize once a day. <br>  - <b>Google</b> (Contacts, GMAIL, Calendar, Google Reader) <br>  Everything you need ... <br>  - <b>HTC Sense</b> <br>  Here, finally, you can adjust "to taste" and chop off unnecessary.  I have cut off the HTC Hub, the rest is included. <br>  - <b>Skype</b> (Contacts) <br>  I do not have a lot of Skype conat, chopped off. <br>  - <b>Twitter</b> <br>  Customize to taste, I have included. <br>  - <b>Promotions</b> (a certain bonus from HTC) <br>  Chopped off <br>  - <b>VKontatke</b> (contacts, phone numbers, avatars, statuses) <br>  Useful information, let him synchronize <br>  - <b>News</b> (bonus from HTC) <br>  Not interested, I use google reader, its synchronization service is included above. <br>  - <b>Weather</b> (HTC Widget) <br>  I use, turn on, update every 3 hours.

    <h5>  Background data transfer. </h5><br>  Disabling it, we disable the technology Push.  What are we going to lose with this technology? <br>  In order: <br>  - Receiving mail in near real time (usually 5-10 seconds).  If you decide to read all the same on the computer, it does not matter, on the device the notification itself will disappear, and the letter will become read after a while. <br>  - Instant installation of applications from the android market (click "install" in the browser and the application is already loaded on your device). <br>  - Messages from GoogleTalk.  Someone wrote to you on GoogleTalk on your home computer, and you are not at home?  It does not matter, the message has already been mirrored on your communicator, even if GoogleTalk is not running (I must admit it is working and sometimes the message is delayed up to an hour). <br>  - Expansion for Google Chrome "Chrome to Phone".  Did you like the picture and want it on the desktop of your device?  Click the second mouse button to send to your phone, it already opens in the browser.  (Similarly, you can download a file or music, or copy a snippet of text to the clipboard of your device). <br>  Conveniently?  Yes, perhaps worth leaving. <br>  Go to the rest of the programs. <br>  To track parasite programs, we analyze the consumed traffic and processor time of all programs.  I used for this free software from the <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dnextapp.systempanel">SystemPanel</a> market and <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.trafficstats%26feature%3Dsearch_result">Network TrafficStats</a> . <br>  By removing unnecessary programs that were wasting resources, they replaced energy-intensive ones with analogues. <br>  Before optimization, there were applications that do not understand what they were spending several minutes of CPU time.  Now the main CPU time is spent on dynamic wallpaper and the HTC Sence itself. <br><br><h6>  Transfer phone to GSM mode </h6><br>  It disappears for the reason that if you use the Internet and try to reach you at that moment, it will be ‚Äúbusy‚Äù.  We will not allow such troubles. <br><br><h4>  Go to measurement </h4><br>  We have HTC Desire Z with Mugen Power 1800 mAh standard size battery. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/59/51/595174705080afce08b695cc30e0b04f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Settings: <br>  <b>Wi-fi</b> - off. <br>  <b>Bluetooth</b> off <br>  <b>GPS</b> - incl.  (Is always) <br>  <b>Mobile internet</b> enabled (always) <br>  <b>Brightness</b> - 33% (completely comfortable in any light, except in direct sunlight is not very) <br>  Also used dynamic wallpaper. <br>  As practice shows, the included ‚Äúin the background‚Äù GPS does not take away the charge, it is taken away only if it is being used, so why switch it once more? <br>  Wi-fi - If you are surrounded by access points with the presence of the Internet, I recommend to keep it turned on for the simple reason that if the phone goes to the Internet via Wi-Fi, and not 3G, it will save you battery power.  (in practice, at home with Wi-Fi enabled, it lives much longer). <br>  My result is <b>40+ hours</b> (downloading mail, synchronizing news, weather, avatrki and statuses of friends) <br>  Not much you say?  It is enough to sit on the Internet for 3 hours \ play while quietly returning home at night and put on exercise. <br>  But in order to return to the title of the article and answer the question of where the energy is spent, we will make only one change. <br><br><h5>  DISABLE THE INTERNET </h5><br>  Let's go into the work scenario ‚Äúif you need mail, turn on the Internet‚Äù, unfortunately I could not put my device on the shelf and not use at least some of its functionality for as long as ... 4 days.  Yes, yes, no podcasts to you on the road and music.  Energy consumption was reduced to an alarm clock in the morning (not once), calls totaling just over 4 Minutes, about 20sms.  Unfortunately, sometimes there was a need for mail, searching for information on the Internet, DUBLGIS (to get from where I was), about 40 minutes a day android fixed the on screen (recall, 33% brightness), the total was over 2 hours 30 minutes <br><h6>  The test result for the indications of the system: </h6><br>  <b>Charge:</b> 3% <br>  <b>Time off charge:</b> 94 hours 40 minutes <br>  <b>Activity time:</b> 5 hours 3 minutes <br>  <b>Screen time:</b> 2 hours 36 minutes <br>  Considering that, usually a device with enabled screens works for me 3.5-4.5 hours depending on the load, 90 hours is not the limit in this mode, according to my calculations (90 * 4.5 / 2.5) you can count on <b>at least a week of ‚Äústandby mode‚Äù</b> , and this we just cut off the Internet, the services themselves are in place and they periodically ‚Äúwake up‚Äù the phone with the demand of the Internet. <br><br><h6>  Total: </h6><br>  Dispose of the possibilities android wisely!  Misuse of its capabilities (both programmers and users) has unpleasant consequences. <br>  I hope my article will help you properly dispose of the charge of your device;) <br><br><h5>  Addition + generalization: </h5><br><h6>  By optimization </h6><br>  1) decide on the functionality that you will use.  Set the appropriate settings. <br>  2) leave the phone to work for a few hours, using the programs mentioned in the article, then look at the consumption of processor time and traffic, if there are abnormally high rates for some programs, replace them with analogues or refuse to use them. <br><br>  Example: there are at least two synchronization programs with VKontakte on the market, one of them is consuming a battery, this can be seen from the readings.  My friend accidentally put on this program, immediately noticed subjectively (!) increased battery consumption. <br>  If one kosyachny program can noticeably discharge the battery, it is necessary to monitor such programs. <br><br>  Fact 1: If you cut off all the functionality, updates, synchronization, etc.  android lives like a normal phone. <br>  Fact 2: If you turn on all synchronization, the consumption of 3G and the processor reduces the battery life to about 40 hours. <br>  Fact 3: If you actively use android lives 3.5-5 hours. <br>  Conclusion: Energy is consumed not by android, but by specific functions, android lives no less / no more than other OS, if identical functionality is implemented. <br><br>  Yes, I also want 10 hours in intensive workload, but this cannot be achieved so far, not because of the android, but because of the imperfection of technologies (screens, iron, batteries). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120072/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120072/</a></p>
