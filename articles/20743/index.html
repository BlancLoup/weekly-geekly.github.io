The authors proposed algorithms for creating "easily remembered" or "easy-to-type passwords."  I offer a different way and convenient tool. </p><br><br><p>  I do not worry about the convenience of remembering or typing passwords, I prefer to keep my head free from such things.  I have almost 150 passwords (email, ICQ-Shmaski, hosting, statistics, services), and none of them is repeated.  Passwords themselves look like this: <strong>96DtL`yL \, BC # @ 2w'QEP</strong> </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><p>  Pounding horror, right?  But entering such a password takes me a second and a half, and I have never made typos in them. </p>

    <p>  Once I was skeptical of various password keepers.  There were five passwords, they were easily remembered.  But gradually the passwords became more and more, and once the quantity turned into quality.  And even with friends began to divert massively different accounts. </p><br><br><p>  It is time to organize this business.  If we write down the passwords, then do it so that it is convenient and secure.  I went through a lot of software and made a choice that I was pleased with. </p><br><br><p>  But first I‚Äôll tell you about some of the criteria that guided me when organizing the storage of passwords. </p><br><br><h2>  Security </h2><br><ol><li>  <strong>Passwords must be long and complicated.</strong>  In a safe lock, the main thing is its stamina, not pleasantness to the eye. </li><li>  <strong>Passwords should not be repeated.</strong>  Otherwise, having gotten one password, the attacker will gain access to a bunch of different places. </li><li>  <strong>Passwords should be stored in encrypted form.</strong>  Locking the safe, do not throw away the keys. </li></ol><br><br><h2>  Convenience </h2><br><ol><li>  Passwords are long and complicated, but this should not bother me.  Therefore, the password keeper should allow you to copy and paste the password, immediately clearing the clipboard. </li><li>  Need a generator of long and complex passwords.  This work is perfectly done by a car, why should I strain? </li><li>  Passwords must be with me.  I used to remember passwords, they were in my head.  Now I do not remember.  The program should allow you to work not only on a laptop, but also on my handheld or cell phone. </li></ol><br><br><h2>  What did i choose </h2><br><p>  I rummaged through a bunch of programs.  Some did not have a version for the handheld, others braked, in the third ‚Äúprettiness‚Äù, such as a credit card image, they killed the desire to use them (and this was paid software).  The program I chose is called <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> .  Here are some of its advantages: </p><p></p><ul><li>  Comfortable.  And there are no ugly "credit cards" in the interface. <br>  There are programs for Windows, Linux and Mac. <br>  There are programs for Pocket PC, phones with Java and even for Blackberry. <br>  Convenient and customizable password generator. <br>  Supports Twofish and AES with a 256-bit key. <br>  In addition to the master password, you can also restrict access to the key file. <br>  The master password is protected by the SHA-256 function. <br>  Allows you to work with multiple password databases. <br>  There is a search and sorting database passwords. <br>  Multilingual interface, there is a Russian version. <br>  Copied the password, pasted, and KeePass cleared the buffer behind it. <br>  Passwords are protected even in memory. <br>  You can export passwords to XML, TXT, CSV, HTML, if necessary. <br>  You can also import passwords, which facilitates the migration from sloppy software. <br>  Can work with flash drives. <br>  Free and legal. <br>  Open source, plugins and all that. <br></li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20743/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20743/</a></p>
