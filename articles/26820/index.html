  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Piwik is a free open source alternative to Google Analytics.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Google Analytics may be a free platform, but it is still based on proprietary technology, which assumes that from time to time you will have to receive messages that Google deems necessary to send, and the potential audience of some of these newsletters are users of other Google services (for example, using AdWords).  Using Google Analytics suggests that in the future you will be tired of working with Google. Pay attention to <a href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a> , a project that is positioned as a free alternative to Google Analytics and has open source code.  This is a child of OpenX, an alternative open-source contextual search server that can replace Google Ad Manager.  [note: we started using it on RWW] <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/b7d/693/092/b7d693092add07a805f735ba2e195dc6.jpg" width="150" height="58" alt="Piwik" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  While OpenX has proven itself successful and popular, Piwik - is the project still frankly green?  and users are just eyeing this platform.  Was it first introduced to the public as PHPMyVisites?  and the current version carries an index of only 0.1.5, which is the hallmark of software stability. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Piwik's homeland is France, but this project is mainly interested in users from the USA.  It is planned that the platform will become popular in Japan, China and Europe.  It is said that the developers of Piwik are immigrants from such large companies as Amazon, Intel and even Google. <br><br>  Piwik assumes the use of PHP and MySQL.  This is not a problem for specialists, but a mass version is needed for a wide range of users.  Some companies offer something similar.  You will also need plugins for WordPress and other blogger platforms, all this is easily solved. <br><br>  Open source products usually become popular, even though they are often raw.  All this is justified by the fact that alternative solutions are quite expensive and impose certain restrictions on you.  Google Analytics is absolutely free software, so blogging and small advertising companies are unlikely to stop working with Google.  Most likely, this will be done by large companies that use expensive services Coremetrics, Omniture and Visual Sciences / Websidestory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/7e0/713/cb0/7e0713cb037250df17e1909c447c9560.jpg" width="450" height="351" alt="Piwik statistics example" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Large companies will think a bit before switching to Google Analytics.  IT department analysts will find at least 2 reasons for this kind of thought.  All because of the user agreement (yes, in large companies you MUST read this information): <br><br>  ‚Äú2.  PAYMENT FOR SERVICES.  In accordance with article 15 of this agreement, the service is provided to you free of charge with a limit of 5 million page views per month for one account.  If you have a valid agreement with AdWords, the Service is provided to you free of charge without restrictions on the number of visits to the page. <br><br>  Google has the right to change the tariffs for the provision of services by the Service from time to time.  The cost of services may include Google's costs associated with the location of the consumer of services, with the import of search engine data and other costs of Google or costs of subsidiaries owned by Google that are associated with third parties, cooperation with which is necessary to add data to the Service reports. ". <br><br>  So, in order not to pay Google for AdWords, you just need not exceed the limit of 5 million page views per month.  But the fact that ‚ÄúGoogle has the right to change the tariffs for the provision of services by the Service from time to time‚Äù can serve as an incentive for the IT department and the legal department to refuse such a deal. <br><br>  Next item: <br><br>  ‚Äú6.  COPYRIGHT AND ADVERTISING.  In accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Policy (published at <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html">www.google.com/privacy.html</a> or any other link that Google may report from time to time), Google and its wholly owned subsidiaries may collect and use information that will be available when you use the Service.  Google will not share your personal data or data related to your site to third parties except: <br><br>  1. If you have received your consent to the disclosure of this data <br>  2. Unless otherwise provided by law, or if access to this information, its security or disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property and security of Google, Google users or the public. <br>  3. If third party access to this information under certain conditions is necessary for third parties to fulfill their obligations to Google (for example, statistics accounting or data storage services).  However, third parties are only entitled to use this information to fulfill obligations to Google.  After fulfilling their obligations to Google, they use information based on the instructions of Google, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and take measures necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the information received ‚Äù <br><br>  In short, they have the right to use your data.  For a long time we lived in a world where Microsoft and other companies were forced to pay for software and very tightly controlled intellectual property rights, but they never tried to get the right to use data about you.  Google decided to go further.  Google is happy to give you the right to use their software for free, but only in return they ask for the right to use your personal information.  Individuals and small firms may come to terms with this, but this is absolutely unacceptable for large companies. <br><br>  In Pikwik, painstaking work is being done to become a friendly company for its users, moreover, relying not only on the openness of the program code.  They declare 4 merits of their product: <br><br>  1. Open application programming interface <br>  2. Plugin-Enabled Architecture <br>  3. Working with abstract data types <br>  4. Customizable toolbar <br><br>  However, the decisive factor for most large companies will be a non-disclosure agreement.  That is why Piwik is positioned as an alternative to Google Analytics, even if at first only a few firms refuse to cooperate with GA.  In IT departments, due to cost reduction requirements, they are likely to turn their attention to Google Analytics as an alternative to currently used analytic applications and reject solutions based on TOS constraints.  And some clever people will enter into the Google search engine a query ‚Äúan alternative to google analytics with open source code‚Äù and see Piwik at the very top of the search results. <br><br>  Material taken from the site <a href="http://dirti.ru/">http://dirti.ru/</a> , the original news in English <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/piwik_google_analytics_alternative.php">http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/piwik_google_analytics_alternative.php</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26820/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26820/</a></p>
