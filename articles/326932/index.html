      The easiest case was in Belarus.  There simply ‚Äúknocked out traffic jams‚Äù a couple of times a day.  Residential building, our store on the ground floor.  Automatic at the entrance with intercom.  We need to work, but during the day the tenants do not bother all this - they are at work, sleeping or preparing.  Avid gamers, judging by the absence of broken mice in the trash bin, was not.  Sellers were the first who went inside to turn on the machine.  I must say, they showed good skills of social engineering, because every time they had to get into the staircase without a key.  They also learned how to persist reflexively after each successful action, they learned the full power of a 15-minute incremental backup.  The most disciplined users of all retail.  One day, the light shattered three times in a row, and at that moment it began to come up that something had to change.  As a result, our electrician arrived, put a new automatic machine in place of the failed one, and everyone felt good. <br><br>  On Taganskaya we were cut food due to the fact that the street was being renovated.  The city decided that we desperately need to make a wide sidewalk and a flat road.  And the shutdown began.  Long, savory and hopeless.  The store generally fell out of business - no cash register, no computer.  If outside of Moscow at UTII it was still possible to issue paper checks (or even do without them), then there is a cash desk in the capital.  Yes, the cash register can work in manual mode without a computer, yes, there are devices with batteries - but we don‚Äôt put these in stores.  It is assumed that the ups are enough for basic things, and if the light is turned off, the shift can be closed.  Repair nobody foresaw.  The lights were turned off unevenly and randomly, so the sellers had to stand in a shift ‚Äî suddenly, in the evening, it would work again. <br><br>  Thus, candles and an intimate atmosphere were formed in the store, the ‚ÄúMercury‚Äù was pulled up on batteries.  We tried to push the power supply from the neighbors through the extension system so that it was enough for the cash desk and the computer - thanks to the residents of the house further down the street, they helped.  But in the end, I had to bring a gas generator, since the back of the store has a service exit to the courtyard, where a suitable pit was found.  The generator was enough not only for the cashier's workplace, but also for three LED floor lamps - no longer pulling.  In the afternoon, the still-open door saved a lot. <br><br>  So the sysadmin had a gas generator for such cases, a mobile set of equipment (two ‚Äúlong-running‚Äù laptops with do-accumulators and cash registers with AA batteries, which are used at mobile fairs).  Repeating is not worth it: since July 1, the trick with ‚ÄúMercury‚Äù will not work, the ticket office should be online from the point, but this is all solved.  More precisely, it is possible to provide data from the 115F model ( <i>‚ÄúCCP works according to the parameters that are configured in it. And if there is no connection, all data is stored in the fiscal drive for 30 calendar days (clause 4 of Article 4.1 of Law No. 54- Law No. 290-FZ.) After 30 days, the CCP will be blocked ‚Äù</i> ), but our old one will have to be thrown out, it is not being upgraded already. <br><br>  On the Golden Babylon, we shook ourselves - the accountant hung up a bunch of payments in the queue, but it was pay day, and there was a shortage on that particular account.  Two documents did not pass, one - about the payment.  No one noticed that there was no seal ‚Äúmade by the bank‚Äù on the payment - they sent the administration of the shopping center.  They are this payment, of course, or in the tooth foot, so they just pulled the switch.  It was impossible to get through to the local AHO, so I had to go.  Many people were killed, but managed to figure it out.  Stood like idiots without light for 21 hours. <br><br>  On the Kursk store on the ground floor in the subway building.  Hrenak!  There is no light.  Sellers thought that the third world war had begun, because this is a really metro building.  Called everyone you know.  Office some time later found out that an accident occurred on the tower.  4 hours from the shift directly blown away. <br><br>  On Paveletskaya, once a year, the lights are turned off for two hours.  Why - no one knows. <br><br>  Another mall was disconnected when it was completely indebted to the city.  You can‚Äôt put a petrol generator in there, so sit down and play Jangu to the touch, with no options. <br><br>  We also have a subsidiary project, a window in the food court in the shopping center.  We sell macaroni, we study, we beat about a rake there.  Supervised by Slava, the former chief in events.  The system difference from the main business with the board is that the game does not require a refrigerator.  She does not care.  If the light goes out, there will simply be no buyers.  And Glory also products will die an agonizing death.  Especially the meat. <br><br>  For the first time it was cut on December 19th.  You come to the food court - and there it is dark, scary and there is nobody, just 60 thousand direct losses in a few hours.  Well at least they do not steal - when they turn off the power in the shopping center, sometimes jewelers start to panic. <br><br>  The administration then said that the first time was due to construction work on the ZIL territory. <br><br>  So, imagine: the traffic light is not working nearby, in the banks of the Technopark, too, the windows are not lit.  Buyers are organized, without creating panic, taken out of the shopping center.  Restaurants cry bitterly and prepare to bury meat in the trash with all the honors.  And Glory of the events.  We have animators as special forces, only good ones.  Therefore, in 10 minutes he found a refrigerator and called him to the parking lot for rent. <br><br>  Repeating this experience will be very difficult - they have a schedule and a queue of orders, but you can find a passenger car with a refrigerator for delivering products.  You can also order food ice and shove it in the refrigerator (but dry ice for food is not allowed).  In general, there are options, and Glory saved products.  Awesome owners of other public catering looked at him like a prophet.  Then they wrote a statement asking them to connect a generator on the floor - they refused.  Then put the experience of putting products in the fridge of another mode.  With the help of the administrator Valera, who is already <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/312258/">familiar to</a> you, with a bag of sensors and a burden for experiments, it turned out that if the large camera shows -23, then in 6 hours the temperature rises to -5.  During this time, you can find out the duration of the work and call the refrigerator to the parking lot, or just wait it out. <br><br>  The funniest thing is to turn the power back on.  The chain is cut in cascade in stages, and at this moment the ‚ÄúWho is faster‚Äù competition begins.  Because people let in immediately with the first portion of the current.  Fast loading restaurant is a special art. <br><br>  <b>The process now is this:</b> when the channel falls off, Zabbix is ‚Äã‚Äãnotified on the screen of alarm events.  The router itself raises the backup channel and tries to go to it.  If the connection with the agency copy of Zabbiks is lost, the notification already comes directly to the administrator.  The store itself, as a rule, just at this time calls the operators and asks not to put on them self-pickup.  A support begins to figure out what and how - most often by calling the landlord and city services.  After 5-25 minutes, the UPS ends (depending on what they are protecting), this is enough for correct closing of the shift at the checkout.  Now we are winning the cache on the site, so that it is possible to promptly hang up almost from the monitoring information that the store does not plow. <br><br>  In Moscow, the light is cut down relatively rarely, but this is critical.  In St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, Ufa, too, good infrastructure.  But in smaller cities there can be anything, including scheduled outages on a working day every 3-6 months.  But there the process is simpler because of the UTII. <br><br>  And only once in all the time, we laughed like demons.  We come to the food court to Slava - and there is a huge line for us, the cooks do not have time at all, the cashier opens and closes the drawer with the speed of sound.  It turned out that only part of consumers were disconnected, and KFC, Teremok and Potatoes got into their list from the food court.  The result is a daily plan for 3 hours, and this is before the evening peak of the hungry after work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326932/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326932/</a></p>
