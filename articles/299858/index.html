Soon, the newspaper‚Äôs owner, Jeff Bezos (No. 1 among the world's biggest leaders), arrived there to deliver Rezayan home.  ‚ÄúThis is an inevitable part of the mission of our newspaper: to send our correspondents to a hostile environment,‚Äù says Mr. Bezos of Resayan, who was detained while working in Iran.  ‚ÄúAnd what happened to Jason and his wife, Edgie, is absolutely unfair and wrongful, simply outrageous.  I thought it would be an honor to take him home. <br><br>  I dined with them at night at the military base where I spent the night;  then the next day, when Jason was released after a detailed account of what happened, I asked him: ‚ÄúWhere would you like to go?‚Äù  I will take you to any place you wish. "And he said:" How about Key West? "I, of course, answered:" No problem! "And we flew away.  I left them in Key West.  Jason and Edgie had been married for just over a year when he went to prison.  And now they have something like the second honeymoon. ‚Äù

When asked if he wanted to demonstrate something with his personal involvement in the situation with his employee, Bezos answered: ‚ÄúI did it at the moment for Jason.  My motivation is extremely simple.  But I would be happy if, as a result, people understand that we will never leave anyone. ‚Äù <br><br>  Unusually sunny in the morning for mid-March in Seattle;  The financial situation of Mr. Bezos seems just as cloudless and rosy.  Who can blame him?  Amazon‚Äôs market value is $ 260 billion ( <a href="http://fortune.com/fortune500/amazon-com-29/">AMZN Œî 0.82%</a> ), Mr. Bezos ‚Äôshare is $ 46 billion. The company continues to grow: sales increased by 20% last year, reaching $ 107 billion, and the company pleased investors with an operating profit of 2.2 billion dollars (12-fold increase compared with 2014).  The Washington Post newspaper, an idol that slid down before Bezos bought it in 2013 for $ 250 million, is full of new ideas.  Even Blue Origin, a secret rocket company founded personally by Bezos, gained fame after it promised to arrange a space tour in a few years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a03/4f2/4c9/a034f24c94c50e6cd0c15096fa08515f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To say that all this makes Bezos to worry would be an understatement.  Dressed in jeans and a motley shirt with sleeves rolled up to the elbows, enjoying a certain fame thanks to its energy, this CEO is the embodiment of the ability to be content with what we have.  He demonstrates his signature clucking - the sound equivalent of Steve Jobs' black turtleneck - without any complexes.  Bezos says: ‚ÄúI dance as I enter the office every morning.‚Äù <br><br>  He has all the reasons for the cha-cha-cha.  Recently, Bezos has more rights on this than, perhaps, at any other time during two decades of his being under the scrutiny of the media.  His company expands internationally and distributes its diverse product and service offerings in unexpected new directions.  Bezos is also developing.  Having a reputation as an always aggressive competitor and a decisive organizer, he began to show his other side.  With the acquisition of the Washington Post, he found himself in the arena of public life, along with other leaders.  And thanks to his various projects, Bezos is also becoming known as a businessman with strategic thinking on topics different from inventing new ways to tidy up the profits of many opponents of Amazon. <br><br>  Bezos is strikingly consistent.  He still preaches a customer orientation and a ‚Äúperspective‚Äù approach.  Yet out of necessity, since Amazon became an extremely large business ‚Äî and since Bezos did not deny himself the pleasure of doing his eclectic and time-consuming other things ‚Äî he became the leader who empowers others.  ‚ÄúHe was at the center of everything at the beginning.  The leader was Jeff Bezos, ‚Äùsays Patty Stonesiefer, formerly Microsoft Executive Director ( <a href="http://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-31/">MSFT Œî 0.62%</a> ) and CEO of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, who has been on the board of Amazon for 19 years. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNow his activity cannot be displayed as the actions of the organizer, located in the center and issuing instructions in all directions to the performers.  He has become an outstanding leader for leaders. ‚ÄùIndeed, his evolution foreshadows significant consequences everywhere: the possibilities of the less limited Jeff Bezos equally arouse interest (imagine what he will do) and scare (sorry for those he crushes). <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúNow, the activity of Bezos cannot be displayed as an action of the organizer, located in the center and issuing instructions in all directions to the performers.</b>  <b>He has become an outstanding leader for leaders. ‚Äù</b> <br>  <i>- Patty Stonesifer, one of the directors of Amazon for 19 years</i> <br><br><h4>  Ii. </h4><br>  Editor Marty Baron discusses how the Washington Post newspaper changed after Bezos became its owner.  The conversation took place on a windy day in February in Washington, DC, a couple of days before Baron flew to Los Angeles to attend the Oscars.  I must say that the film about the team of journalists fighting for truth and justice in the newspaper ‚ÄúBoston Globe‚Äù, where Baron was then an editor, won the Oscar as the best film.  Baron, by the way, is exactly the same as the actor Lev Schreiber, who played Baron in the film: a strict, serious and at the same time sharp-minded newspaperman. <br><br>  Baron is sitting in the new Washington headquarters of the newspaper at a small table in his not very luxurious office, which, by its elegance, is more like a lobbyist's office than a harsh basement of a typographic typesetter.  According to him, Bezos‚Äôs main editorial contribution was ‚Äúto push us to the realization that life in the world of the Internet is different from life in the world of printing machines.‚Äù <br><br>  Dissatisfaction, for example, with the fact that the sites of the ‚Äúaggregators‚Äù had more online traffic, summarizing the ‚ÄúWashington Post‚Äù articles than the newspaper itself received for its original articles, the newspaper itself became a skillful aggregator itself, ‚Äúlaying up‚Äù, according to Baron, own reports.  Bezos approved funding for the PostEverything website, similar to the Huffington Post, for experts to publish their opinions.  (Some people write for free, others pay for the newspaper.) Then a new ‚Äútalent network‚Äù of the newspaper appeared - a highly automated web product linking the publication with 800 freelance journalists in the United States, which can be ordered in seconds articles. <br><br>  Baron compares this network with information technology innovations like Mechanical Turk from Amazon, TaskRabbit and Uber.  ‚ÄúWe are not in the condition that we can reconstruct the old model of our units across the country,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúand it‚Äôs unclear whether it is the most practical and effective way to solve our tasks.‚Äù <br>  Honestly, it is frustrating to listen to such a ‚Äúmaster‚Äù of American journalism, eloquently speaking of the superiority of the ‚ÄúHuffington Post‚Äù, who disregards the need for a wide network of its own correspondents and tells how the Washington Post takes advantage of other sites.  Is he, in fact, right with all this modern, journalistic dubious product offered to readers?  Baron says: "I have no desire to die beautifully." <br><br>  For his part, Bezos expresses his faith in the mission of the newspaper, aimed at supporting democracy, if not in its potential to increase its wealth.  ‚ÄúI would not have bought the Washington Post if it was a financially unpromising salty snacks company,‚Äù he says.  Bezos recalls how at 10 he lay on the floor at his grandfather‚Äôs house and watched the Watergate Hearing on TV.  The Washington Post, of course, peaked at the time of its glory, highlighting that political scandal.  ‚ÄúWe need structures that have the resources, training, experience and expertise to find really worthwhile,‚Äù continues Bezos. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt is extremely important to know who we elect as president, and everything connected with this;  we must investigate those people, try to understand them better. ‚Äù(Bezos emphasizes that he does not intend to buy any other publications, although there are offers regularly received.) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/390/7a9/673/3907a9673994583e9344d4214c6bd8db.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Jeff Bezos, photographed at Amazon's Seattle main office, March 11, 2016.</i> <br><br>  The former owner of the Washington Post, Don Graham, whom Bezos had known for 15 years, came to him through an intermediary and said that Bezos could give the publication financial reliability and help thanks to his Internet experience.  ‚ÄúThis is the first company I entered, by and large, not from scratch,‚Äù says Bezos.  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt show any due diligence in legal terms - there were no negotiations with Don.  I simply agreed with the amount he offered. ‚Äù(Mr. Graham, who was publicly silent in the newspaper after the sale, refused to be interviewed.) <br><br>  By two parameters - the growth of Internet traffic and the number of new ideas - the Washington Post blossomed under Bezos.  (Bezos, not Amazon, owns the newspaper. The Washington Post does not publish its financial data, but we can confidently say that the newspaper is now losing money, given the investments it makes.) The number of monthly web site visitors jumped from 30.5 million in October 2013 to 73.4 million in February of this year, which was the result of the vigorous development of a new product. <br><br>  Bezos does not play any specific role in the current activities of the newspaper, but he closely follows it.  He communicates by phone once in two weeks with top managers of the news service, incl.  with Baron and publisher Fred Ryan (former president of Allbritton Communications), whom Bezos drew to replace Catherine Weimuth, Graham's niece.  Twice a year, the team arrives in Seattle, where during the day there are several meetings with Bezos, which are completed with dinner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c36/7f7/71d/c367f771d13f25b012bc48b95c52fe5e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  When he bought the newspaper, there was speculation that Bezos wanted to manage the editorial product.  Bezos says that he has no such interest, and Baron confirms that Bezos does not offer any of his own interpretation of the events.  However, the owner affects the solution of some specific problems, such as, for example, the duration of loading a web page and the ease of registration with a subscription;  Both examples relate to what Bezos likes to call ‚Äúconsumer obsession‚Äù questions, which are related to his experience of becoming an Amazon.  Shaylesh Prakash, director of technical development for the Washington Post, says Bezos is extremely ‚Äúpushy‚Äù in his field, and this statement may be considered a compliment. <br><br>  For example, Bezos pushed the Prakash team to develop Arc, a set of publishing tools, despite the fact that there were similar commercially available products.  Bezos told Prakash that Amazon, starting up, could get the software used at IBM ( <a href="http://fortune.com/fortune500/ibm-24/">IBM Œî 0.35%</a> ).  But instead, the company developed its own by creating a business that led to Amazon Web Services (AWS) - a fantastic financial success.  ‚ÄúHe thinks.  He's very good at thinking, ‚Äùsays Prakash, a former executive director for digital technology at Sears ( <a href="http://fortune.com/fortune500/sears-holdings-99/">SHLD ÔÉë 1.08%</a> ), which the newspaper took over even before it was acquired by Bezos.  ‚ÄúMy specialists and I get great pleasure from communication.  I guess Jeff, too. " <br><br>  Sometimes the creativity of Bezos captures him.  Prakash says that the owner has proposed a feature similar to the game that would allow the reader who does not want to indulge himself in paying for the article to remove vowels from it.  Bezos called this ‚Äúdiscarding,‚Äù and the concept was to enable another reader to pay and, thus, recover the missing letters.  The idea did not find a serious development, Prakash says, noting that "our hero was not very keen."  Bezos, an unrepentant believer in the power of brainstorming, says: "By communicating with other smart people in front of a blackboard, we can come up with a lot of very bad ideas." <br>  The newspaper‚Äôs employees seem to appreciate most what Bezos provides them with ‚Äúair cover‚Äù while they are trying to find ways to survive the transition from ‚Äútypography to digital‚Äù. <br><br>  Attracting new employees has grown significantly with Bezos, also providing more resources for serious journalism.  Ryan, the publisher, assigns responsible risk taking to Bezos - without fear that failure will be punished.  ‚ÄúIt gives rise to a feeling of confidence, especially when other publications are in the state of‚Äú If it doesn‚Äôt work, how will we pay for the next quarter? ‚Äù.‚Äù In other words, while Bezos enjoys, there is no longer ‚Äúdeadline for the next quarter‚Äù for the Washington Post ‚ÄúBut there are simply more opportunities to update journalism, preferably in a way that ultimately brings money. <br><br>  <i>To be continued.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299858/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299858/</a></p>
