A variety of the same "smart-hours" just rolls over.  European, American, Chinese manufacturers (oh, these Chinese) every week represent some kind of novelty.  Adults who are not strangers to technology and who have children sometimes think about purchasing a similar gadget for their child.  And not just for fun, not at all. <br><br>  The fact is that smart watches can be useful for children, providing them with multimedia features, educational programs and the ability to connect with parents.  The device helps the child get comfortable in the world of digital technology.  Parents also need these gadgets, since many smart children's watches work as a GPS tracker, which allows you to always be aware of where the child is now.  Plus, children's watches are often equipped with an alarm button that sends an SOS signal to pre-registered numbers and email addresses if the child is in trouble. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Elari Fixitime 2 </h3><br>  <i><b>Age group: from 4 to 12 years</b></i> 
      <br>

The set of functions can be called standard.  These are the SOS button, real-time tracking function and two-way voice communication.  There are several voice modules, including GPS / A-GPS / LBS / WiFi.  In addition, the developers have equipped the device with a 1-inch color touch screen and added multimedia features. <br><br>  The device is protected from dust and water according to the IPX5 standard, it is a very important factor for children's watches (if you know what we are talking about :)). <br><br>  The benefits of hours are not only the ability to contact parents or a color display.  There is a built-in alarm clock, speaker, microphone, accelerometer and pedometer.  So the child and his parents will always know how actively the child spent her day.  If desired, the child can send messages and emoji. <br><br>  The price of <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/elari-fixitime-2%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Ddeti_chasy">Elari Fixitime 2 is</a> less than the cost of an average smartphone hand.  And the probability that the child will lose the watch is much lower than the probability of losing the smartphone. <br><br><h3>  Tinitell watch </h3><br>  <i><b>Age group: from 5 and up</b></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/43e/22e/2e2/43e22e2e2180fff9da418ffd8d0f4ec8.jpg"><br><br>  But the main function of <a href="http://tinitell.com/">Tinitell Watch</a> is to provide communication between children and parents.  Among other functions of this device are voice calls via mobile communication.  When setting up the clock, parents set several basic numbers to which they can call.  In addition, adults can call from the smartphone to the clock if necessary. <br><br>  There is a GPS module here that allows parents to see where their child is, moreover, in real time. <br><br>  Listen and watch voice calls.  It‚Äôs enough for the child to say ‚Äúcall the mother‚Äù and the smart device will immediately start dialing the number. <br><br>  On the front panel of the device there is a button that allows you to turn off or turn on the clock.  There are two volume buttons with which you can increase or decrease the volume.  Tinitell Watch is IP57 protected, which means that they are not afraid of water or dust. <br><br>  Hours work about 7 days in standby mode or for an hour in talk mode. <br><br><h3>  Kigo Watch </h3><br>  <i><b>Age Group: All Ages</b></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e2/5c8/e7c/2e25c8e7c584fb95067d55ff27e8f15d.png"><br><br>  The developers claim that this watch is suitable for all age groups of children - from toddlers to teenagers.  The design of the device can be categorized as unisex, so Kigo Watch can be recommended to parents of both boys and girls. <br><br>  The gadget has GSM and GPS modules that allow adults to track the location of children in real time.  Coordinates are transmitted both outside the building (thanks to the GPS module) and inside (thanks to the GPS module).  The developers claim that the watch is equipped with a universal SIM-card, which can be used in any country. <br><br>  International communication is carried out through a partnership of watch manufacturers with the mobile operator Vodafone.  So, it will be possible to get information about the child‚Äôs whereabouts even if he is abroad (rest, training, etc.). <br><br>  Data from the Kigo Watch is transmitted to the mobile device (smartphone or tablet) of the parents.  The application is free, there is a version for both Android and iPhone. <br><br>  The watch is protected from water exposure according to the IPX8 standard, which means the possibility of "long-term immersion of the device under water."  That is, you can swim in the clock without removing them. <br><br>  Alarm mode is activated if the child holds the button for more than 3 seconds.  When this mode is activated, the watch sends a message to the entire list of predefined numbers.  There is also a watch removal detection system that will alert the child‚Äôs parents if the watch is no longer on the arm. <br><br><h3>  Alcatel OneTouch CareTime </h3><br>  <i><b>Age group: from 5 to 9 years</b></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a90/485/949/a90485949f063fe670834e3d1e4bf973.jpg"><br><br>  Alcatel has introduced its own smart watches for children, which can serve both as entertainment and as a means of communication.  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/alcatel-onetouch-caretime">Alcatel OneTouch CareTime is</a> equipped with a <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/alcatel-onetouch-caretime">panic</a> button that, when clicked, triggers a call or sending an SMS.  Also, the device is equipped with GPS and LBS-modules, so the gadget will show the child's location in real time. <br><br>  Watch can be used as a phone.  In the contact book there can be 5 numbers, so that the child with the help of a clock gets the opportunity to contact parents, friends or even a teacher (why not?).  In the clock settings, you can set certain limits, at the intersection of which the parents will receive a message that the child has gone further than necessary. <br><br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/alcatel-onetouch-caretime%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Ddeti_chasy">You</a> can buy <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/alcatel-onetouch-caretime%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Ddeti_chasy">Alcatel OneTouch CareTime</a> from us, however, so far only pre-order is available. <br><br><h3>  The LG KizON and GizmoPal 2 </h3><br>  <i><b>Age group: from 4 years old</b></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/638/21a/a37/63821aa37e677ff0a0d4b616206fa625.jpg"><br><br>  LG has long been producing smart watches, but for adults.  Not so long ago, the company decided to release a device for children.  And so The LG KizON appeared.  This watch is for kids, not for almost teenagers, so you should not expect too much from them. <br><br>  The main function of the device is communication.  So, The LG KizON has a GPS and Wi-Fi module, thanks to which you can track the location of your favorite offspring, as well as communicate with it at the right time.  Children can also contact their parents by pressing the button, which gives a voice call to the specified number. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/46b/dee/cd3/46bdeecd38dee083d55db14378421405.jpg"><br><br>  Another GizmoPal 2 model is a more advanced model, with a touch screen and more features.  There is also a voice call function, a GPS module, the ability to send messages and emoji. <br><br>  In addition, the developers took care of the availability of such fitness functions as a pedometer and a jump counter.  Parents can track the location of children in real time.  An excellent solution for those children who are still too early to buy a mobile phone, and communication is needed. <br><br><h3>  Caref GPS Phone Watch </h3><br>  <i><b>Age group: from 4 years old</b></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/646/9bf/01a/6469bf01a9260980a411c0d35c5957f4.png"><br><br>  This device can also serve as a reliable means of communication with the child.  At the clock, the operator's SIM card is already integrated with a certain tariff plan.  Parents can track the location of their children in real time. <br><br>  The watch is equipped with a 0.94 ‚Ä≥ OLED display. <br><br>  If there is such a need, you can call the clock in the "quiet call".  This will allow you to listen to what is happening around the child without answering the call.  As in a number of previous models, there is an opportunity to set a security zone.  When the child leaves the pre-set bounds, the watch will send the corresponding notification to the parent. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdJcrL4ckcY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  You <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/detskie-chasy-caref-gps-phone-watch/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Ddeti_chasy">can</a> buy <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/detskie-chasy-caref-gps-phone-watch/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Ddeti_chasy">Caref GPS Phone Watch</a> instead of a smartphone that your child risks losing.  The developers have provided several color options, including green, pink, yellow, blue, purple, black. <br><br><h3>  Hereo </h3><br>  <i><b>Age group: from 3 years</b></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2a0/aee/dc1/2a0aeedc1f68494e199a7b224df24ee7.jpg"><br><br>  The name of the model of this watch reflects their essence.  They are designed to enable parents to track the location of their children.  There are GPS and GSM modules here, so the location of the kids is displayed both by GPS coordinates and by the coordinates of cell towers. <br><br>  The clock has a built-in SIM-card.  Unfortunately, there is no possibility of making voice calls here, the GSM module serves only to track the child‚Äôs location. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.hereofamily.com/">HereO watch is</a> waterproof, so you can not be afraid that the child will drown them.  There is also a warning function to remove the clock, which is not in most other similar devices.  If the child wants to steal the clock from his hand, the device sends a message to his parents. <br><br><h3>  VTech Kidizoom DX </h3><br>  <i><b>Age group: from 4 to 9</b></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/359/1ad/6e9/3591ad6e99f60d3441b70f9b20d66b62.jpg"><br><br>  Vtech is probably the largest technology company specializing in the production of various devices for children.  These are not only interactive toys, but also tablets with smart watches.  One of the most advanced models of such watches is Vtech. <br><br>  Very young children should not buy such watches, they are unlikely to understand all the functions that may be useful to them.  As for the possibilities, they are quite extensive.  Among other characteristics of the watch is worth mentioning 1.4-inch touchscreen color display.  The company provides 20 different dials for lovers of customization.  There is no GPS, no two-way communication, it is rather a means of familiarizing children with wearable devices.  We gave the gadget as an example to show what else, besides the GPS watch, can offer the market of wearable devices to children and parents. <br><br>  For example, there is a camera with which you can record video or take photos.  Includes voice recorder and three educational games.  USB port provides the ability to transfer photos and videos to a computer.  Plus, the watch is not afraid of splashing water.  True, the company does not recommend going into a shower with them, but they are not afraid of rain for sure. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.vtechkids.com/product/detail/16653/Kidizoom_Smartwatch_DX___Royal_Blue">In the watch</a> there is also a calendar and a calculator, you can use games for fun. <br><br>  <b>So what for whom to take?</b>  As mentioned, there are quite a lot of smart watches on the market.  But their functions are more or less similar.  We would recommend to buy such gadgets for both very young children, and already for the slightly grown up ‚Äúflowers of life‚Äù.  The basic functions of the devices for the younger generation will allow parents to track the location of children.  More advanced watches for older guys can be used instead of a smartphone, which can be lost, with a wrist device with similar functions.  It will be much more difficult to lose him. <br><br><hr><br>  We remind you that for all our readers there is a promotional code GEEK, giving a 5 percent discount on any product from <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Ddeti_chasy">the Madrobots store</a> .
