Friends in social networks are live broadcasts from international airports.  In anticipation of night flights, they prepare pitches, presentations for conferences, business plans and articles.  The authors of posts on Facebook seem to be competing in the competition for those who are not sleeping: who has slept less today? <br><br>  Store shelves are dazzled with the backs of the books ‚ÄúHow successful people manage everything‚Äù, ‚ÄúEight rules of efficiency‚Äù, ‚ÄúProductive ninja‚Äù.  But among all this variety there is no really necessary book ‚ÄúHammer on everything and go to sleep!‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Studies prove: the lack of sleep symptoms similar to the state of intoxication.  Deviations of the psyche, depression, self-isolation and even hallucinations - the consequences do not frighten those who sleep in big cities.  ‚ÄúThree hours a day is enough!‚Äù They assure and drink the seventh cup of coffee.

      Just considered the creator of the Huffington post and the popularizer of sleep, Ariadne Huffington.  Once she found herself lying on the floor in a pool of blood: she fainted and broke her zygomatic bone after another physical (and nervous) exhaustion.  She understood: to live and work, you need to sleep.  Since then, she promotes healthy sleep, necessary for every person. <br><br>  While scientists are finding out how much sleep is optimal for the human body, we are talking about gadgets that focus on quality rather than quantity. <br><br><h2>  Neuroon Sleep Mask </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/27d/8a7/6b3/27d8a76b3c684736bd91089e726d2557.jpg"></div><br>  NeuroOn smart mask promises to improve the quality of even a four-hour sleep.  Comfortable design using soft viscoelastic foam adapts to your face shape, making it comfortable to sleep in any position. <br><br>  The gadget is equipped with numerous diodes and sensors.  Customizable modes will help you fall asleep faster, sleep better and wake up comfortably.  A nice bonus: the creators of the mask have provided the function of a short day sleep and a special mode for overcoming the jet lag. <br><br>  The device collects information about your sleep and transfers it to the smartphone (the branded application works on both Android and iOS) - in short, it creates all the conditions for you to take control of sleep. <br><br><h2>  Smart system for sleep withings aura </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a0d/bb9/bf2/a0dbb9bf254c4168b92059e060eab8b0.jpg"></div><br>  The creators of the system, the company Withings, calls its solution revolutionary.  A set of the gadget, which is placed on the bedside table, and a rug with sensors promises to adjust your daily rhythm and teach you to get enough sleep. <br><br>  The principle of operation is simple.  The rug reads movements and collects information about your sleep.  On the basis of the data obtained, the LED flashlight (also known as the music player, it‚Äôs an alarm clock) emits colored light, selected depending on the sleep phase, creates white noise and sets the alarm at the optimum moment. <br><br>  You can manage gadgets through a special application.  This is where you can choose the right scheme or even create your own program.  The data is automatically transferred to the cloud storage, which means you will not lose it. <br><br>  The device promises to speed up the process of falling asleep, to make your sleep strong and effective - is this not a miracle! <br><br><h2>  SleepPhones Wireless Breeze Sleep Headphones </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bde/917/8df/bde9178df6be4cf18915a7bc8b689f83.jpg"></div><br>  SleepPhones Wireless Breeze headphones are a comfortable sleeping armband, inside which are hidden wireless speakers.  The design promises not only convenience, but also safety: the shape of the headphones will help avoid injuries that can be obtained when sleeping in traditional headphones. <br><br>  The gadget connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth, a collection of sleep tracks is collected in its own mobile application: sea noise, rain sounds, relaxation music.  All this will separate you from the noise of the big city (or snoring of your neighbor) and help you sleep. <br><br><h2>  Alarm clock Medisana WL-450 </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d02/dde/787/d02dde787b1a4d4da948210b1f5cb0ab.jpg"></div><br>  Medisana WL-450 - an alarm clock that promises to brighten up your morning.  The creators of the device claim that the gadget will wake you up as gently as possible and make the wake-up comfortable even on the polar night. <br><br>  Several modes that mimic the sunrise, and 8 kinds of sounds of nature will try to facilitate the morning climb, even owls. <br><br><h2>  Smart Fitness Bracelets / Watches </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2d4/42c/565/2d442c5654d54a0da5b0d0167bdcd538.jpg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ad5/c6a/552/ad5c6a5524af4c6382d81053d277f326.jpg"></div><br>  Today, the market for fitness bracelets offers us a large selection of devices to monitor all possible vital signs.  Physical activity trackers, sensors for monitoring heart rate, posture trainers, calorie counters and drinking glasses of water, and, of course, smart alarm clocks that capture sleep phases. <br><br>  Models differ in price and functionality.  Some only count the number of steps and hours of sleep, while others report incoming messages and even pay at the checkout.  There is plenty to choose from! <br><br>  * * * <br><br>  The world of gadgets cares about your sleep and its quality.  But more useful than using devices for sleep can be the rejection of gadgets: smartphones, tablets and computers.  Do not be afraid to exchange instagram tape for an extra hour in bed.  Close the messenger, say goodbye to your facebook friends and enjoy your sleep! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370587/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370587/</a></p>
