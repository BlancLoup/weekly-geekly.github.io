  <section class="page js-page"><h1>‚ÄúGoogle. Breakthrough in the spirit of the times "- the book of the publishing house Eksmo</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Friday evening, passing through Tverskaya, I looked into the Moscow store.  Here in the section where they sell books called ‚ÄúBusiness as Zen, business as a way.  The lessons of the Japanese samurai ‚Äùand‚Äú Business in Jewish: 67 golden rules ‚Äù(this is not a joke, it really is sold there) and other waste paper of the class‚Äú How to make a million by doing speculation ‚Äù, I discovered the book by David Wise‚Äú Google.  A breakthrough in the spirit of the times ‚Äùby Eksmo.  Actually about this book and will be discussed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/19d/079/6fc/19d0796fc7a9dfa26e43747054f35b0f.jpg" width="300" height="269" alt="Google. Breakthrough in the spirit of the times" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why was the book exactly in this section?  Not very clear.  Moreover, the author himself writes the following: ‚ÄúI want to warn you: there is a large group of people who in no case should not read this book.  These are students and teachers of business schools.  Why, you ask?  Yes, because in almost every chapter there are examples of the overthrow of all the theories taught in these schools. ‚Äù <br><br>  And this is true.  The book is not about how to make money, but rather about how to realize their dreams.  In this case, the author all the time makes the difference between these two concepts.

      I have not finished reading the book to the end, but I can already tell you something about it. <br><br>  First of all, you need to get ready to endure a lot of laudatory paragraphs, and sometimes even pages addressed to Sergey Brin and Larry Page.  After that, the onslaught of the boast of Google itself will begin.  If this stream of sweet molasses does not discourage you, then in a couple of chapters you will get to the bottom. <br><br>  We have before us the history of creating a well-known search engine.  Literally from the birth of the main characters, until they translate the ideas of Google into reality.  The book is written in a rather lively language.  No wonder, considering that David Wise is a Pulitzer Prize winner and the Washington Post journalist.  The book uses materials from the editor of the same edition - Mark Malsid. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBreakthrough in the spirit of time‚Äù is not just a dry statement of facts.  Rather, the emotional story about the fate of Sergei and Larry, while still students of Stanford University, created one of the most successful IT companies on our planet.  A story about their families, which largely predetermined their careers, teachers and their first investors, about people who helped create Google not with money, but with their support and work.  And of course Stanford University, without which nothing would have happened at all. <br><br>  About Stanford, you can generally write a separate post.  The university supports any developments and undertakings (including financially), without pretending to the results.  This scientific institution has become the cradle of such large companies as SUN and Yahoo. <br><br>  And what, you ask, is the book outwardly?  For what they require as much as 361 rubles?  The book in the dust jacket, hardcover, volume 353 pages, quality paper, white (not newspaper, as in cheap editions), no illustrations, only a few pages of photos at the end.  In general, the layout is very simple, the font is fairly easy to read, but the headlines make us remember computer editions of the early 90s of the last century. <br><br>  So, if you ate a couple of dinners, you can easily save on this, I think, a very interesting publication.  At least I like it.  Very inspiring piece. <br><br>  Well, if the book is not to your liking, you can always buy ‚ÄúBusiness in a Jewish way‚Äù.  This edition costs only 79 rubles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6196/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6196/</a></p>
