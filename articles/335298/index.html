The market offers many different models, and each one has a certain set of characteristics. <br><br>  You can write code on almost any laptop.  However, your productivity will increase when you use the tool that best fits the type of tasks you perform.

      There are different types of development and for each of them there is a tool.  Thus, there is no one solution that fits all at the same time. <br><br>  When writing an article, I proceeded from the following: <br><br><ul><li>  You are a web developer. <br></li><li>  Your laptop is your main development tool. <br></li></ul><br>  Here are some considerations that may help you when buying a new laptop. <br><br>  <b>Transferred to <a href="https://alconost.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3Dlaptop-for-coding">Alconost</a></b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Mobility</b></font> </h3><br>  The laptop can be chosen in any shape and size.  Decide how easy and portable it should be. <br><br>  If you do not have to move often, then you should pay attention to the 15-inch laptops.  They have the best features and screen space, sufficient for multitasking. <br><br>  If you work in several places or travel a lot, 13- or 14-inch laptops are your choice.  They are lighter and the battery lasts longer. <br><br>  If you do not buy a two-in-one laptop, the touch screen does not justify the additional cost of it.  I would not recommend to buy a laptop with a touch screen. <br><br><img height="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fb7/066/b4e/fb7066b4ea454a14b81c7a5b5bb46abb.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Display</b></font> </h3><br>  The laptop display is one of its most important components, especially for programmers.  If you are developing, you spend a lot of time in front of the screen.  You need to pay attention to details. <br><br>  The screen resolution of most budget laptops is 1366 x 768, which in my opinion is a very mediocre resolution.  The screen space of such a display is not enough for multitasking.  Well, the text will not be clear enough to read. <br><br>  On the other hand, 4k display is too much, especially considering that its presence will significantly increase both the cost of the laptop and the battery consumption. <br><br>  In any case, do not buy a laptop with a resolution of less than Full HD 1920 x 1080 (1080p).  If you need a little extra for 1080p resolution - do it. <br><br>  Also make sure that the display has sufficient viewing angles, the screen should not function as a mirror! <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Processor (CPU)</b></font> </h3><br>  Laptop CPUs have a huge impact on your performance, so don‚Äôt try to save on it.  There are various types of processors with different characteristics that should be addressed.  The most significant characteristics are: cache size, number of cores, frequency, and TDP (heat sink requirements). <br><br>  In general, the processor Intel core i5 or i7 with a frequency of 3GHz and more suitable for most. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>RAM (RAM)</b></font> </h3><br>  I don't think you can seriously do laptop programming with RAM less than 4GB.  My recommendations for the minimum amount of RAM - 8GB.  And even this may not be enough with the advent of Electron applications that use a large amount of RAM.  If you can afford it, invest in 16GB of RAM. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Type and amount of memory</b></font> </h3><br>  Acquiring an SSD should practically become your number one priority.  This will give you a significant increase in performance compared to a standard hard drive.  Any operation will be performed much faster with SSD, including loading the operating system, compiling code, launching applications, loading projects. <br><br>  The recommended minimum SSD size is 256GB.  If you have enough money, then a 512GB or 1TB SSD is the best option.  If price matters, then purchase an SSD with a smaller volume that will contain your operating system, as well as your applications and the most frequently used documents (such as project files).  Everything else - for example, music and video - will be stored on a larger hard disk. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Keyboard</b></font> </h3><br><img height="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/654/3cc/44d/6543cc44d5704280a7166175d9f9d99c.jpeg"><br><br>  You cannot afford to sacrifice the quality of the keyboard, since it is on it that you will dial the code day and night.  I prefer laptops with a compact keyboard. <br><br>  It is very important to carefully test the keyboard before purchasing.  Make sure that the keys are conveniently located and convenient to press.  A backlit keyboard is a good thing if you often plan to work in dimly lit rooms. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Nutrition</b></font> </h3><br>  A good battery may not matter much to you if you are mostly close to a power outlet.  However, you should be interested in the battery life of 6 hours or more. <br><br>  Do not count on the battery life specified by the manufacturer.  Read descriptions on trustworthy websites, see what real users write on the forums and in the reviews. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>operating system</b></font> </h3><br>  The choice of operating system will largely determine what kind of laptop you purchase.  A number of options are available for Windows users, but if you prefer macOS, you are limited to one manufacturer. <br><br><img height="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/219/29c/3b6/21929c3b6b2f4be4a6588081fdc19eae.jpeg"><br><br>  Linux can be installed on most laptops, but it is better to purchase one that is officially supported by Linux.  Some vendors, such as Dell and <a href="https://system76.com/">System 76</a> , offer high-quality products with Linux pre-installed.  I recommend first of all to pay attention to these options. <br><br>  Otherwise, do your research to make sure that the laptop of your choice goes well with your preferred distribution of Linux. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Discrete or integrated video card?</b></font> </h3><br>  The presence of a discrete video card does not play a big role for writing code.  Buy a laptop with a built-in video card, and spend the money saved on an SSD or better processor. <br><br>  It is interesting to know which factors you consider most important when choosing a laptop for programming and how it affects your daily work.
