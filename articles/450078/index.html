      The American corporation hired Accenture's IT monster firm in August 2016 to fully update its look on the Internet.  The new site was supposed to earn in December 2017.  The deadlines were torn down, moved until January 2018, and then moved again until April 2018, which, as we were told, were again broken. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Hertz colleagues survived the delays, but ended up in a nightmare: the product and design, which clearly did not fulfill half of what was stated, and still were not finished.  ‚ÄúAt this point, Hertz was no longer sure that Accenture would be able to complete the project, and Hertz stopped working with Accenture,‚Äù the car rental company writes in a <a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2019/04/23/hertz-accenture-website.pdf">lawsuit [PDF]</a> against Accenture in New York court. <br><br>  Hertz is suing $ 32 million, which they paid Accenture as an advance payment to the current stage, and wants millions more to cover the cost of fixing the problems.  ‚ÄúAccenture has never provided a functional website or mobile app,‚Äù Hertz said. <br><br>  Accenture colleagues told El Reg on Tuesday (April 23) that they consider the Hertz lawsuit "unfounded." <br><br>  One of the most stunning statements in the Hertz complaint is that the result of Accenture‚Äôs work does not have a responsive design in which web pages change automatically according to the size of the visitor‚Äôs screen, whether they use a phone, tablet, desktop computer or laptop. <br><br>  This has been the standard practice of the website for many years and was even included in the signed contract, but Accenture staff decided that, according to Hertz, only desktop and mobile versions are needed.  When the executive directors of the rental giant asked where the tablet version was, Accenture "demanded hundreds of thousands of dollars in addition to developing the promised medium size." <br><br>  Further worse. <br><br>  One of the points of the task: was the formation of a common set of components, so that a company could exchange information and structures on websites and in applications of all its companies.  And Accenture, well, completely ignored it, according to Hertz. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAccenture deliberately ignored the expandability requirement and wrote the code so that it applied to the Hertz brand in North America and could not be used for the global brand Hertz or for the brands Dollar and Thrifty,‚Äù the lawsuit says. <br><br><h3>  Defective code </h3><br>  Moreover, Hertz believes that the quality of the code leaves much to be desired and a nightmare with security is not far off. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe Accenture developers wrote code for the e-commerce website, the client side, in a way that caused serious security vulnerabilities and performance problems,‚Äù the lawsuit said before noting that ‚Äúdefects in front-end development code were so common That all Accenture work on components should be written off.  "(Integrator used Angular 2.) <br><br>  The lawsuit claims that Accenture decided to use Adobe AEM analytics, but did not adhere to the architecture either in the code or in the file structure, ‚Äúwhich made the application unreliable and difficult to maintain, and also made future updates difficult and ineffective.‚Äù  We are told that the implemented Java code does not conform to the Java standard. <br><br>  And then the phenomenon of management consulting logic, Accenture, apparently told the customer that he wanted to use something called ‚ÄúRAPID‚Äù to speed up the performance of the site‚Äôs content management system ‚Äî and told Hertz that he would have to buy licenses.  Hertz bought the licenses, but it turned out that Accenture doesn't really know how to use the technology, and the quick fix took longer than without it. <br><br>  The lawsuit noted: ‚ÄúAs Accenture project managers recognized, Accenture" spent a lot of time struggling with the difficulties of integrating RAPID "into the Hertz environment." <br><br>  Colleagues from Accenture also failed to test the software, Hertz said, and when they did tests, "the tests were seriously inadequate, even to the point of misleading."  We were told that they did not test in the real world and did not handle errors.  Among other things, despite the fact that consultants were specifically asked to provide style guidelines in an interactive and updated format, rather than in PDF format, Accenture continued to provide guidance only in PDF format, Hertz complained. <br><br>  When Hertz ran into consultants about a PDF problem, guess what was the answer?  Yes, they wanted "hundreds of thousands of dollars extra" to cover the costs. <br><br><h3>  Everything is fixable ... for a fee </h3><br>  The team that worked on the project was dismissed, ‚Äúbut their replacements did not have the same level of experience, and much of the knowledge was lost during the transition,‚Äù writes Hertz. <br><br>  Despite the fact that they missed the deadline for five months without having ready-made components and the code burden with errors, Accenture told Hertz that to complete the project, an additional $ 10 million would be needed - in addition to the $ 32 million that had already been paid.  The lawsuit did not state what the reaction of Hertz managers to this particular requirement was, but we suspect that the reaction would contain profanity. <br><br>  An Accenture spokesperson told The Register: ‚ÄúWe believe the accusations in this lawsuit are unfounded, and we intend to defend our position.  Since this is a current legal issue, we refuse to comment further. ‚Äù <br><br>  Meanwhile, Hertz‚Äôs lawyers have asked for a jury trial, and the business wants to return all the tens of millions of dollars that it spent on ‚Äúinsufficient services and results‚Äù, as well as ‚Äúmillions of dollars in additional costs that were invested in correcting and completing the project ". <br><br>  And you thought you had a horrible story of website redesign ?! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450078/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450078/</a></p>
