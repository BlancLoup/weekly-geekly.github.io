I will say in advance - they are very logical, but they never worked for me. <br><br>  The idea is something like this: <br><br>  Price depends on your personal abmii <br>  You just do not work if the price tag is less, for example 2 thousand dollars.  Well, that is, this price tag is usually determined by authority, if you have a line - you drop a huge price and say that you don‚Äôt even take it less, let them look for students.  If they leave, convince yourself that they say, it's just not your customers. <br><br>  Price depends on the cost of the product. <br>  This is the minimum for the market, it is established so that, in principle, for work you can at least eat <br><br>  Price depends on customer status <br>  If it is a director of a holding of 5 corporations, the price starts to add zeros (on the right).  If this is Vasya's neighbor, the zeros are removed.  The question is whether you are ready to work in principle without zeros, and whether Vasya can give you something to replace these zeros for you.  We simply take the director of a corporation for the fact that he will EXACTLY give you nothing.  If the director of a corporation is your good friend, and you really believe (by the way, in vain) that he can be useful to you in life more than tac-toe, you can remove tac-toe for him. <br><br>  Some people have a very reasonable approach - they work for free, but they use connections instead of money.  Say wanted to eat?  There is a familiar cook, whom I helped in the 41st at the front.  Wanted a car?  There is a familiar autoinvestor who, for ridiculous money, will sell the car to you, because he owes you.  Do not forget one thing - you still need the money, so you will not work for everyone for free.  With all this, a friend will not give much.  Therefore, to be a friend and to think that you will have a lot of money will not work.  Money is earned from ___ friends, and respect from friends. <br><br>  The price depends on the emotional state of the client. <br>  A tired and joyful person more easily perceives the burden of life, and therefore a higher price.  If tired then ‚Äúwas not‚Äù, if very well, then ‚Äúis it so little?‚Äù.  Therefore, in business, by the way, it is not recommended to show emotions.  Not so simple.  Additionally, I will say that if you are aware of this, you will be able to turn on these states at the right moments and knock the solution in your favor by using them. <br><br>  Price depends on customer knowledge <br>  If you do something that he hasn‚Äôt even heard of, he will probably not give you any extra money.  But if you can tell him what benefits it brings and why you are doing it - the price rises.  But do not step on my personal rake.  You work for free and you drive what you are doing a very important thing.  Your client will smile and support you, but as you have worked for free, you will continue to work for free.  Nothing personal.  Business. <br><br>  The price depends on the level of your expertise, of course, in his eyes, and not ‚Äúin the whole village‚Äù <br>  If you have established yourself as a reliable person, in our world, where everyone wants to crush the other, you can, attention, try to crush the other and set the price higher. <br><br>  === <br>  The thing is: <br>  Pricing is a game of responsibility.  The client tries his best to keep the initiative in conversation and at the same time throw difficult questions to you.  They say you work, and say the price, while I want to earn everyone and do nothing.  And you try to knock the ground out from under his feet, take the initiative and prove that it costs so much, because he himself cannot do this without you.  While not offending him, not humiliating, and not being rude, that is, very polite. <br><br>  === <br>  That is, the order of the price is: <br>  - cost price <br>  - customer desire <br>  - your ambitions <br>  - trust level <br>  - client status <br><br>  If you walked through all the points and you agreed on a price, then you should already consider that you agreed and turn off any thoughts on price.  So you thought that you had enough?  Well, that's it, now do it. <br><br>  The usual situation in the world is an attempt to put the work below cost and in the end get a disgruntled client, but ... get it!  The client is not a curiosity.  The client is an ordinary man who is very rarely intelligent, more often he is with some kind of psychos, jokes and no money at all. <br><br>  You need a feeling of the time that you spent on your training and on what you help him.  If he comes to you and declares from the doorway ‚Äúand there the work is, ugh, move the column, that's why 10 dollars‚Äù ... <br><br>  Your answer is almost on the machine - "if ugh - so why did you come to me?" <br><br>  But again, for him, ugh, maybe $ 10, or maybe $ 2,000.  And for you, ugh, how much? <br><br>  Answer him "Take it yourself."  Aah, he is lazy and not enough time?  So it‚Äôs not ugh anymore, let's talk about the normal price - how much you don‚Äôt feel sorry for leaving you one day, not two or ten days for this job (or maybe 10 years). <br><br>  You know, usually, on this phrase, almost all clients tell you that you are a psychologist and where they fuck somewhere.  Well, what to do, you have revealed their insidious intent.  And customers with such a plan more than 90%. </blockquote><br><br> <a href="https://toster.ru/tag/%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581/interest_questions"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e38/2e4/b5c/e382e4b5cc1b4f91b269230d27bba0a6.png" align="right"></a> <h4>  Section <a href="https://toster.ru/tag/%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581/interest_questions">"Business"</a> </h4><br>  Interest Ask: <br><br>  - <a href="https://toster.ru/q/266427">‚ÄúHow to deploy Big Data in your business?‚Äù</a> <br><br>  <i>Hello!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Immediately, I apologize if someone misled my question, it‚Äôs just that maybe it‚Äôs not entirely correct, but I‚Äôll try to formulate what I want.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>As I understand it, Big Data is the collection of structured and unstructured data from various sources, their processing and analysis.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>How to organize it?</i>  <i>There is a task to constantly monitor a certain market (prices, taxes, cost of services - in a certain segment).</i>  <i>There are a huge number of sources of information, and manually it‚Äôs not really possible to cover it.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>As I understand it, there is a special equipment for storage and analysis, special software.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I also understand that I am far from all of this, since now the data are mainly collected by hand, but I understand that our business needs this technology.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Where to begin?</i>  <i>Who to contact?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Thank!</i> <blockquote>  Determine to begin with, you really have BIG Data or just Data. <br>  BIG is characterized by: <br>  1.
