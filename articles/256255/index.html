It seems that the guys from Google‚Äôs advertising department <s>together with the developers of their browser</s> (it turned out that the browser version doesn‚Äôt do that - if Adidas ads are loaded from the video, then scrolling takes place in any browser) ‚Äúslightly completely‚Äù was bold.  The situation is as follows: <br>  Sports website, Google ads inserted into one of the blocks. <br>  There, here, the video with the advertisement ADIDAS gets into it (they released a new video).  Just below is a screenshot of this filth, not the advertisement itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8c/c7d/f90/d8cc7df900b74a2ebfc47c98b83c258c.JPG"><br><br>  And all would be nothing, but about 15 seconds after displaying the page with embedded advertising - the page jumps so that right in the center there was an advertisement for Google. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the timeline there is a query of the following form:

This happens only in Google Chrome. <br>  I believed that this problem only on my computer (for example, in Opera, Explorer, this does not happen - it appears only in Google Chrome), however: <br><br>  1. A couple of days later the head of the portal rang and said that he had a similar situation. <br>  2. Checked on other machines with Google Chrome - the same effect. <br>  3. Removing the Google ad unit causes the ‚Äúeffect‚Äù to disappear. <br>  4. ‚ÄúHand survey‚Äù, as well as other automated methods did not show the presence of exploits on the page. <br><br>  Maybe I'm wildly stupid, but it is extremely likely that this is ‚Äúnew advertising methods‚Äù from Google. <br><br>  For an objective inspection of the situation I will give the address of the site in the spoiler <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Spoiler header</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="http://rusfootball.info/">rusfootball.info</a> - on any page <br></div></div><br><br>  1. I ask (just in case) to confirm in the comments the presence or absence of "effect" in Google Chrome.  Speech about the desktop version of the browser. <br>  2. In the adsense settings, banning this URL did not lead to anything. <br>  3. As reported by some of our users, there is no such thing in the mobile version of Chrome. <br>  4. Naturally, we wrote a request to Google on this issue.  The time, however, of their response is 48 hours. <br>  5. In principle, I saw a similar video on other sports sites, but now I can‚Äôt find them (maybe they just shot this ad unit?) <br><br>  UPD: In the ‚Äúincognito‚Äù modes, as well as during the ‚Äúunlocking‚Äù of similar effects, it is not observed  - in the sense that adidas advertising itself does not load. <br>  Some kind of nonsense ... Maybe this is "advertising personalization"? <br><br>  In principle, I am ready to give access to my working machine through ammyy admin for a competent specialist (I‚Äôll look at trite karma) through personal messages here.  Well, it can‚Äôt be that a number of people (the only thing in common is that everyone is actively interested in football, as well as letters to each other through the browser) - from different cities and suddenly they are sick of the same virus? <br><br>  Update2: gave remote access to my camelos <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/camelos/" class="user_link">laptop</a> - he also noticed this ‚Äúeffect‚Äù.  I think that the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/rpg/" class="user_link">RPG</a> can, according to the results, confirm that <s>I am not a complete idiot,</s> this effect is present, and it is associated with this ad by Adidas from Google. <br><br>  In general, it becomes clear that this is a specific feature of the block.  By the way, once a similar effect was obtained on Opera 28 (I do not have a huge personalization history in it, and therefore I had to refresh the page many times to ‚Äúwait‚Äù for this advertisement) <br><br>  PS Describing this situation, I perfectly understood what I could get ‚Äúaccording to turnips‚Äù - it does not interest me. <br><br>  This is not a site advertisement because: <br>  a) Not our audience at all <br>  b) The effect will be no more than one popular news published here.  Screenshot in confirmation: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de6/f57/5be/de6f575be35e438d876e0240e1d1d76e.JPG"><br><br>  And I will give an example of how we really attract the audience (an example of a peak, which really seriously <b>influenced something on one particular day</b> ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b82/c69/735/b82c697358a34d2f847b85b5b23e7c93.JPG"><br><br>  The question is that the incorrect system of embedding advertising on sites is used.  And this is done by Google and Adidas - we believe that people should know about it ... <br><br>  Update3: in order to completely remove the question of ‚Äúwebsite cheating‚Äù, ‚Äúthird-party scripts‚Äù and the like - I made a separate page on which there is a bit of text (like football), and there are no JS-ok and even a style sheet.  The only thing that is active there is an ad for Google.  And if it‚Äôs exactly the video from Adidas that‚Äôs being downloaded, you won‚Äôt believe it, but again it scrolls! <br><br>  <a href="http://rusfootball.info/check.html">rusfootball.info/check.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/256255/">https://habr.com/ru/post/256255/</a></p>
