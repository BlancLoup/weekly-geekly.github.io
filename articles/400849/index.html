The project itself has a wide network - open spaces are represented in cities such as Reutov, Krasnogorsk, Dubna, Dolgoprudny, Korolev, Odintsovo.  About the last in the list (but not the least) and will be discussed.  We will look at a few photos and take a look at what is the comfort of visitors. <br><br>  <b>Warning:</b> Under the cut about 5 MB images.

     <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/285004/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/878/eed/76f/878eed76f63d43598d7eeb1c8b2efee9.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>  <i>Photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/150684305%40N05/31383804154/">m1try</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC</a></i> <br><br>  Coworking "Start" in Odintsovo is located on the second floor of the business center "Alliance" on Molodezhnaya Street.  There, everything is as it should be - security at the entrance, several outlets and elevators.  Reaching the right place and opening the door with the inscription "Start", we get into the "workspace". <br><br>  Immediately at the entrance we were met by a comfortable leather sofa, a large sign with a coworking logo on one of the walls and an administrator girl, who is usually located behind the counter in the corner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f9a/692/8ee/f9a6928eea3041989edcf0b7a3ce5895.JPG"><br><br>  On the other wall of this small foyer there is a ‚Äútree-map‚Äù cut out of wood, on which are placed the logos of partner companies and co-working residents.  As for its functionality, there are hangers in the lobby where you can leave outerwear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/40b/6db/a0c/40b6dba0c044451c8b478754a201dba6.JPG"><br><br>  We go further and see that the whole space of the co-working is decorated very unusually - in a sporty style.  For example, red linoleum is laid on the floor, on which tracks are streaked like in a stadium, and running athletes are painted on the walls.  In general, the color scheme of co-working is very bright, so looking at it is difficult to stay out of tune. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18d/375/ca2/18d375ca2769403697054e26fafa37df.JPG"><br><br>  We pass further into the depth of the coworking and see a fork. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bff/845/688/bff8456888ac44ef95813a40946aa298.JPG"><br><br>  If you go to the left, then we get into the openspace zone.  Here are the boxes in which you can leave your things in storage, as well as a multifunction device for copying and printing documents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca9/451/501/ca9451501cc341a2834a5a5793e6b21f.JPG"><br><br>  Co-working space is quite spacious and is designed for about 30 people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ad/56b/cbd/0ad56bcbd7cd42bbb01297fe1e3b4e53.JPG"><br><br>  Light penetrates through the long window that occupies the entire left side.  Other walls cover or design installations, or graffiti, encouraging to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d20/8f0/a7a/d208f0a7a8d14628b8153927d5d6c4c6.JPG"><br><br>  It also has a ‚Äúbookshelf‚Äù with useful business literature.  Some of these books were donated by guests and coworking speakers - the range is perhaps not the most comprehensive, but nonetheless useful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ab/16c/3be/5ab16c3be2ba4c71b0b9f44b27bb2a14.JPG"><br><br>  In addition to the general working space, there are closed meeting rooms in the co-working room.  They are located behind closed multi-colored doors that you could see at the entrance.  Here, for example, a small but spacious ‚Äúnegotiation‚Äù for 6 people: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/283/f24/9e0/283f249e05924160b41bbcacf27b8398.JPG"><br><br>  But the premises for a few more employees: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb5/d2e/db9/cb5d2edb9c514c4ca8522c695ea42ae3.JPG"><br><br>  Also next to the openspace there is a corner for relaxation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/92c/802/579/92c80257943f40428431d2c0153f88a8.JPG"><br><br>  Comfortable sofa and soft armchairs-pears are available for communication and exchange of experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/503/88c/768/50388c76886e4652a0d17ae1d497bde8.JPG"><br><br>  In the recreation area there is a mini-gymnasium for pull-ups and a wall bars.  It costs a little away from the sofas so that you can warm up and not disturb anyone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae9/47d/d82/ae947dd82c944761adcb937932bae59e.JPG"><br><br>  In the business center itself, where the Start is located, there are several cafes where you can enter at lunchtime and have a good meal (considering that the price tags are quite acceptable there), however, there is also a place in the co-working space where you can have a bite, make coffee or just warm up pastries and chat with colleagues.  Refrigerator is also present. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0f/308/105/a0f3081055df4e9b97509e2eb4da5c51.JPG"><br><br>  If we go back to the very first fork and go straight through the large glass doors, we will get into a spacious conference room. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/122/a3e/299/122a3e299add43f49839e2e11983e796.JPG"><br><br>  In a kind of mini-lecture halls, all decorated in the same sporty style, meetings, workshops, trainings and meetings with experts are held regularly.  Interesting people and professionals from various fields are invited for a pleasant conversation, exchange of experience and joint tea drinking.  In addition, resident companies often use the conference room if they want to convey any new information to employees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f12/0f7/304/f120f73049854761a7566fe3e4dea393.JPG"><br><br>  On this, perhaps, everything.  In conclusion, I would like to note that coworking makes a rather pleasant impression.  If you already have a job, you still need to look at one of the seminars, and (why not?), Perhaps, spend a couple of your own (which we did this summer). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400849/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400849/</a></p>
