  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chronicles of repair or as IT-Schniki store opened: MadRobots goes offline</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The last few weeks have passed with a sense of wreckage.  No, it was not ‚ÄúA-A-A, chief, everything was lost‚Äù, it was a thoughtful and gradual postponement of the deadline for the final discovery, time after time, week after week.  I will not say that we were pursued by an evil fate, but we definitely overestimated our possibilities, and because of this, reality gave us a slap in the face for the slap, pushing the opening date further and further.  We were in the position of Zenonovskogo Achilles, who runs for a turtle, but can not catch up with her. <br>  Nevertheless, we nevertheless did it - <b>we opened the first MadRobots store offline</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d4a/8ad/720/d4a8ad720c67fb7d54a356e01bcb9831.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It all started, oddly enough, with the exhibition <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/madrobots/blog/212831/">3D Expo</a> .  A man came up to our stand, who introduced himself as the director of the top crust (it‚Äôs Gorbushk‚Äôs shopping center, not Gorbushkin Dvor, which are different buildings belonging to different owners), who said that we are very cool, we sell cool things, and he wants us in a buiding.  Yes, we wanted to open a store (for a start, a pickup point) in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe headcap - because our main warehouse is located nearby, but not so soon!  I had to change the plans and move the store from the date "somewhere late summer" to the date "right now-urgently."  It was quite adventurous, and made us abandon other projects, but the chance to miss was stupid - Tigran promised us any area, including the occupied one, but we had to decide now.  And we decided. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  March 12, Wednesday </h5><br>  A little less than a month later, we met with Tigran, walked for a long time in the shopping center, but still chose a room that was not occupied by anyone. <br><br><h5>  March 17, Monday </h5><br>  Within five days, we signed an agreement with Lebedev Studio, and they came to inspect the premises.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe store was to get away from the standard store look of the Euroset type - when the devices are in glass cabinets, and if you really need to see, the seller reluctantly and indignant that it is opened from sitting on a chair opens the showcase with a key, and giving you the device, vigilantly watching you - no matter how hard you put it in, or worse, scratch it.

      It should be a showroom in which you can touch every thing, try, smell, poke and hold in your hands. <br>  No cash registers, no supermarket aura - peak, peak, with-you-five-thousand-card-our-shop-is-next. <br><br><h5>  March 21, Friday </h5><br>  Three days later the first design was presented to us, we made a couple of amendments (they removed the aipads on the table and the wall, which were completely out of the budget), and the next day the design was ready: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13b/eed/78e/13beed78e91390a329751074305e0ff8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The design consisted of two parts - furniture (a long table in the center, and cupboard shelves on one side. Having a transparent side made of plexiglass on one side, they also act as a showcase): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f6/a17/94d/8f6a1794d6fc4bfae46f57e856b70e98.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And from the picture on the wall: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e4/2c0/39a/2e42c039add104e17d2eb9c52157dd3d.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  We order furniture </h4><br>  Ikeevskaya furniture cost 55k: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af3/943/2d8/af39432d89d1a569f97f0b80bd9e3ac9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Two racks of Assemblage in total with a discount of 78k: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/74e/9e4/a47/74e9e4a4787206cd3b1f4028df312c4f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  61k long wide table: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31f/dfb/816/31fdfb816a926f1990f4a6b64a70a012.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After that, the amount of 5k for the lamps did not impress at all: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/097/f9f/22d/097f9f22d0842f2bc29d30f56554a0cf.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <font color="#009edb">‚ñ∫</font> Current expenditures: 200k rubles <br><br><h4>  We begin repair </h4><br>  <font color="#aaa8a8"><b>Father bought his son Zhiguli, and the next day they broke down.</b></font> <font color="#aaa8a8"><b><br></b></font>  <font color="#aaa8a8"><b>They sit in the garage and consider instructions for repairing the car:</b></font> <font color="#aaa8a8"><b><br></b></font>  <font color="#aaa8a8"><b>- Here, son, now this is our Bible.</b></font> <font color="#aaa8a8"><b><br></b></font>  <font color="#aaa8a8"><b>- No Dad - this is our Kama Sutra!</b></font> <br><br><h5>  April 2, Wednesday.  Reconnaissance </h5><br>  In general, this is what happened.  When I arrived at the store for the first time, I did not anticipate that for the next month this place would acquire some ... sacred meaning for me.  Simply put, this whole month I will almost have to live in it, going home from there to sleep, and to the store to buy what I need to continue working.  Pavilion at that time looked like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f9/631/2e5/5f96312e53f0905412bc632e60a35a35.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first question was to the column, because it was covered with artistic slips (besides, it was a terribly curved, but then we did not notice): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f6e/563/397/f6e563397a20db94f7a9e1d757ccd2f6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And in order to draw a complex pattern on it, it had to be even and smooth. <br><br>  The second question - to the hatches with sockets in the floor.  According to the design plan, the floor is covered with gray laminate, and the gold hatches did not fit much.  According to the architect, they were like golden teeth in a white smile, absolutely out of place.  In addition, they did not have sockets, and some also bore traces of closure by someone strong, but not very clever: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/534/c3d/55b/534c3d55ba4489e6bf0504ed375814ca.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Yes, and their design did not provide for their use in closed form (ie, not ‚Äúopened the hatch, inserted the plug into the socket, pulled out the cable, closed the hatch‚Äù, but ‚Äúopened the hatch, inserted the plug and kept the hatch open all the time‚Äù).  In general, we decided not to collective farm, leaving them in the floor, and putting up with the cables that interfere with the walk, and move the outlet to the right place for us. <br><br>  Changing the floor to the laminate came at an opportune time - you could just cut the grooves in the tile, lay the wiring in them to the new sockets, and lay a new floor on top. <br><br>  We make the first, preliminary version of the list of affairs.  She looked like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dbb/559/438/dbb559438e1b2d956bb184f5a9647b02.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now, of course, a little funny - calculating the time, I forgot to multiply by the coefficient.  As it turned out, it is equal to about 10. <br><br><h5>  April 3-4, Thursday-Friday </h5><br>  Having estimated in the first approximation what you need to buy, I went to the building site.  Around the clock OBI - this is the best that is in their store, because more good can not be said either about the sellers or about the range.  However, everything was basic, and the first check was only 20k, including a thousand for delivery: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e75/35d/050/e7535d050e9d9a05c40d9746031224a0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another thing that hinders the perfect design is the wall socket: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9af/b3e/eb4/9afb3eeb4bfb7d29fb849548e07702be.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first version of the design provided that they will be closed by two ipads, on which advertising will run.  Then we still decided that removing the sockets would be a bit cheaper than two tablets. <br><br>  We unscrew the sockets, connect the wires with the terminals: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b86/c53/284/b86c532848228c0a32fa6a69ade2d7ce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And we close the hole in the wall with a very vulgar method - blowing building foam from a can: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55d/dd7/377/55ddd73770d588dc48c6d180be47ce22.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The desire to do everything thoroughly and for centuries protests against polyurethane foam, but in this case it is appropriate - it will act only as a temporary cushion for the mesh and shpakril.  Further loads on her will not, because after a few days this place will keep the putty itself, and the foam behind it can crack and become brittle as much as she wants. <br><br>  The wall, by the way, only in the photos looks white and <s>fluffy</s> clean, and in fact, it is covered with many months of dust, which will prevent the paint from lying down well.  And it is good if this will only result in the application of an additional layer, and not in the need for stripping and repainting.  Therefore, the wall is pre-primed with a special mixture that glues the dust and gives additional adhesion to the paint: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b44/f62/8de/b44f628de65fbe1b42ebcff9da50790f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  True, a good primer is sticky and fluid (bad - just fluid) and it is very difficult to tear off the tile after drying (this is the experience of the previous repair). <br><br>  But in this case it was not important - the floor could be dirty. <br><br>  Remove the hatches: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/856/c5c/fa9/856c5cfa9b0a708d8cf7bf553e296257.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We mark the floor under the shafts, taking into account the location of the table and new outlets: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/93e/70b/a88/93e70ba8888a58ff66ab1eec28e094d3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As I have already said, almost all the work took place only at night - at 21, the Hill was closed for visitors, and repairmen and builders came in collectively there.  Night ooze looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/34b/1a4/b1f/34b1a4b1ff510d42c1cf1e0a3605fadb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Pretty scary.  And the basement is like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26d/a98/9d3/26da989d3914ce9fccc8022d1380823c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the basement lying packaging from the refrigerant: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/308/884/4f2/3088844f2e8af185f2a1d60d48c9d66c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the pipes with valves mysteriously something gurgles: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b06/399/ae1/b06399ae19519336396be5ebcd5a97a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And behind the door "no one is allowed to enter" on the top floor: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/02b/8f0/084/02b8f0084cd9360ac43aea706e13683a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Hiding ... toilet! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8cb/e97/29f/8cbe9729f04e8b9e2382212b1ae0efaf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <font color="#009edb">‚ñ∫</font> Repair costs: 220k rubles <br><br><h5>  April 5-6, weekend </h5><br>  For the grooves need a wall chaser, and their prices start at 8 thousand and plus 2 thousand - discs for cutting. <br><br>  A wall chaser is such a closed grinder, on the shaft of which two disks are mounted at once.  Thus, he makes two parallel cuts at once (the distance between the discs is regulated by the installation of washers).  Well, another hole, to which you can connect a vacuum cleaner, so that the dust from the cut does not cover all surfaces within a radius of 100 meters.  Even in most wall chasers, it is possible to set the cutting depth: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e4d/2d0/b24/e4d2d0b245c44464af935fca263abaf9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, if you do not want to buy a wall chaser, take it for rent.  The decision was somewhat spontaneous, therefore, obeying the general spirit of insanity, I went to the industrial zone at 9 pm, and wandered there for almost 40 minutes before I found the right address in the dark. <br><br>  By the way, the wall chaser is quite heavy, bulky and hellishly uncomfortable in carrying - I was tortured to drag it to the nearest metro, although there was only about a kilometer.  Rent cost 1k rubles, and plus 2k - purchased discs.  By the way, nobody needs wheels? <br><br>  We connect the wall chaser to the outlet and vacuum cleaner ( <a href="http://instagram.com/p/lpzGuuMUyo/">like this</a> ) and start making channels for wiring: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/076/8aa/dd2/0768aadd2ca3bc8380f1b84c28cda477.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And then we go around the column and make a groundwork for the socket: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c23/753/dd7/c23753dd787903ed0260c0dd14f14c80.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I didn‚Äôt know if I would make sockets in the floor, or I would just pull the cable out of the floor so that the load could be connected to it with clips.  Sockets would be more convenient, but it is more convenient to do the cable, and it would be noticeable less.  The problem was that the floor of the tiled floor was quite hard, and at first glance it did not take a puncher with a spatula: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d6d/53e/c44/d6d53ec44f2774afaf1f4cbc79ed5c72.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now it was necessary to deal with the hole under the outlet and the column.  There were no problems with the hole: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/369/f05/b39/369f05b39ee38348f11153738887fe87.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But I had to tinker with the column: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc6/5af/4d5/dc65af4d5ae7340b673d9f1833c44154.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It took three 10-kilo bags of gypsum mix (it looked <a href="http://instagram.com/p/ma4I8xMU1d/">so</a> ) to bring the surface to a more or less plane: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/81c/d36/d96/81cd36d962ff95d46a14945d1e623992.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And then I made a mistake - relying on previous builders, I did not check the level of the column, but simply applied a more or less uniform layer over the entire surface, leaving it to dry for a couple of days. <br><br>  By the way, guess how many times in total the poor column was painted and puttied? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f9/441/878/9f9441878db61118835adc078a9c3280.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Pavilion at the end of the second working day looked like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07e/9b8/d39/07e9b8d394d2564d037ae139d8428d04.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the morning I wanted to check the lock on the back room door, after which I realized that it closes from the inside perfectly.  But it opens - not very.  More precisely does not open.  I sat in the back for 20 minutes before the janitor released me.  Scribbled on the wall a warning for future generations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e88/b31/aa2/e88b31aa2614902bbedd753b7dedff44.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second trip to the store for cable, sockets, under the ground, terminals, all sorts of spatulas, buckets - another 10k.

For example, the paint was not very opaque, and therefore it was impossible to apply a layer of light yellow over the blue layer (or rather, it would be possible, but this would require 4-6 layers, instead of 2 over white). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/02d/c52/1c5/02dc521c533fa352a7f7828ffa58d87f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And masking tape is a rather wide tape, and not a line with zero thickness - when you glue it, you can draw a picture from only one edge, and to draw from the other edge you have to wait for the previous paint to dry, peel the adhesive tape off, stick it over another one Scotch tape, and with a slight approach to the previous color, so that the strip of background does not come out between the layers. <br><br>  And the inclination of one degree by the pencil line is not noticeable, but over the course of a meter it already gives a noticeable discrepancy: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/603/bfc/054/603bfc054f3136bcbea1265db6ccbc4a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I had to drop the centimeter blue color: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d57/d77/c73/d57d77c734259ea485fec5fafc845be7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Having painted everything that was possible, we leave to dry for a couple of days. <br><br>  Another 4k for rollers, brushes, masking tape, film on the floor, and so on. <br><br>  <font color="#009edb">‚ñ∫</font> Repair costs: 257k rubles <br><br><h5>  April 16, Wednesday </h5><br>  Arriving on Wednesday, we notice with a fresh look the joint: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c54/2d5/406/c542d540607a71a7affb0c3c25e2d2eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And a crack in the wall at the site of the socket - due to the drying of a thick layer of plaster (it is finishing, and is not intended to be applied in a thick layer - for this there are gypsum mixes that give a little shrinkage). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c23/52a/15d/c2352a15d208a317975a7150900547df.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Paint over what's left: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e4/535/91c/8e453591c4eab050f698f9dd70e969dc.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Despite the brief description, it took almost all day. <br><br><h5>  Friday, April 18 </h5><br>  On Friday, installers from the <a href="http://www.antivor.ru/">Anti-Theft</a> Company <a href="http://www.antivor.ru/">arrived</a> .

Looks like <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/meklon/" class="user_link">meklon</a> got me hooked on Mikrotik. <br><br>  The router was needed not so much for the Internet as for video broadcasting.  What for?  In the first one, it‚Äôs very easy to have fun, like ‚Äúoh, look, we have a broadcast from our store‚Äù.  In the second place - for video fixing in case of any problems, such as a fight in the store (do not laugh, I indirectly participated in two such disassemblies, when the seller fought with the buyer) or theft.  Then we began to understand the beauty of the live broadcast - from ‚Äúsee who is in the store now‚Äù and ‚Äúfind out if the store was closed or not yet‚Äù to ‚Äúsee that the seller left to smoke and he was not there for an hour, to call and scold him‚Äù. <br><br>  Of course, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ivideon/blog/153301/">Ivideon was</a> chosen as a broadcast service.

Another thousand were thrown at the expense of Ivideon, and 200 rubles - an 8 gig card. <br><br>  Another trip to OBI cost another 5k - a couple more bags of the mixture and finishing putty. <br><br>  <font color="#009edb">‚ñ∫</font> Repair costs: 334k rubles <br><br><h5>  April 21, Monday </h5><br>  On Monday, the master arrived, who repaired the roller shutter (she has an engine inside a long shaft, cool): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b78/19b/7d3/b7819b7d369baf860128c3b4bdd5cf4d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Actually, they broke the metal fasteners, painted with white paint.

Who first responded and offered a normal price - so we conclude a contract. A person does not look at the legal address and bank in another city - you never know, maybe someone is more comfortable like that.

In the conversation, the name of the business center sounds, which does not really fit in with the one-story industrial zone in Chertanovo. It is here that a modern person begins to have suspicions, and he goes to the company's website to clarify the address. And he sees a registry at the beginning of the address: St. Petersburg.

With a dull mug we order delivery, having reconciled with another breakdown of terms. <br><br><h5>  April 26-27, weekend </h5><br>  Correct kosyachki on the wall: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0cf/d70/1fb/0cfd701fb4a0c7ca6bf7645070d33256.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Paint over the column and draw the picture on it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aca/3e7/5a8/aca3e75a868f0a7bba0475b7ad912095.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And we understand that the painting of the walls is, in general, finished: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/15c/82a/275/15c82a275c50b3346fc7d2c11b8064bc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Out of surprise, ofigevaem, and not finding anything that could be done in the rest of the day, my floor, we clean and leave home. <br><br>  By the way, the table dried up without stripes, but now it has become somehow knotty: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e67/eb7/74e/e67eb774e6a850c6df2293246f3cb14a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Paint 12k, painting walls - 15k.

My answer, that we, in fact, are waiting for the delivery, makes the manager no less joyful to announce that we do not have the ordered delivery, and our cargo is not entered on the route list.  This means that if there are empty cars, the goods will be brought to us tonight.  May be.  And maybe they will not bring it - as lucky.  We are full of plans to open once again today or tomorrow, therefore this state of affairs does not suit us at all.  Hardened by the blows of fate, we do not pay attention to such a trifle as the loss of the order for delivery, and decide to go ourselves.  Well, at least the warehouse will work all day, and you can easily pick up the cargo from it.  To our surprise, in just an hour and a half, we followed them and took him away without any fakaps or problems! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c3/f8f/479/2c3f8f479697700615492381be709b07.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We start in 6 hands to collect furniture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c7/414/54b/3c741454b256cea7ce34f2284f65163f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Placing it in strict accordance with the scheme: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/756/8d3/e22/7568d3e22c8314e20bfbec3f2afe528c.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  And nearby, hastily equipping a corner of a crazy painter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/046/d11/143/046d11143baa9c08916772b9df86bef2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In two hands we paint plastic: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a1/dc7/a62/7a1dc7a62861d244570dd2f81bdc6c0a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By evening, we understand that only part of the furniture has been assembled: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e3/c71/02b/2e3c7102b17e5eeb4d95655ed3ddd409.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And only one third of the plastic is painted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d4/a79/fff/0d4a79fffde256d970ce48c81b2418bd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Moreover, this third has not even dried.

That is how much is not the most difficult and not the coolest repair on a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe outlet. <br><br><h4>  What are we wrong? </h4><br>  First of all, in terms of timing.  None of us had any project experience even close to opening a store.  Putting a stand at the exhibition and hanging two TVs is not at all the same.  And the repair done at home is also a bad landmark.  At home you can live for months with a wall without wallpaper or paint, not really straining.  Price delay work in the store - the cost of the daily rental. <br><br><h5>  Murphy's Laws for Repair </h5><br>  You will break out of the appointed dates: <br>  If you do it the first time <br>  If you are not doing this for the tenth time <br>  If you can‚Äôt get to the job site from home in 10 minutes <br>  If only you have the keys in a single copy <br>  If the facility has a check mode or security system <br>  If you are not able to arrive at three o'clock in the morning urgently <br>  If you have kids or wife <br>  If within walking distance there is no profile shop <br>  If you do not have a car <br>  If you did not think in advance and did not make a list of all the necessary <br>  If the project involves subcontractors.  Especially if they are from other cities <br>  If you come up with a clever way to save time or money.  Especially if time and money. <br>  If part of the work requires approval or verification by the other party. <br>  If you put in the estimate exactly the required amount of materials. <br><br>  Our second mistake is the underestimation of value.  We were obsessed with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking the best store of cool gadgets in Moscow, and did not want to give up one iota (no, not the other one).  Because of this, and a serious disruption of time and spending over the original estimate.  If the floor is the best laminate, if the drawing on the column is on a perfectly flat, if the ornament is plastic, not painted.  And if they paint with paint, then with the best and the brightest.  If the furniture is not a table made of IKEA, but made to order. <br><br>  We spent almost half a million on repairs only, and greatly exceeded our estimate.  But on the other hand, we still plugged an internal perfectionist, and even he agreed that it was cool! <br><br>  The third mistake is the lack of personnel.  Such a serious project should be dealt with by an individual who, ideally, should conduct the whole project from the beginning to the end, and be aware of everything.  Universal people are great, but when they are urgently needed elsewhere, everything goes upside down.  In addition, side projects and activities that are paused, as less urgent, suffer. <br><br><h4>  Live broadcast from the store </h4><br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/">Here</a> you can watch the broadcast from the store in real time: <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/012/6ea/b5c/0126eab5c2b0856ca2add0a22e54896d.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h4>  Why should you go to our store? </h4><br>  There are several reasons for this: <br><ol><li>  We will be very pleased, because there are not very many people on the very top part. </li><li>  You can wave to the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/">camera</a> </li><li>  You will be able to look at the result of the repair with your own eyes - this is doubly interesting if you know how it was done. </li><li>  According to the code sentence ‚ÄúI am from a habr‚Äù we will give you a discount of 500 rubles for the purchase of 5k </li><li>  We have a whole range of online store that you can touch, touch, see and smell.
