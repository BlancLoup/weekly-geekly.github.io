Usually in such materials talk about job search and visa issues, but not much attention is paid to further integration, including in the work team. <br><br>  The Textly service team has published on its blog a <a href="https://textly.ai/blog/14-english-idioms-to-communicate-like-a-natural-in-the-workplace/">selection of English idioms</a> that are often used in office communications.  I decided to prepare a translation of this useful material. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  What is an idiom </h2><br>  In simple terms, an idiom is a compound expression, the meaning of which does not correspond to the original meaning of the words used in it.  For example, the phrase raining cats and dogs means a strong thunderstorm with thunder (dogs) and heavy rain (cats) - there is no connection with the original meaning of the words cat (cat) and dog (dog). <br><br>  Idioms do not belong to slang, since they must be understood by all native speakers, and not only by those who belong to a particular group (for example, IT specialists).  Therefore, many idioms are found in any area of ​​life - including in office communications.  And here are just some of them. <br><br><h2>  Office classics </h2><br><h3>  1) Get / Set the ball rolling </h3><br>  The phrase has penetrated into everyday communication from the world of sports, and is very fond of business representatives.  Now this phrase means the beginning of a business or project. <br><br><blockquote>  <u><b>Example of use</b></u> : “I need to make it clear.  Sally, if you can set on the subject. ” <br><br>  <u><b>Translation</b></u> : “So, I think now everything is clear to everyone.  Sally, take it upon yourself and send a letter to collect opinions on the subject. ” </blockquote><br><h3>  2) Take the bull by the horns </h3><br>  Again, there is no connection with the corrida, as it might seem.  This is the English analogue of the familiar expression “take the bull by the horns”, that is, to gain control over the situation through any decisive action. <br><br><blockquote>  <u><b>Example of use</b></u> : “If you’re a child of the new product?” <br><br>  <u><b>Translation</b></u> : “No one wanted to take responsibility for the bad results of a new product, until John took the bull by the horns.  He became the leader on the project and led the team to success. " </blockquote><br><h3>  3) Ahead of the curve </h3><br>  So they say, for example, about a company that sets the tone for its industry, it is more innovative and successful than its competitors.  Similarly, among the employees of companies there are leaders who can be described like this.  And if they say that about you, that is very good. <br><br><blockquote>  <u><b>Example of use</b></u> : “If you’re doing a lot of competition?” <br><br>  <u><b>Translation</b></u> : “You all did a great job this year, but due to the growing competition, we all need to become even more productive if we want to stay on top.” </blockquote><br><h2>  4) On the back burner </h2><br>  In business, an analogy with a juggler is often used, which needs to be simultaneously controlled with a multitude of balls.  Multi-tasking is an important quality in a modern office, but the ability to correctly prioritize is even more important.  And if some task turns out to be a priority, then other matters recede into the background - it is this moment that describes the idiom on the back burner. <br><br>  This expression originated in the kitchen - when the housewives could move dishes that are less important right now to the back of the stove, where the heat is less.  Because of this, what is most important is prepared faster. <br><br><blockquote>  <u><b>Example of use</b></u> : “Thanks for all your work.” <br><br>  <u><b>Translation</b></u> : “I am grateful for your work on the training program, but now we have to push this task into the background and concentrate on launching a new product.” </blockquote><br><h3>  5) Back to the drawing board </h3><br>  Sometimes ideas don't work, and you have to think about them again, that is, “return them to the drawing board.” <br><br><blockquote>  <u><b>Example of use</b></u> : “Unfortunately, it’s not a problem.” <br><br>  <u><b>Translation</b></u> : “Unfortunately, our new marketing campaign was not as successful as we had hoped, so we need to think about how to make it better.  Waiting for your ideas and suggestions by Monday. " </blockquote><br><h3>  6) Think outside the box </h3><br>  Perhaps one of the most famous idioms, which means the ability to think outside the box. <br><br><blockquote>  <u><b>Example of use</b></u> : “If you’re thinking about something truly memorable.” <br><br>  <u><b>Translation</b></u> : "Our new product should be special, so I would like you to maximize your creativity and come up with something truly memorable." </blockquote><br><h2>  Some more idioms to help create a good impression. </h2><br><h3>  7) On the same page </h3><br>  There is no connection with the books here, instead a general understanding of the situation is meant.  For example, the team of any project needs to “be on the same page” in order to act together. <br><br><blockquote>  <u><b>Usage example</b></u> : “we go forward.” <br><br>  <u><b>Translation</b></u> : “I hope after I explained everything, it will be easier for us to move on.” </blockquote><br><h3>  8) Up to speed </h3><br>  In business, no one wants to be left behind.  This idiom is often used in the discussion of various projects. <br><br><blockquote>  <u><b>Example of use</b></u> : “I’m going to bring you up to speed with all the most recent developments with the project.” <br><br>  <u><b>Translation</b></u> : "I need a report that will allow me to dive into the details of the project." </blockquote><br><h3>  9) Touch base </h3><br>  In American English, a huge number of idioms that were born on a baseball field.  And here is one of them.  At work, it is important to maintain relationships with colleagues and share information.  A proposal to organize a "base of contact" can be a substitute for an invitation to chat. <br><br><blockquote>  <u><b>Example of use</b></u> : “Let's touch me on with developments.” <br><br>  <u><b>Translation</b></u> : "Let's talk on Wednesday, and you can bring me up to date." <br></blockquote><br><h3>  10) Hit the nail on the head </h3><br>  To hammer a nail with a blow exactly on the head means to think of something, to hit the target.  The phrase is quite obvious, but at the same time bright, therefore it can sometimes be used in office dialogs. <br><br><blockquote>  <u><b>Example use</b></u> : “When you’ve said, <br><br>  <u><b>Translation</b></u> : “When you said that we needed to invest more in staff training, it was the perfect solution.” </blockquote><br><h3>  11) Too many irons in jail / juggling too many balls </h3><br>  For modern people, many idioms sound strange, because they were invented in those times when electricity was not used everywhere.  If you have too many “hot irons”, this means that you are involved in too many cases and you cannot do them all well (another analog is to juggle many balls). <br><br><blockquote>  <u><b>Example of use</b></u> : “You’ve got too many irons in the fire.  If you’ve had one, you’re not lost all of them! ” <br><br>  <u><b>Translation</b></u> : “It is easy to understand what the problem was: you were too sprayed.  If you concentrated on one or two important clients, you would not lose them! ” </blockquote><br><h3>  12) Not up my cup </h3><br>  Another pair of idioms that can replace each other.  The first is more often used in the USA, the second is more like the British.  Both of them are used to politely explain to the interlocutor that you do not want to do something, or something does not suit you. <br><br><blockquote>  <u><b>Usage example</b></u> : “I appreciate all your work but I’m not sure about it.  But I’m looking for what I’m looking for. ” <br><br>  <u><b>Translation</b></u> : “I appreciate all the work that you have done, but this is just not exactly what is needed.  Although if you tweak a few moments a bit, everything can be. " </blockquote><br><h3>  13) Cut to the chase </h3><br>  In Anglo-Saxon culture, politeness is very important, but sometimes you need to be able to clearly say what you need.  This idiom will help to get down to business - and it is actively used, including by the chiefs. <br><br><blockquote>  <u><b>Example of use</b></u> : “I’ve understood  What do you really want? ” <br><br>  <u><b>Translation</b></u> : “I understand everything you said, but maybe closer to the point?  What do you really want? ” </blockquote><br><h3>  14) Face the music </h3><br>  One of the idioms describing situations in which it is better not to be.  Despite the fact that at first glance, the phrase sounds nice, it describes not so comfortable things.  To face the music means to take the blame for some kind of failure, to which you could have, or could not even have a relationship. <br><br><blockquote>  <u><b>Usage example</b></u> : “I’m not close.” <br><br>  <u><b>Translation</b></u> : “I have a meeting with the boss on Friday.  I think I definitely fall for the deal that fell through. " </blockquote><br><hr><br><br>  And what useful idioms do you know?  Write in the comments - we will collect a complete and useful list. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435224/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435224/</a></p>
