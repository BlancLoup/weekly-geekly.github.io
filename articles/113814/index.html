The main selection criterion was the adequacy of the author.  There is a huge gap between the initial idea and the final product, and it depends on the author of the project whether he can overcome this gap.  Often, from weak or insane, at first glance, ideas, sensible projects grow, the main thing is to discern healthy grain in time and develop it in the right direction. <br>  The output turned <a href="http://moscow.startupweekend.org/organizers">39 projects</a> .  There is nothing unusual in such a sharp decrease in the number of participants: half of the projects do not live to see the final presentations.  The authors of the projects either go home, knowing that it is in the idea that they need to be changed, or they don‚Äôt find support and burning eyes from the experts and others and go on thinking. <br><br>  <b>After the final presentations to the four projects, Glavstart offered investments</b> : <a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  " <a href="https://docs.google.com/present/view%3Fid%3D0Acafl34_Ump-ZDk4OXZ3Ml8yNjlnbWhwNHJoaA%26hl%3Den">Choose a place for rest</a> " - a service that allows you to see in advance the chosen vacation spot the way it cannot be seen in advertising brochures </li><li>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/present/view%3Fid%3D0Acafl34_Ump-ZDk4OXZ3Ml8yMTVjY2ttenhnMw%26hl%3Den">CoSpace</a> is a service that allows you to safely hide your secret data </li><li>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/present/view%3Fid%3D0Acafl34_Ump-ZDk4OXZ3Ml8yODRkbjlnOTdnYw%26hl%3Den">IT RockOut</a> is a service that brings together developers and users from all over the world, allowing you to implement good solutions using crowdfunding </li><li>  " <a href="https://docs.google.com/present/view%3Fid%3D0Acafl34_Ump-ZDk4OXZ3Ml8yMDBoc3E5Yzljeg%26hl%3Den">Listen to the news</a> " - record podcasts to order </li></ol><br>  Arkady Moreynis, the leader of Glavstarta, commented: <i>‚ÄúIf they present me with sane business plans, I will invest my money in them.</i>  <i>But my task is not just to invest in 3-4 startups, but to establish a massive flow of projects.</i>  <i>I am building a Russian Y combinator</i> . <i>‚Äù</i> <br><br>  <b>Grants</b> <br>  On the Weekend, we announced the start of issuing grants jointly with Consultant Plus.

      <b>Web studios</b> <br>  Experiment with web studios can be considered as accomplished.  Half of the representatives of the studios "fell off" after Friday's presentations, before the Sunday meeting with the projects got 9 studios, including ADV.  After talking with the teams, the studios admitted that there were few interesting projects for cooperation - one or two.  Reason: Too raw ideas.  The studios admitted that they would decide to partner with a team that does not have a business plan or at least a clear understanding of the project - it is difficult.  We have taken note of this and will continue to cross web studios and projects without development forces in a different format, most likely already beyond the Weekend. <br><br>  Arkady also added that this year he is going to invest in another 10-15 projects: " <i>But our main goal is not quantity, but quality. It will be important to bring the already invested project to progressive stages. It is possible to attract private investors. It is important for us to get real ‚ÄúProject history‚Äù, to prove that we are really doing what we say. We will either prove the effectiveness of our model, or we will somehow reconsider and modernize it</i> ‚Äù. <br><br>  Our goal is clear.  It remains only to move forward, develop and not be afraid to experiment. <br><br>  <b>If you are interested in moving with us, and you</b> : <br><ul><li>  Expert with experience and understanding of the market, please contact us at expert@glavstart.ru </li><li>  businessman or private investor, we are waiting for you at investor@glavstart.ru </li><li>  the happy owner of the idea - the box idea@glavstart.ru for you. </li></ul><br>  In conclusion, I would like to say thanks to everyone who supports us and gives useful advice to those who scold us and make us think. <br>  Thank you Digital October Center - it seems Moscow Startup Weekend has finally found its home. <br><br>  And thanks to those who are not afraid to go ahead with us and make mistakes - because even mistakes, correctly understood and conscious, bring us closer to the goal much faster than safe trampling in one place. <br><br>  Your Glavstart. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113814/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113814/</a></p>
