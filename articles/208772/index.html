Traffic! <br><br>  Let's start with Stargate <br><br>  The whole family of the series, which began with the film of the same name. <br>  This is first, of course,

      <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118480/"><b>Stargate SG-1</b></a> <br>  10/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b17/04f/225/b1704f2258a1f517d60f212dfcc84679.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Led by the honored <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088559/">MacGyver</a> (actor Richard Dean Andersen), and now Colonel Jack O'Neill, a brave team explores other worlds (planets within our galaxy), getting there through the wormholes.  They use for this alien device called StarGate, found in Egypt during excavations in the early 20th century. <br>  I really like this series - and apparently many others, too, since it was already 10 seasons.  It is interesting to observe how the style of old fantastic Star Trek series in the first seasons gives way to a more modern one by the end of the series. <br>  His wild popularity has caused the emergence of as many as two branches. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374455/"><b>Stargate atlantis</b></a> <br>  8/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69d/f15/1a8/69df151a86db3e5902ceb3b50cad2906.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A group of scientists and the military (where without them) ‚Äúphoned‚Äù through the stargates to the neighboring galaxy and got into the futuristic city of Atlantis, built by some highly developed, but now disappeared race.  They also built the entire network of star gates, as it turned out. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1286039/"><b>Stargate universe</b></a> <br>  9/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4fb/5aa/640/4fb5aa640b3749575377bc0b41b02161.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Several scientists and the military happened to be captives of the ancient spacecraft (which, nevertheless, remains in working condition).  As it turned out, this is the ship of the very ancient race of forerunners who built the network of stargates.  The ship flies through the galaxy to an unknown, fascinating target.  Unfortunately, he did not reach the goal, as the television company closed the series.  But it was very interesting and very disappointing of such a sudden, timeless ending. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/"><b>Firefly</b></a> <br>  10/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df5/172/7e1/df51727e1509ae0eebcfc9e4ad0f1a4b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Perhaps one of the best nf-series.  The action takes place in a certain star system, where ships travel between planets.  Aliens are absent.  A dexterous and reckless synthesis of westerns and cosmic fiction from Jos Whedon.  As many know, the series also suddenly closed down.  This seems to be a trend. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/"><b>Black mirror</b></a> <br>  -/ten <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ef/0b2/59a/9ef0b259ae6da5e8c59c2afd86dc0516.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  British series, about what horrors advanced technology can bring to our lives.  In my opinion, watchable only by the British. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436992/"><b>Doctor Who</b></a> <br>  6/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6cf/64a/73b/6cf64a73b766bd7e589aab1c303cfc6c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The most long-running series, which can be attributed to the NF.  Although rather it is something like a fairy tale with a touch of fiction.  His new hypostasis has been going on to this day since 2005.  And there was still the original old version, which went from 1963 to 1989, terrible to imagine.  A very peculiar series reminds of the works of Douglas Adams.  Remarkable, for example, is that the change of actors playing the main character is spelled out in the plot.  In general, in a nutshell, the series is difficult to describe.  A representative of an extinct race moves on an amazing ship through space and time, and so that he is not bored in his adventures, takes with him some of the prettiest British actress. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2654580/"><b>Almost human</b></a> <br>  5/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4e4/587/df6/4e4587df6701c20bf38aec958055a6fa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the middle of the 21st century, technology has reached such a scale that the police have become incapable of coping with criminals, and only cyborgs help them in this.  In general, such a strange swing on the technological singularity.  I tried to look, but it became boring. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2070791/"><b>Revolution</b></a> <br>  7/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a2/300/e0e/7a2300e0e470a21310af5a4898cda831.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One terrible day in the whole world, electricity suddenly disappeared and all electrical appliances stopped working.  Cars, computers, airplanes.  Humanity rejected in the 19th century.  What awaits them?  Civil strife, famine, epidemics?  Why did electricity suddenly go out?  Who will the main blonde sleep with?  How is that, interestingly, the electricity disappeared, and the matter did not disintegrate and living beings continue to function? <br>  These and other burning questions unwind in the series.  People use cold and throwing weapons, play acoustic guitars and live without air conditioning and supermarkets. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2660734/"><b>Tomorrow People</b></a> <br>  4/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/552/3c0/669/5523c06694c82b5b8cb26cd92d96f41a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Youth tale about super-people with super-abilities (telekinesis, telepathy, teleportation).  It will probably be interesting for young people. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1183865/"><b>Alphas</b></a> <br>  6/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/843/ebe/68c/843ebe68c2422a8740920aacae2218ad.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Some people with inhuman abilities (good) catch others the same, but bad ones.  More or less watchable, but the series was suddenly canceled, and I join Sheldon‚Äôs indignation - how can we now find out why all of New York suddenly fell flat on the ground. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1462059/"><b>Falling skies</b></a> <br>  7/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/93e/464/d15/93e464d15002f85da10b1f70216fadc2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Alien invasion destroyed the Sunday plans of the inhabitants of the planet USA.  Almost all died, the rest are trying to lead the resistance to the invaders.  Pretty vigorous story.  In general, I do not like in the NF-series of aliens in rubber masks, but in this case they are quite organic.  The protagonist is a school teacher, re-qualified as the leader of the nobility, I mean the uprising.  Interestingly, the actor once played a militant archaeologist in a television movie inspired by Indiana Jones. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1954347/"><b>Continuum</b></a> <br>  4/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/668/04f/b7a/66804fb7ad24ded39e07c9b740a287c2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Canadians are good-natured and unhurried.  And they have the same series.  Although nf thriller.  A group of extremists from the future collects a time machine and falls into the past, and an operative from the future, a pretty lady, is tied behind them.  As a result, the group wants to change the future for its own benefit, and the young lady stops them.  In this case, not everything is so simple, because  the future is not at all cloudless, but from the point of view of at least this grouping, it is bent under the tyrannical oppression of megacorporations. <br>  True, after all, I fell asleep on one of the series and stopped watching. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132290/"><b>Warehouse 13</b></a> <br>  7/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/154/ea5/c13/154ea5c13189cfad58616b930366ccb0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Strictly speaking, this is no NF, but simply a fairy tale with a historical bias and a very nice steampunk-like entourage.  And very cute characters, for that she likes me.  The tale of artifacts - things that have acquired extraordinary properties due to the occupation of their former owners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf3/4d5/d4e/bf34d5d4e4db6c083c43db78c42cf97b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796264/"><b>Eureka</b></a> <br>  9/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e97/86c/7d7/e9786c7d7660c5735964f1d9fa0ce18a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A pseudoscientific fairy tale about the city, where geniuses from science were gathered together, and about what embarrassing things come out of it and how unexpectedly their experiments can end.  The main character is us marshal (I don‚Äôt know how to adequately translate this), who suddenly became the sheriff of this crazy city.  Actor Colin Ferguson with the eyes of a hurt doe. <br>  Fairy tale - but very sweet, positive and kind. <br>  What is interesting, because  This series and Warehouse 13 belong to the same television company, they are united in one fictional universe.  Guests from the city of Eureka came to the 13th warehouse, and guests from the warehouse came to the city.  It was fun. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839578/"><b>Person of Interest</b></a> <br>  9/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a9e/dea/812/a9edea812c0ae9a843c72b0402533516.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The series is often mentioned here, and although in itself it is mostly a fighter, it is based on one series-forming idea - the creation of artificial intelligence that watches people through surveillance cameras and draws conclusions based on patterns of their behavior.  Pretty perky series, still watching with pleasure.  The protagonist - a former tsrushnik, disappointed in government agencies, now works in private, helping one person at a time.  The charismatic actor played in another not very ordinary series, although not nf - The Prisoner, a mini-series about a man who is unknown as having fallen into some strange, closed, mysterious town. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0965394/"><b>Sanctuary</b></a> <br>  7/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/931/ce5/ab5/931ce5ab5a58876d3bfad9f2317e966c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Not at all, rather a scientific fantasy.  About Asylum for strange creatures that, it turns out, exist on our close planet.  In a nutshell, it is difficult to describe, and not everyone will like it.  In the role of the main brunette - the main blonde from Stargate SG-1.  One of the first, if not the first, series, where there are practically no decorations, and the whole environment is virtual.  It seems to me inspired by works of authors like Jules Verne and Conan Doyle. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1553656/"><b>Under the dome</b></a> <br>  6/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d5e/cad/d0f/d5ecadd0f52bb12bfd6d827cb5043746.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The series is based on S. King, but it is not very clear yet, this is mysticism or still nf.  (unlike the other series of King, Haven).  For the time being, it may well turn out to be nf, although script writers do not like this genre - after all, solid nf has certain rules, and mysticism is famous for the fact that anything can happen that is in the hands of lazy scriptwriters. <br>  I do not like King, but the series is watchable - mainly because of good actors and vivid characters. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407362/"><b>Battlestar Galactica</b></a> <br>  6/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bfb/a8d/a67/bfba8da676662ec5aa11da3bf90e9eb1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  (provocative poster, don't you find?) <br><br>  It all began as a solid cosmic nf, and ended with such (from my point of view) a dull burden that I barely watched. <br>  The plot is this - people have created intelligent robots, robots rebelled, then disappeared somewhere.  And then they returned, having greatly evolved, to which people were not ready.  As a result, of all mankind, only a handful of people remained in several spacecraft. <br>  A remake of the old series, from which Leonard has a uniform in his closet. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460651/"><b>Invasion</b></a> <br>  3/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9c/714/dc1/b9c714dc177bbd12f976944007b7b345.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The aliens slowly and slyly capture the world.  Inspired by the work of Heinlein's "Puppets".  Pretty sad, for which he was closed after the first season. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1119644/"><b>Fringe</b></a> <br>  6/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad2/777/e63/ad2777e63760c3d077eebca4233ed6d9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Successor to the X-Files.  Unusual incidents are investigated by a special department of state service, which is assisted by an old scientist, who, as it turns out in the course of the narration, apparently invented everything that was invented in the second half of the 20th century.  Only instead of the mysterious aliens from the X-Files here are mysterious bald people with unusual abilities. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135300/"><b>Dollhouse</b></a> <br>  7/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/deb/39a/340/deb39a340595dd71bcf1f52946c1475c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The creation of Firefly author Jos Whedon about a corporation that has achieved amazing success in accessing data in the human brain.  You can literally fold a backup to your hard drive, record a new identity, or even compose a personality from fragments. <br>  With all the absurdity of what is happening, you can take this game and enjoy the series.  In the main role - a pretty actress with a funny name Dushku. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808096/"><b>Primeval</b></a> <br>  3/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/513/d94/789/513d94789112a425940fdbc0083e4b6c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  British youth series about a brilliant scientist who suddenly opened portals to the past.  And from there flooded dinosaurs.  Not very interesting, and when the entire cast of actors gradually changed, it became generally bad. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441135/"><b>Flashforward</b></a> <br>  7/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd8/527/1d5/cd85271d504f8b7fad67297f9f736886.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The development of an entertaining idea.  Imagine that all of a sudden the whole planet fell asleep for a few minutes.  And during these minutes everyone saw an episode from their future (I don‚Äôt remember exactly, it seems about a year ahead).  Then everyone woke up. <br>  What was it?  How come?  Was it future or not?  Is it possible to change it?  And then it turned out that there was at least one person who was awake at the time ... <br>  An amusing series, I still do not understand why it was closed after the first season. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1582459/"><b>The event</b></a> <br>  6/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/014/4f3/a24/0144f3a24c7d8dba8cd3005860446110.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It all starts with the missing girl, and ends with a secret living on the planet of aliens who suffered a crash here.  And now they are planning to build something like a teleport in order to either go back, or seize the planet, or else that they have thought of.  So we do not know - the series covered up. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1641349/"><b>Terra nova</b></a> <br>  5/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4a/50f/d9d/b4a50fd9d7de1ac0f7ffed7e8de19a3a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With a show from producer Steven Spielberg, a fantastic series about how people, having dirtied the entire planet, unexpectedly discovered salvation - a portal to the past, more precisely to a parallel world very similar to our past about 85 million years ago.  And they began to move there.  Apparently, in order to dirtied the world early. <br>  Most of all, personally, I was impressed in the series by the physical form in which the actor Stephen Lang is in her for a minute, 60 years.  I want to look the same at 60. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa2/7a2/8bf/fa27a28bf25829a53405517945bd429f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1307824/"><b>V (Visitors)</b></a> <br>  1/10 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/693/c54/48c/693c5448ccfc38df42bd3cca2d7e6067.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Aliens have flown to Earth, and they seem to wish well for everyone.  But clearly not.  Not a very vivid series, but when I accidentally found out the main secret - that aliens flew in to kidnap - attention - water! .. I stopped laughing for a very long time and looked.  They flew to kidnap the most common substance in the universe.  Yep  And this is a remake of the old series. <br><br>  From close on the topic, but not quite fantastic, we can mention: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0805663/">Jericho</a> is just a post apocalypse.  Suddenly, the vigorous bombs exploded and what will happen now.  I watched with pleasure, but the show was covered up. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839683/">Awake</a> - the policeman was in trouble, his son died in a car accident, and they were left alone with his wife.  Trying to save the marriage, with varying success.  Another problem is that when a policeman falls asleep, he wakes up in a parallel world, where his wife died in a catastrophe, and he stayed with his son.  And both worlds are real to him.  And so the days alternate. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0801425/">Day Break</a> is a detective caught in Groundhog Day.  He wakes up, and the day begins with the fact that he is arrested, accused of murder, which he did not commit.  When he realizes that events repeat, he tries to whitewash himself, collects evidence and all that. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1333050/">Persons Unknown</a> - some strangers between each other wake up in a strange empty city, where they are constantly and everywhere watched by video cameras.  All this seems like some strange experiment.  I watched with average interest, but it was covered up. <br><br>  Favorite by many Star Trek, Babylon 5 and Lexx I did not master, it just so happened. <br><br>  In general, of course, television does not spoil fans with solid NF-TV shows, but if you haven‚Äôt watched anything before, and suddenly decided to do it, you will have some choice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/208772/">https://habr.com/ru/post/208772/</a></p>
