      To maximize the efficiency of the company, it is necessary to properly manage software and assets.  But before analyzing their work, it is necessary to understand what it is and make an idea about each of the programs. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Software Asset Management (SAM) </h3><br>  Software management is a set of proven IT practices that bring people, processes, and technologies together to manage and optimize software usage in an organization.  SAM can help you control costs, as well as manage business and legal risks, optimize software licensing investments and align IT investments with business needs. <br><br><img src="https://www.sysop.co.uk/userfiles/image/Logos/Software%20Asset%20Management.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  10 reasons why you should use SAM: <br><br><ul><li>  increase financial security; </li><li>  the best discounts on licenses from various companies; </li><li>  high level of security against license issues; </li><li>  good corporate governance; </li><li>  increase employee satisfaction; </li><li>  smoother operations; </li><li>  providing detailed information about unused software; </li><li>  increasing market position; </li><li>  increase in long-term business value; </li><li>  flexibility for the future. </li></ul><br><h3>  Hardware Asset Management (HAM) </h3><br>  Hardware management is the management of physical components (personal computers, laptops) and computer networks from the procurement stage to the moment they are written off.  HAM must be part of the organization‚Äôs overall business, and processes must be aligned with other IT processes to ensure that HAM is a key part of IT. <br><br>  Like software, hardware must be properly managed in order for an organization to make the most of this asset.  Processes must be created to manage the asset from the point of request, until the asset is removed. <br><br>  Effective hardware asset management can also affect the amount of time it takes to troubleshoot hardware problems. <br><br><h3>  HAM &amp; SAM </h3><br>  Hardware Asset Management (HAM) and Software Asset Management (SAM) go hand in hand.  The SAM project will not work efficiently or successfully without using HAM processes or any form of HAM management structure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nz/u9/in/nzu9in5ay2phw1-xvefu4p42rou.png"><br><br>  It is important to remember that in any projects related to new software, it is necessary to take into account hardware considerations.  This is especially true for any new software that is not on the list of approved programs.  Technical software or high-performance graphics software may require specialized hardware for correct and high-speed operation. <br><br><h3>  Top Software Management Solutions </h3><br>  <b>1. Build a solid foundation for your SAM program</b> <br><br>  SAM will not work well without a solid foundation.  Before you start optimizing software management, make sure you get full support from management.  Without good management, you will not have enough financial and human resources to carry out effective activities. <br><br>  Integral parts of the process will be: <br><br><ul><li>  cooperation with people in your organization who have technical, legal and managerial experience; </li><li>  setting goals for evaluating your results; </li><li>  definition of indicators, time frames and processes; </li><li>  choosing the right software asset management tool. </li></ul><br>  <b>2. Determine exactly which software you have and where they are located.</b> <br><br>  After all the preparatory processes are completed, a complete software analysis is necessary.  You need to know exactly which applications are running on your systems and which ones have the proper licenses and other relevant information about them. <br><br>  Since each company will have many applications that run on a diverse range of devices (servers, laptops, desktops, and even mobile devices), it will be extremely difficult to perform a manual analysis without errors.  You can save time and avoid mistakes by analyzing using an automated system (using a tool that scans the network) combined with a manual check (in cases where automatic scanning is not possible). <br><br>  The information that needs to be collected usually includes hardware configurations, disk usage, license type, contract terms, etc.  The software constantly receives patches and updates that need to be downloaded in a timely manner in order to avoid slowing down. <br><br>  <b>3. Monitoring software usage</b> <br><br>  Even after conducting a software research, it is impossible to obtain all the necessary information.  For more information, you must constantly monitor the use of software. <br><br>  Actual usage data can help determine which applications are used by the majority (or minority) of employees.  You can also use this data to discover applications that unnecessarily load the network (for example, not related to work streaming) or to control employees' workflow, limiting non-work related activities (for example, online games or visiting social networking sites). ). <br><br>  <b>4. Conformity assessment of software and hardware licenses of the company.</b> <br><br>  It is important to determine how the number of licenses relates to actual inventory and usage data.  If the number of licenses exceeds the number of devices, then this may mean that the company has acquired extra licenses that it does not need.  Less is also not good, as it may mean that some people in your organization use unlicensed software. <br><br>  The process of comparing and coordinating all these pieces of information can be very long if the data sources are located in different places.  Storing all the necessary information in a centralized database will greatly simplify the process. <br><br><h3>  Optimal hardware management solution </h3><br>  Even if an organization uses cloud storage, there is a high probability that the bulk of your IT infrastructure remains on company hardware.  This means that the management of the hardware is extremely necessary to be maintained at the same high level. <br><br>  Advanced hardware control methods (HAM) have similarities with SAM control methods.  But in any case, if you want to have sufficiently strong support at the development stage, the company needs approval from top management who can sponsor the HAM program. <br><br>  Of course, the company also needs to conduct an inventory of all the hardware.  It is necessary to record their physical location, specific configurations, related financial details, etc.  Since the hardware may undergo various changes in the process of use, it is necessary to include several processes in the HAM program, such as deployment, decommissioning and removal.  In order to optimize these processes, it is highly recommended to update as often as possible. <br><br>  Just like in SAM, hardware asset management can be more efficient if you use the right technology.  HAM, which scans your network for hardware and stores all relevant information in a central repository or asset database, can simplify many time-consuming and error-prone tasks. <br><br><h3>  Network Management Guidelines </h3><br>  The network is a key foundation that supports and connects all software and hardware assets.  Therefore, it is extremely important to manage them correctly.  Below are a few examples for this control. <br><br>  <b>1. Use network management solutions from suppliers that are not tied to a specific manufacturer.</b> <br><br>  At the moment it is almost impossible to find a corporate network, which consists of devices from one manufacturer.  Major manufacturers of network devices make their proposals to network management solutions. <br><br>  Since most networks have their own characteristics, it would be more practical and efficient to use a network management system that can support a wide variety of devices, regardless of their destination or manufacturer. <br>  Such a management system will increase the autonomy and flexibility of the network, and also simplify the situation from a managerial point of view, because there will be no need to study several management interfaces (one for each set of devices). <br><br>  <b>2. Take more active steps to troubleshoot.</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  Network administrators are able to detect errors by controlling certain values, such as: CPU utilization rates, network bandwidth, and network latency tracking.  By defining thresholds and creating alerts that notify administrators that these thresholds have been reached, efficiency can increase several times.  This will allow system administrators to take corrective action before something goes wrong. <br><br>  <b>3. The inclusion of virtual and cloud infrastructures in the system.</b> <br><br>  At the moment, most enterprises use cloud and virtual infrastructures.  Often there are additional difficulties in managing networks, as employees need to combine various infrastructures (cloud, virtual, and also physical). <br><br>  Therefore, it is imperative to choose tools that easily include virtual machines and cloud assets in their management, monitoring, and inventory modules.  Without this opportunity, the organization will not be able to analyze in detail its corporate network. <br><br><h3>  Financial benefits for the company </h3><br>  SAM, HAM and network management initiatives can offer tangible benefits to each company.  Having a deeper understanding of the technical equipment of the company, you can more consciously engage in the acquisition of additional equipment, which will minimize costs, avoid unnecessary purchases, and agree on better contracts. <br><br>  Thanks to the better visibility of hardware and software, you can easily optimize device performance, as well as ensure compliance with security, which ultimately avoids significant fines for violations.  Finally, you can increase productivity, because well-informed support staff will be able to quickly solve problems in various areas of the company. <br><br>  SAM processes must include HAM, and vice versa.  The operation of one of the products cannot be as efficient as possible without a second product.  Software has an impact on the hardware (this is a hardware specification that is powerful enough to run software).  The interoperability of the two solutions is the best way to effectively manage IT assets, while at the same time ensuring compliance with requirements for both hardware and software. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/359226/">https://habr.com/ru/post/359226/</a></p>
