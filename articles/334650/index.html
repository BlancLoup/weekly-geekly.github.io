  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The authenticity of your videos is now undeniable thanks to Prover.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today I will write about an interesting project of interesting people.  Ivan Pisarev and Ilya Svirin showed themselves in the <a href="http://nordavind.ru/node/90">Nordavind</a> project, independently developing hardware and software, very simple and very sophisticated solutions for various fields, from health to safety.  And recently, they had an idea ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ba4/ec7/a1f/ba4ec7a1fd7e483184fcd9edab54338f.PNG"><br><br>  Four billion people around the world own gadgets.  The video content they create has long ceased to be used only for entertainment purposes - today it is a necessary part of the media, financial, insurance, legal and medical industries.  Issued as a truth, ‚Äúfakes‚Äù more than once led to scandals, and even tragedies, so the need to confirm the authenticity of video files is unusually high.  The <a href="https://prover.io/">Prover</a> service, which confirms the authenticity of the video with reference to a specific time and device, was created for this very purpose. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The <b>Prover</b> technology ensures that the content was recorded at a specific time in a specific place by the camera of a particular device, and confirms that there are no signs of forgery and editing.  This became possible due to the use of two leading blockchain platforms at <b>once</b> : <b>Emercoin</b> and <b>Ethereum</b> .

      For verification of video materials, Prover offers two ways to verify video materials.  The first is the use of the <b>swype code</b> .  The user who turned on the camera of the smartphone sees the swype-code generated in the blockchain - a grid of 9 points, 3 in a row.  To enter it, the user needs to move the phone in space so that the virtual swype line follows the desired path.  After completion of the shooting, the hash of the received video file with all the data will be automatically saved in Prover. <br><br>  The second method, which does not require any additional user actions, is to record information from all sensors available in the mobile device: accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS, etc. The mathematical apparatus developed by the Prover team will be able to restore the movements of the mobile device in the smallest detail and match these movements with video content.  A mathematical model of such a device has already been created. <br><br>  What are the elements of Prover?  Firstly, Prover is a mobile application for smartphones that synchronizes with the work of a video camera and stores information in the <b>Emercoin</b> blockchain.  Secondly, it is a set of algorithms and utilities that implement them, which are necessary for integration with third-party services.  Thirdly, the smart contract Proof, implemented on the basis of the <b>Ethereum</b> platform. <br><br>  When using the Prover application, users will always have access to information stored on the blockchain, such as: <br><br><ul><li>  date and time of receiving individual swype-code; </li><li>  generated swype code; </li><li>  the hash of the video file (the video file itself is stored by the user); </li><li>  hash load date and time. </li></ul><br>  In the Emercoin blockchain, the swype code is generated based on the hash of the last block in the chain, the address of the blockchain network client and other necessary information.  After video recording is completed, the hash of the received video file is calculated.  The hash is stored in the Emercoin blockchain, along with the block number, on the basis of which the swype is formed, as well as the identifier of the mobile device that captured the video. <br><br>  <b>Where does all this come in handy?</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Car insurance (CASCO) - in case of an insured event, the client will be able to submit a video certified by the Prover system as evidence; </li><li>  Confirmation of authorship of the video - by recording the video, the user can permanently assign her authorship to her and be able to confirm it; </li><li>  Remote monitoring of patients - clinics and insurance companies will be able to confirm that the patient has received proper therapy in full.  The patient will be able to prove that he has properly fulfilled all the requirements of the doctors; </li><li>  Online games and quests - Prover technology is embedded in mobile applications, allowing you to record the occurrence of game events; </li><li>  Reports on the work done - remote inspection of the work (construction, installation, cleaning, patrolling, courier delivery, etc.) .; </li><li>  Fixing violations of traffic rules and public order - the time, date and place of recording the video certificate for submission to law enforcement agencies; </li><li>  Educational projects - remote identification of users and verification of their actions within the educational platform; </li><li>  Video messages of a legal nature - protection and confirmation of video messages without an in-person visit to officials. </li></ol><br>  Anyone will soon be able to invest in Prover technology: a crowdsale will be implemented within the framework of the Ethereum ecosystem.  Investors will be able to purchase Proof tokens at a fixed rate, obtaining the right to use the services of the service for free or with discounts, as well as apply for a portion of the funds accumulated by the Proof smart contract in proportion to the number of tokens in the total issue. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://prover.io/">Prover project website</a> <br>  I recommend to take a look. <cut></cut>  <a href="https://prover.io/assets/White_Paper.pdf%3F1">Whitepaper</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334650/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334650/</a></p>
