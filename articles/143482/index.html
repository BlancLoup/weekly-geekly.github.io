      For a proper understanding of the topic, it is necessary to make a small preface. <br>  The fact is that in the Russian Federation under the " <i>offshore</i> " is often understood the poor island natives, who for two dollars are naked photographed with visiting tourists, and for glass beads, the juice of an agave is stamped on palm leaves. <br>  This view was due to the fact that in many offshore zones the fees for registration and annual validation are less than the cost of a tourist trip to the same places, and the registration itself is supposedly not burdensome, allegedly does not require any materials and documents, and allegedly does not carries no consequences. <br>  However, this has nothing to do with the real state of affairs. <br>  Offshore zones are one of the main instruments of the global financial system, and there are far fewer such zones in the world than countries with nuclear weapons. <br>  (in fact, she is generally alone, but this is a separate conversation) <br>  The fact is that within the framework of Western public democracies, all state bodies and institutions are constantly under the sword of Damocles of possible lawsuits, parliamentary investigations and other similar troubles. <br>  But effective work often requires instruments that are formally unrelated to the state, not accountable to it, and not controlled by anyone. <br>  In addition to state bodies, there are other, and often much larger and more influential participants in the global financial system, with substantial capital, whose connection, and even more so, their dependence on a particular state, is rather relative. <br>  These are transnational companies, non-public banking associations, sovereign and resplendent royal houses and other " <i>oligarchs</i> ". <br>  They all need tools that are outside the framework of traditional state and even international control. <br>  It was for the " <i>basing</i> " of such forces, which were formally independent and not controlled by anyone, and international offshore zones were created. <br>  These zones are the main ‚Äú <i>hubs</i> ‚Äù of the world markets for currency, gold, oil, government treasury obligations, credit default swaps, secondary mortgages and reinsurance pools, large blocks of shares of the world's largest companies, commercial sea and passenger air fleets, etc.  etc. <br>  The total turnover of the Caribbean and Virgin offshore companies is much larger than the GDP of the United States, Europe and China combined. <br>  Only one turnover of dollar derivatives, most of which go through offshore, pulls more than a quadrillion dollars ($ 1,000,000,000,000,000). <br>  No natives, natives and glass beads there - no. <br>  Moreover, in order to curb the efforts of real natives and natives in their desire to make themselves ‚Äúthe same‚Äù - the International Anti-Money Laundering Group (FATF) was specially created, which quickly and painfully heals any attempts to even look in this direction. <br>  In a crisis, between shareholders - sometimes there are various discussions, and then events such as cancellation of anonymous accounts in Switzerland, the collective refusal of billionaires from US citizenship, or the move of Europe's largest bank to Hong Kong occur. <br>  But this is all - purely family disassembly (family - often in the literal sense). <br>  However, for a number of reasons, the procedure for entering and incorporating into these zones has been made open to any, even microscopic, third-party businesses. <br>  Why should the shareholders, at quadrillion revolutions, allow foreign users and collect ridiculous $ 500 registration fee from them - it‚Äôs a long conversation, for this presentation it‚Äôs enough to know that the ease of entry is deceptive and fraught with serious dangers, but with accurate and proper work, even small Russian IT businesses may well be a little nip off this holiday of life. <br>  It is only necessary to soberly and clearly understand the basic principles and not to make obvious mistakes. <br><br>  Error number 1 <br><br>  The most common mistake of Russian technology entrepreneurs starting to use offshore is ... using offshore. <br>  For external users, offshore is a complex, developed and as a result - not very cheap (if used correctly) tool of tax PLANNING and tax ADMINISTRATION. <br>  Accordingly, the need, relevance and feasibility of its use requires the presence of two components: <br>  1. Taxes are either already paid or they are supposed to be paid. <br>  2. Taxes paid, or supposed to pay MUCH <br>  If taxes are not supposed to be paid, a tool for planning and administering such a payment is at least not needed. <br>  If taxes are supposed to be paid, but these taxes will not be very much, the cost of using a complex and developed instrument will substantially exceed the savings from its use. <br>  The specificity of this error is that the offshore being pushed into the transaction is visible per kilometer, and the other side of the transaction immediately has a fair question why this offshore is needed there. <br>  In all developed countries, the issues of taxes and laundering of criminal funds are very serious and sensitive, and any unusual or absurdity greatly complicates the deal. <br>  When a small developer from the Russian Federation sells the utility to a US buyer for $ 10K, where the address often begins immediately with a two-letter state code, and the buyer sees the <i>Cyprus</i> contract and the account in the parex bank, it will immediately have a fair question what Cyprus is and who is a parex bank. <br>  If the transaction is voluminous, multi-way and requires advanced structuring and tax optimization, the parties can always calmly and jointly think about its implementation and without any offshore companies choose the most optimal schemes for all participants. <br>  Pushing off-shore-bought on all offshore cases - shows, first, disrespect for other parties to deals, and second, about the lack of understanding of the very meaning of offshore. <br><br>  Error number 2 <br><br>  The second mistake in relation to the first one is a mirror one, and consists of not using offshore areas where it can and moreover is needed. <br>  If an online toy is sold for $ 2, and most of the buyers pay for the purchase from their accounts in online payment systems, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to substitute your clear details and real data into the transaction. <br>  Especially if such a sale is not entirely clear, for example, from the point of view of copyright, guarantees, restrictions, prohibitions, or subsequent taxes. <br>  In this case, it is fully justified and even advisable to substitute for the transaction an anonymous dummy that was created or purchased offshore. <br><br>  Error number 3 <br><br>  This error is the reverse side of error No. 2. <br>  All offshore jurisdictions have agreements with all major countries on the exchange of information. <br>  All payment transactions of all payment systems, as well as most electronic communications, are always and unconditionally documented and stored indefinitely. <br>  In recent years, all previously disparate databases of disparate documents are combined into unified end-to-end accounting systems, and if an online email address was sold for $ 2, an email address was specified, which two years later was listed as a technical support address for the utility that was distributed from a specific The IP addresses, which after another two years were used to send an online payment through the bank-client system, with confirmation from the phone with the IMEI code, which is ......, all this data will be summarized linked together and to them - Sun will be added  other data, including social networks profiles, SMS, name, etc. <br>  And it‚Äôs not a fact that collecting all these data in one place, and even more so their correlation with each other (and this is done automatically) will bring great joy to the characters of the description. <br>  This error is bypassed by the old Soviet rule " <i>Worked - remove the workplace</i> ." <br>  Fortunately, the cost of the simplest phones, new sim-cards, Wi-Fi adapters, mailboxes, etc.  in comparison with possible troubles - they are simply ridiculous. <br>  There should be no fingerprints when using offshore. <br><br>  Error number 4 <br><br>  This error is a continuation of error No. 3, it closes up a short series of errors, and approaches error No. 1 on the other hand, and already at a higher level. <br>  Anonymous work with workaround for error number 3 is a short business. <br>  The entrepreneur does not pay any taxes and fees, but firstly, he takes a lot of risks. <br>  When buying a ‚Äú <i>ready-made</i> ‚Äù offshore, or offshore with personally unknown nominal operators-secretaries, and especially directors and shareholders, or offshore with bearer shares, his entire business can disappear instantly, therefore it is necessary to drain the cashier upon reaching the limit of $ 1K, which is far away not always convenient. <br>  It's not about the insidiousness of Caribbean or Virgin Islanders, but that with the slightest suspicion, or even just irritation, they can simply arrest the funds in their accounts, and kindly ask them to send an exhaustive confirmation of the legality of the funds and operations, that if they are anonymous or fashionable in Russia buying ready-made offshore " <i>turnkey</i> " will mean the loss of all funds. <br>  Moreover, despite all the ostentatious " <i>anonymity</i> ", for all offshore jurisdictions there is a " <i>long hand rule</i> " by which the authorities of any country can recognize any activity as organized specifically for tax cuts and recalculate taxes as they see fit. <br>  In addition, as stated in the introduction, offshores are made solely for servicing super-large and often anonymous operations in global financial, foreign exchange, derivative, oil, gold, etc.  markets. <br>  If a visitor arriving on the islands establishes a quiet banking, investment, insurance, holding, financial, shipping or aviation business, especially legal businesses, he is assisted, since all these businesses bring small, guaranteed, and most importantly calm profits to the islands. <br>  However, when dealers in socks from the Cherkizovsky market begin to abuse the kindness of their owners, and to drive thousands of $ 5 payments from stolen credit cards, the islanders' patience may come to an end, and they can ‚Äú <i>turn off the light</i> ‚Äù without any warning or even comment. <br>  This is not a joke, but a harsh reality. <br>  So firstly it is a risk. <br>  And secondly, without paying any taxes, the entrepreneur often deprives himself of quite interesting opportunities. <br>  As stated in the description of the error number 1, offshore, it is a developed tool for tax planning and tax administration. <br>  However, very often, with detailed planning of expenses and profits, it turns out that a clean and legal payment of completely non-burdensome (especially in the initial period of the business) payments allows you to receive " <i>much more valuable fur</i> " than saving penny (especially in the first year) taxes. <br>  This will make it possible to get closer to potential buyers as close as possible by opening an office in their state and city, and an account in their bank, which can greatly facilitate the conclusions of the first, most important transactions. <br>  All legal payments can be attributed to the costs of doing business, which will then allow you to receive numerous benefits and deductions. <br>  Phone bills, pizza checks, hotel bills, airline tickets, contracts, letters, faxes, DHL, FE receipts, souvenir pens, cigarette lighters, etc. can be used, which in the case of offshore will be impossible. <br>  By legal incorporation, the company immediately receives local status, and as a result, access to all municipal and federal tenders and orders, and to all support programs, of which there are many. <br>  The company immediately opens up ample opportunities for lending and attracting portfolio and venture capital investments, which is impossible in the case of offshore. <br>  The company immediately acquires the possibility of real estate transactions, which is either impossible for an offshore, or as difficult as possible. <br>  Naturally, with all loans, tenders, ventures and major deals, due diligence will be conducted, and all the dirty laundry described earlier in ‚Äú <i>Error No. 3</i> ‚Äù will pop up and crawl out. <br>  But if cleanliness and order in the workplace will be strictly observed, problems should not arise. <br>  In addition to material benefits, legal incorporation carries other possibilities. <br>  Let a very small, but working company immediately receive the possibility of visa support, which would otherwise cost much more, and a year after starting work, the owner of even a tiny business can initiate a permanent residence. <br>  The staff can be decorated in hundreds of different ways that are optimal for each specific situation. <br>  You can even try to get an SSN (Social Security Number), and practically free of charge to build up a medical insurance and a pension, which is much more real than from local Fursys. <br>  At the same time, the range of possibilities is infinitely wide. <br>  A foreign company can be a ‚Äúsingle‚Äù (by itself), it can be a subsidiary of a Russian one, it can be a parent for a Russian one, it can be a Russian representative office, or, on the contrary, a Russian one - a foreign representative office in the Russian Federation (it‚Äôs not a legal entity, it doesn‚Äôt pay profit tax and property tax). <br>  They may conduct joint activities with the division of profits and losses, etc. <br>  For IT business, in which dependence on material equipment and real estate is minimal, any structuring and administration of a business can be done completely legally. <br>  As a matter of fact, almost all well-known Russian IT companies work according to such schemes. <br>  And if with such structuring and administration it is advisable to use elements of one or another offshore regimes, these elements can and should be used. <br><br>  Offshore is a tool for tax planning and tax administration. <br>  If this tool is used for its intended purpose, then it works perfectly. <br><br>  =============================================== <br><br>  Previously: <br>  - " <i><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/143239/">Individualization errors</a></i> " <br>  - " <i><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/143290/">Disclosure Errors</a></i> " <br><br>  Further: <br>  - " <i>Mistakes of authorship</i> " <br>  - " <i>IP Security Error</i> " <br>  - " <i>Errors of budget money</i> " <br>  - " <i>Errors of double technologies</i> " <br>  - " <i>Toxic Investment Mistakes</i> " <br>  - " <i>License Errors</i> " <br>  - " <i>Positioning errors</i> " <br><br>  ========================================= <br><br>  <b>APDATE</b> <br><br>  Quite unexpectedly, the topic of offshore (in our opinion, for start-up companies is not so important) caused an increased interest, and a large number of questions. <br>  It became clear from them that the main message of the material was not as clear and clear as it was originally supposed. <br>  Let's try to clarify and clarify this topic. <br><br>  Rejection of the population and entrepreneurs of the Russian Federation from inadequate local authorities and from the exercise by these authorities of their power functions to collect taxes and distribute collected money leads to mass exodus to the shadow, cash and offshore (which is understandable and fair), but beyond that - to transfer such an attitude to completely other innocent countries and territories, which is wrong and unreasonable. <br><br>  In all generally accepted normal countries, taxes and fees are not a forced ‚Äú <i>tribute</i> ‚Äù to armed robbers, but market-based payment for services. <br>  With fair pay and the requirement of getting paid. <br>  And when a businessman from the Russian Federation chooses jurisdiction for his business according to the ‚Äú <i>cheaper</i> ‚Äù criterion, at best he gets exactly what he paid for. <br>  In the real world, " <i>freebies</i> " - and there can not be. <br>  A product with a guarantee costs more than a product without a guarantee, a product of a large and well-known brand costs more than a similar <i>noname</i> product, a product in a large shopping center costs more than exactly the same (?) Product with hands in a dark subway. <br>  Half of the global banking business, the entire global insurance business, and the entire market for credit default swaps are all about buying / selling guarantees. <br>  The basis of business is trust in a partner. <br>  The less trust - the worse the terms of the transaction. <br>  But in order to trust the partners with them, one should speak in a language they understand, and use generally accepted signs and symbols. <br><br>  The emergence of offshore in the ordinary business is - flashing light. <br>  This is a well-visible sign of " <i>attention</i> ." <br>  The sign itself is neither good nor bad, it is just a sign. <br>  The tragedy of many businessmen from the Russian Federation entering the foreign market is that they put it on, but at the same time they don‚Äôt see it and act as if it isn‚Äôt. <br>  This causes surprise and bewilderment among others. <br>  This is the main mistake. <br>  In itself, the use of offshore companies is neither a bad nor a bad thing, it‚Äôs just a tool, but in what hands it is, skilled or crooked, that‚Äôs another question. <br><br>  If from a site on an anonymous hosting, for $ 2 a broken software is sold, which legally costs $ 2,000, then the flashing light means " <i>all claims for quality - stick yourself in the train.</i> ..". <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This sign is well seen by all, and is well understood. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But this is no offshore, it‚Äôs just a cesspool, or even a cesspool, but in general it‚Äôs just an impersonal account on webmoney or paypel. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And in this case - there can be no checks, real cards, telephone numbers or fixed IP. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About the " </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">value</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> " of offshore. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The size of the registration fee and the annual fee are those things that should never be worried under any circumstances. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is like choosing a clinic by the fact that even or an odd number of steps has its entrance. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">99.9% of the cost of real offshore is the cost of the local staff + rent.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only two numbers matter - the total cost of ownership of the company, and the cumulative benefit of running a particular type of business with specific partners through the company. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since the network is one, there are no miracles in it, what are the fees, so is the service. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About the size of the " </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">taxes</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ". </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He does not matter. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If in abstract Singapore 5%, and in no less abstract Hong Kong 15%, then this does not mean anything. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If 5 were definitely less than 15, everyone would have moved from Hong Kong to Singapore in a month, and the question would have been closed. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, if such figures have been at least five years past, and no one even moved, then it‚Äôs not about them.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AvtoVAZ - is much cheaper than a Mercedes, well, so they are different, so they stand in different ways. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only two numbers matter - the total cost of ownership of the company, and the cumulative benefit of running a particular type of business with specific partners through the company. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All the rest is the wiring of merchants offshore (which, by the way, have nothing to do with the zones themselves). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now directly from the initial post. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It goes within the framework of the series ‚Äú </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Transfer Errors</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ‚Äù, and for this reason considers all phenomena (in this case, offshore companies) in the context of the positive / negative impact on this transfer. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We do this, we look only from this point of view, and pay attention only to errors and jambs in our direction.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If real estate professionals write on this topic, they will write from a different, probably different, position and practice. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If they write people involved in divorce and division of inheritance - the third. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Those who work on the line of emigration - with the fourth. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Those who take out people for treatment - from the fifth.</font></font><br>  Etc. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And from the point of view of output of developments and businesses to the world market, this topic is clear and transparent. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To test the market and demand, and to collect $ 2 from the nose, anonymous, strictly anonymous garbage dumps, which then have to disappear without a trace, are quite acceptable. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And when it has already been decided to move forward, it is necessary to build clean and fluffy companies from scratch, and to build as close as possible to the first, most valuable clients, so that they simply cannot have any unnecessary questions. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When a building is being built, large concrete blocks or one monolithic slab should be laid in its foundation, then the stability of the structure is guaranteed. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If, as a foundation, bales of straw are being wrapped around - no need to be surprised when everything starts to falter and fall.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything that concerns taxes, and especially offshore companies, should be dealt with by the financial director of an already operating company, and even better, by its auditors. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Any other " </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">entry</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> " in this topic is an error that costs certain expenses and losses. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Legal incorporation of a small IT-company in the same US -
