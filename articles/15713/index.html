  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DrugMe and I Love Cinema: what happened to high expectations of the Runet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the beginning of this year, two resources were launched in Runet that are very promising in their idea and ambitious plans to capture the audience: the medical social network <a href="http://www.drugme.ru/mainpage">DrugMe</a> and the network of cinema fans <a href="http://ilovecinema.ru/">I love cinema</a> .  At the time of their youth, habraradaciya interviewed their creators - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/kronberg/" class="user_link">kronberg</a> Evgenia Kronberg ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/community_life/11813.html">DrugMe</a> ) and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/yagr/" class="user_link">yagr</a> Yaroslav Greshilov ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/5119.html">ilovecinema</a> ).  A lively discussion of the prospects for these projects then resulted in dozens of comments, in which both pessimistic and optimistic forecasts were expressed.  Why today were the first realistic and what we can see in the future, I again talked with our heroes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Despite the seemingly huge difference between these two projects, they faced similar problems in their development.  The first, and most important of them, is the lack of experience in creating similar sites in Russia, and the almost complete inapplicability of Western models to our reality.  It is not enough to make a collective blog about health or cinema, it is not enough to fasten a rating of films or medical institutions to it.  "Because to take and transfer the interaction of people within an area on the Internet is a task much more difficult," says Yaroslav Greshilov and adds that "Habr, by the way, also failed to cope with this, from my point of view, and became just collective media it-topics.  There are only any echoes of this attempt in the form of company pages, for example. ‚Äù <br><br>  Without trying to derive a universal formula for a successful social project on the Internet in this article, let's see what their creators themselves say about their offspring.  Evgenia Kronberg says that the project has enough resources (I remind you that it is being driven by an <a href="http://www.e-generator.ru/">e-generator</a> ) and now it is actively working on a new version of it, taking into account past mistakes.  In particular, now the site clearly lacks the tools of socialization: the system of invites, the separation of users into communities of interest, and others.  Some ideas are adapted from the experience of Western colleagues, for example, <a href="http://imedix.com/">iMedix.com</a> , there is cooperation with specialized sites in Runet, for example, with <a href="http://medlux.ru/">MedLux.ru</a> , which gave its search for drugs at pharmacies.  There is also contact with a number of hospitals and clinics that have offices on the Web and are interested in attracting visitors to them.  In general, contacts with the real medical and near-medical sphere (hospitals, doctors, medical insurance, creditor banks, pharmacy chains) are priorities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/5ff/08e/f95/5ff08ef95bb90dcef4df8e29ba3c5e13.jpg" vspace="10" align="left">  The potential audience of the project, according to Eugenia, is 10 million people, ‚Äúbecause everyone wants to be healthy‚Äù.  Today, the site <a href="http://top100.rambler.ru/cgi-bin/stats_top100.cgi%3Fid%3D1205877%26page%3D1">gives</a> about 4,000 page views per day.  Perhaps this is because the Internet is not yet considered by most as a trustworthy source of information about medicine.  But it is also obvious that DrugMe has so far done too little for trust to appear.  Blaming him for this is difficult, compared with such monsters as Microsoft's <a href="http://www.healthvault.com/">Health Vault</a> , which puts the interaction of medicine and the Network to a new level - incorrectly, since it is based on many years of work with a much more orderly than ours, the US medical field.  It remains only to wish the DrugMe team not to stop at what has been achieved and to work hard to turn their website into an influential force, and not just an observer.

      Yaroslav says that today ilovecinema is only 40% ready.  ‚ÄúThis is not connected with surprises, but with the speed of project development.  At the start, we incorrectly estimated the scale of the necessary development and our possible pace. ‚ÄùFurther plans are connected with the restructuring of the project, the appearance of its own design and, probably, a change of ownership.  Therefore, negotiations are under way with several companies that are interested either in thematic social projects or on the cinema website.  Currently, the development is carried out by the <a href="http://www.expert.ru/">Expert‚Äôs</a> technical department, the priority for which is the core Internet projects of the Group.  ‚ÄúPlus, we need significantly more resources than we initially expected, and now it‚Äôs no longer possible to increase them in the current situation,‚Äù he adds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/687/49d/dee/68749ddeed30b1b1aec4b9edc506ab45.gif" width="215" height="59" hspace="10" align="right">  ‚Äú‚Äú Expert ‚Äùis primarily journalists, some of the best journalists in the country.  An attempt to implement a project unrelated to journalism within the framework of ‚ÄúExpert‚Äù, and from the point of view of normal media, it was not at all clear what was originally an adventure.  ‚ÄúExpert‚Äù gave us the opportunity to start such a project, for which he thanks a lot, but now it is obvious to us and them that he is ‚Äúpast‚Äù the main activity of the holding, and his vast experience cannot help us in this project. ‚Äù <br><br>  However, a balanced and creative approach of the development team to the project is visible even at the current stage of its development, and the site is simply a pleasure to be.  I would like to wish him only good luck and striving for the top, since the need for an objective leader, authority among the movie sites of Runet is long overdue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15713/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15713/</a></p>
