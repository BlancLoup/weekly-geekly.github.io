Which of today's schoolchildren and students will become an astronaut, engineer, or scientist?  For this to be possible, now there must be one adult who will teach and inspire children.  And there are such people.  Just the other day, the Ufa Space School returned from an excursion to Baikonur, which was organized by the Baikonur Lyceum "International Space School.  VN Chelomey.  I bring to your attention the interview report of the head of the Ufa Cosmos School, Alexey Allikas, on this trip. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Little about school </h4><br>  I have already <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/240672/">told you</a> about the Ufa space school ‚ÄúThe Big Space Journey‚Äù on the basis of the ‚ÄúRosstan‚Äù club.  The school is actively working, for example, last year, the senior crew virtually <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/245144/">flew to the moon</a> in preparation for the Martian virtual flight. <br><br><h4>  Interview Report </h4><br>  <b>Alexey, what was the name of the event, who organized it?</b> <br>  Information about this tour came through the planetariums.  From <a href="http://ufaplanetarium.ru/">our planetarium to</a> us.  For the workers of the Russian planetariums, the Baikonur Lyceum ‚ÄúThe International Space School.  VNChelomeya "offered this tour at the lowest prices.  I requested permission to come with children.  I did not refuse.  There was a couple of children with their parents.  Formally, this was called the "Scientific Conference" Astronomy and Cosmonautics at School "."  Passed from 16 to 20 March. <br><br>  <b>And what is this lyceum?</b> <br>  MKSH makes such excursions for a long time.  They all worked out.  Hostel with meals.  Contacts in the city and at the spaceport.  They know.  They are trusted.  Under this program, former landfill workers are involved with adults and children.  The school itself is the highest level.  Dmitry Shatalov (director) raised and held her.  Strict selection, exams - twice a year, world-class competitions in rocket modeling, a museum of space technology at school (okay, layouts, fragments of 1-2 steps from the fields of fall, but V-2 engine, descent module TKS!).  Their students grab any universities.  70% go to work in the space program.  And I did not hear from them.

      <b>What part of you went?</b> <br>  I drove for the first time to scout.  Therefore, I decided to take only 3-4 older ones.  But spring financial avitaminosis ... I had to close the hole in the compartment by the commander of the younger crew.  All - the winners of the republican and All-Russian competitions.  Elder you saw on a moonlight flight.  All have experience of long journeys.  The road is difficult - go by train, reserved seat.  Border at night.  Checks documents and things.  But the children survived.  All for your money.  Benefits in Kazakhstan for students do not apply.  We are lucky that we arrived first.  At night they met, brought, settled (well done!).  Standard Soviet one-bedroom apartment with improved planning.  Toilet, bathroom separately.  Kitchen with fridge, kettle.  Everything was a little shabby, but we even lived more modestly at the Cosmonaut Training Center (room for 4 beds, that's all).  And there were beds for 7 people.  They say that one of the tourists is capricious, and we were crazy. <br><br>  <b>What have you been shown?</b> <br>  They drove and showed a lot.  We looked at the last (most recent) Zenith, which the satellite will be lucky.  Showed "Union", starting March 31.  Patted the "grasshopper" - the energy installer.  We looked at the runway on the Jubilee, the launch pad "Energy", 31 pitch and Zenit start.  Were at the site of the tragedy on October 24, 1960. <br><br>  We visited the house where Gagarin and Titov spent the night before the start. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f6/d4c/a83/1f6d4ca83ae74354927e8d571d4f9f82.jpg"><br><br>  Museum chic on 2 sites.  Cosmonaut Pavel Vinogradov accidentally came in, took pictures with him <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a23/d44/5b4/a23d445b4467413782989ec96f42de69.jpg"><br><br>  In the evenings there were lectures at school.  Most of the films are familiar, but touch engines, sitting in TKS was great.  And for me, and, of course, for children. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e9/63a/473/7e963a473633443aac363d4a57e0d589.jpg"><br><br>  Hooked everyone and everything.  And neither the tight schedule, nor fatigue, nor the sand on the teeth and the cold could spoil the impression.  Seniors are thinking about the specifics of future work.  Katerina is drawn to the design work.  Eldar is more like science.  And Stasia aims straight at the crew.  But this is still the 6th grade. <br><br>  Well, the launch [Soyuz TMA-20M, started on March 19] is difficult to describe.  Delight. <br><br>  <b>How do you like Baikonur?</b> <br>  Houses are all of the Soviet period.  Old.  We lived in the 7th microdistrict, on the outskirts.  Immediately ran into the next quarter to watch the sandbox from the bottom of the H-1.  I'm in the Wikimapia in advance clambered all.  And the sandbox was removed.  It was a shame.  Then we reached the center, Lenin Square and the cosmodrome headquarters.  Lots of unfinished boxes.  Some of the old buildings are empty, with windows laid.  But the monuments are in order, and pretty clean everywhere.  Windshield, however, was.  The children are numb.  But suffered the charms of Baikonur. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea5/89a/212/ea589a2126b249fa8ea873b3c10ec5c2.jpg"><br>  <i>Energy Installer</i> <br><br>  <b>How did our students show themselves?</b> <br>  Our children were impressed.  In a sense, knowledge of the topic.  Stasya, answering why the rocket was white, and then without hesitation, who named asymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, was admitted to the snowstorm chair in the museum. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b8/674/b73/6b8674b7338b451692497b65bea03ba0.jpg"><br><br>  The elders asked clever questions.  Shatalov said that we will always be taken at cost.  We became friends with the director of the museum "Samara Space".  Elena Mikhailovna promised to help with excursions to Progress and very much called to herself.  I hope we will go in May, man 15. There was no competition, they gave certificates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64c/052/054/64c0520549bb4112bb42c797e795c371.jpg"><br><br>  <b>And what do the children themselves say about their impressions?</b> <br><br>  Catherine: <br><blockquote>  <i>The opportunity to see firsthand someone who has been outside the cradle of humanity, in a world that has not yet been explored for us, can hardly leave anyone indifferent.</i>  <i>However, even more emotions arise at the moment when these people take their last step before beginning the path to near-earth orbit.</i>  <i>At this moment you seem to merge with all people and feel the excitement and pride of the brave representatives of humanity.</i>  <i>I can not even believe that it is you who now stand just a few meters away from individuals whose profession is to reach the threshold of the unearthly.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It seemed to me that my heart sank when the cable-mast moved away, because it was a sign that the engine was about to start.</i>  <i>After the technological farms were disconnected, I only had time to mentally utter the phrase ‚ÄúLet's go‚Äù, when I saw a bright flash.</i>  <i>This included the engines of the first stage.</i>  <i>The rocket began to slowly rise, gaining traction, and the desert lit up like during the day.</i>  <i>We watched the rocket go until it went into the clouds.</i>  <i>It was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen.</i>  <i>And when I heard about the successful entry into near-earth orbit, I felt great joy for the crew of the ship and for the accomplishment of such a great cause.</i>  <i>I think it was those rare moments when a lot of people were like one, out of prejudice, resentment, dividing into friends and foes ...</i> </blockquote><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8WueJw3VN58%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhibD1mBO5b7girxIkTDUQ2j6ODy1A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Stasya: <br><blockquote>  <i>Very interesting museum of the cosmodrome on 2 sites.</i>  <i>Many exhibits.</i>  <i>But the most memorable - Buran.</i>  <i>We were the first of the group to climb the ship, and then along a vertical ladder directly into the cabin.</i>  <i>Of course, this is not a real ship, and he was not in space.</i>  <i>He created a technological model for training and testing.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Especially cool in the cockpit.</i>  <i>You sit in the pilot's seat, and in front of you are a bunch of instruments, switches, and levers.</i>  <i>And I want to think that he will fly, that all this is not in vain.</i>  <i>It is bitter that the real ship died.</i>  <i>But somewhere on the landfill there are still the same ships.</i>  <i>And maybe someday they or some others will go into space ... And here and now we can just touch this part of our great cosmic past.</i> </blockquote><br><br>  <b>What are your future plans?</b> <br>  Now came the position of the competition from the CPC.  Began to prepare in the fall to go to the Star. <br><br>  And I'm still there.  I write little articles.  The film will be mounted.  On the shelf there are pieces of broken glass from a searchlight on a grasshopper (not I broke it) and a piece of iron from the start of the P-16.  Well, a jar of sand from 1 site.  Stas math teacher ordered.  And I poured more into the jar. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392219/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392219/</a></p>
