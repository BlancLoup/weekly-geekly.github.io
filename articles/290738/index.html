The author is a leading seo-specialist of 404Group, Yura Semenov, has a rather original narrative style, so if you like the theme and the author, he will continue to create his opuses with pleasure. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In this article, I will not try to sell something to someone ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need it and I don‚Äôt need it, and I don‚Äôt know how to sell a damn thing.  Nevertheless, the described in this material will allow you to form an understanding of some simple things that are written on all the fences and proceed to the next step, namely: <a href="">Buy cheap attendant in Moscow cheaply</a> <br><br>  First things that should interest you: <br><ul><li>  How to monetize </li><li>  Payback and return on investment </li><li>  Competitive advantage </li><li>  Where to get traffic? </li></ul><br>  I prefer to assume that there are people on this platform who can find the answer to the first two questions, otherwise <s>what, sorry, what the hell are you rubbing here?</s>  answer them first.  Reading articles about someone else's success or failure will not help you with anything except a ghostly "I will never do that, because I read that it did not work for someone."  The third may not exist at all.

      Let's talk about the fourth part: where, in fact, take the traffic?  Where are all these crowds of visitors who dream to visit my wonderful resource?  And nowhere.  <b>Your site is not interesting to anyone</b> .  Seriously, well, that is, in general, all do not care.  That's the truth of life.  People are interested in satisfying THEIR needs - it‚Äôs them - they don‚Äôt care how beautiful your website is if it didn‚Äôt help a person find the answer to his question.  I don‚Äôt know how to answer the questions of all users if I knew on 767 to visit Page.  Therefore, the plan to attract the interested audience of the form: ‚Äúwell, we will write on several thematic platforms and gain success‚Äù is a bit naive.  Yes, they work if your project is really outstanding, but in this case you have to spend a huge amount of work with the press and the audience - are you sure that your project is exactly that? <br><br>  <i>!</i>  <i>Achtung: Yandex.Metrica reports are used, you can open the bombing in the comments about ‚Äúwho doesn‚Äôt use GA- that wonderful gentleman‚Äù.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c45/310/fb9/c45310fb90764321aed16b1866737405.png"><br><br>  <i>In the picture: ‚Äúdeep‚Äù pages are the final pages of materials (product, article, tricky sample, such as ‚ÄúiPhone from a single piece of gold in green‚Äù)</i> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">IMPORTANT!</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The article is not only about MFA sites. Everything described below is applicable for most sites with a large number of entry point pages (online stores, catalogs, etc.) </div></div><br><br>  If your model of receiving traffic implies that the main part of traffic is traffic from PS, and not social (if I‚Äôm not mistaken, then kudago.ru initially had traffic from social networks) or referral or some other, in other words, you want something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a7/1ee/435/5a71ee435ba64c44b96cbb6b0138e7f4.png"><br><br>  then you should know a few things. <br><br><h4>  Structure is an important thing. </h4><br>  And it should be not only logical, but also clearly reflected in the urle.  For example: site.ru/cat1/subcat4/alias.html <br>  What for?  First, it is easier for some users to understand where they are; PS is easier to understand to which cluster of materials of the site this material belongs.  Yes, you read all this more than once, and they tried to tell you this.  There is one thing that is talked about much less often - these are sanctions. <br><br>  Once we had a little spamming in one section of the site and grabbed it for the whole site (Yandex decided for a long time not to understand) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25e/e97/41e/25ee9741e48e49b6852b89f315824a7b.png"><br>  <i>Here is such an unpleasant host filter, although it could manage to filter on the section</i> <br><br><h4>  Provide "internal" uniqueness </h4><br>  It is not necessary to create a bunch of pages of approximately the same content with a small different block, try to maximize the unique pages: template, randomize, use magic!  In the following example, we did not provide sufficient internal uniqueness. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26c/c8b/f9e/26cc8bf9e65a4f36b13970966c2fd7df.png"><br>  <i>Subsequently, the problem was solved, and the traffic "returned to normal" at around 5000</i> <br><br><h4>  Cool articles don't always give visitors. </h4><br>  Even if the article is divine, it will not always get the deserved attention, therefore articles should be written, including, based on user requests, or create demand (but this is if you are already a large well-known site). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b14/914/740/b149147406014d379bce8f7d4493eee8.png"><br>  <i>In this example, we spent a fairly large amount on writing 54 good articles, but the traffic did not come from them (this is a graph from the internal analytics system based on GA).</i> <br><br><h4>  When will the content shoot? </h4><br>  Much depends on the type of content and your actions, but <a href="http://siliconrus.com/2014/11/seo-content/">this dude</a> did research and came to the conclusion that the content goes to a plateau by an average of 4-6 months traffic.  After some time we rechecked the theory, and the result turned out to be about the same (more than 10,000 pages participated in the samples, so the statistics are more or less true).  No need to shout that your article began to give traffic from the moment of publication and so on, the conditions for the materials under study were approximately as follows: there is a site with more or less good indicators, we published an article on it and did not use either twitter or likes - balls, or anything else that could help fast indexing.  After indexing is a reference and more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4bb/6a3/291/4bb6a3291c7f4dc3ba5c957543ad1624.png"><br>  <i>In the picture, the total average daily values ‚Äã‚Äãof the traffic of materials, separated by months after publication (the graph is based on a limited sample, about 1000 pages).</i> <br><br><h4>  Yandex is more reactionary </h4><br>  Well, or mistrustful of new sites - then who has some wording like more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e0/41c/e2c/6e041ce2c4c44938991ae0c6db4d5b4a.png"><br>  <i>Google started to give some traffic on the very first month of the project‚Äôs life; the next month I‚Äôve had enough traffic.</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f6f/6d2/294/f6f6d2294dcb48c892bb1f6dda51dbc0.png"><br>  <i>Yandex began to give significant traffic only for the 6th month.</i> <br><br><h4>  Complete recommendations </h4><br>  Since you have chosen a SEO-optimizer, who has written a lot of strange words and incomprehensible recommendations, finish everything that has been written there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc5/d24/eb3/dc5d24eb366b44a4a425cf45a72bf497.png"><br><br>  The life of the project was divided into several stages: <br><ol><li>  Seo we do not need, our project is beautiful and doomed to success! </li><li>  The first bell, the founders thought </li><li>  Traffic is back, all is well </li><li>  Urgent search for SEOs!  (at this stage recommendations were given) </li><li>  Recommendations are partially made, as soon as traffic began to recover, the rest was assigned </li><li>  Natural result. </li></ol><br><br><h3>  What is it all about? </h3><br>  Yes, actually, about anything that can help you with something.  Each project is unique in its own way and each project has its own ‚Äúsubtleties‚Äù.  I just wanted to remind you of the things that were repeatedly covered at various thematic platforms, but which are forgotten from time to time: <br><ul><li>  Nobody needs your project </li><li>  You need to take an audience somewhere. </li><li>  Frequently, PS traffic is the cheapest *, but not the easiest </li><li>  If you took up something, then it needs to be completed or not taken at all, otherwise it will be a waste of money. </li><li>  The coolest piece / article will not be popular if nobody knows about it </li><li>  PS is a machine, it operates according to a certain protocol, the less errors you make, the less likely it is to snip off. </li></ul><br>  * - although it happens (mythical one-cent traffic) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/20e/890/0e8/20e8900e878f4ece8e9cd830fce6d2e6.png"><br><br>  <i>Recall that if you are interested in this topic - waiting for your questions and comments.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290738/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290738/</a></p>
