  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Principles of work and life of Ray Dalio, one of the richest and most influential people in the world</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_x/an/hw/_xanhwddrlb8sfmhysjlpi7gn3c.jpeg"><br><br>  Most successful people we see and hear are not prone to introspection.  Experience allows them to make all the best decisions, but rarely does anyone invest time in disassembling their successful and unsuccessful actions into separate parts and finding a causal link between them. <br><br>  The author of this book is different from the rest.  From the first years of his career, the founder of the most successful hedge fund in the history of Ray Dalio, analyzed his decisions and tried to identify the fundamental principles that led to a positive result. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To obtain more objective data, the author turned to the experience of other successful people, with many of whom he is personally acquainted with.  In addition, Ray consulted with the best scientific experts to back up his findings with facts.

      The result of all this was the book " <a href="https://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/princzipyi/">Principles</a> ". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5j/q3/0y/5jq30yzfnnhngkc-kmntbb6rc2i.jpeg"><br>  <i>Ray Dalio on TED2017 '</i> <br><br>  The book is divided into two parts.  In the first, the author tells his story, focusing on the decisions made.  Ray's story was not smooth.  At one point, he lost almost everything and remained the only employee of his Bridgewater company.  And, after several decades, he built one of the most successful companies in the world (according to Fortune). <br><br>  In the second part, the author describes the principles of decision making in various life situations and building a successful company, in which the opinion of each employee is significant, and productive disagreement is one of the most effective tools for finding the truth. <br><br>  The peculiarity of these principles is universality.  The author tried to look at the decisions made from a higher level, thanks to which the principles derived can be applied both at the start of his career and in company management. <br><br>  During the reading, there is a feeling that the author was able to identify the fundamental laws and, on the basis of this, describe the principles that helped him not only become one of the most successful and influential people of our time, but also build stable relationships with loved ones. <br><br>  <i>Here are just a few of those who recommend the book of Ray: Bill Gates, Arianna Huffington, Tony Robbins, Michael Bloomberg, Tim Ferriss, German Gref.</i> <br><br>  Very often biographical books lack clear advice, while practical ones are written by theorists.  The book "Principles" combines the history of successful practice, prone to introspection, and specific tips applicable in real life. <br><br>  To give an objective assessment of the book <a href="https://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/princzipyi/">‚ÄúPrinciples‚Äù</a> by <a href="https://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/princzipyi/">Ray Dalio,</a> it takes time and practice to apply the knowledge gained, but according to first impressions, this book is the best I've ever read. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422027/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422027/</a></p>
