  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Messengers: a social platform for companies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The last few years have changed the business and the psychology of people in many ways.  Mobile devices have become the mainstream media environment - in the US even television has already ceded to smartphones and tablets most of the time and they have become the number one medium in consumption.  The same is observed in advertising, and in e-commerce, and in HR and in many other areas.  People love the app, they not only create additional value for consumers and customers, but form special relationships between people and between companies. <br><br>  The main symbol of the changes that the mobile ecosystem already produces is messengers.  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/chateam/blog/16462/">In the Top 10 most used applications,</a> six are messengers - WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, LINE, Viber, Kakao and WeChat, respectively.  WhatsApp has an audience of 800 million users per month, and Facebook Messenger has 600 million.  By the number of sessions, messengers occupy the first three places and also in the top ten of them six.  People even <a href="https://tjournal.ru/p/stop-calling-me">stop calling</a> - it's much easier to write.  Communicating with other people, with companies, with services is much easier through the messenger - this is a global shift in the psychology of users, in their communication with each other and with the world.  Messengers cease to be simply means of correspondence, these are already full-fledged social platforms that change both people and the world around. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c14/754/d4b/c14754d4b22977cfaac2450fa8710d95.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a>

    <blockquote>  Total mobile phones used 5.2 billion people, 73% of the population.  Of these, 40% have smartphones.  In fact, for most people in the world, the smartphone is the main ‚Äúwindow to the world‚Äù, this is the so-called mobile-only audience.  On average, in various digital environments, an adult user in the US spends 5.6 hours a day, of which more than half of them on mobile devices is 2.8 hours (51%). </blockquote><br><br>  So how can a messenger help a company?  First of all, communication via instant messenger creates a much greater degree of involvement.  The client does not correspond with the bot assistant, not with a distant email character, but with a live person who is present in his messenger with his mom, dad, friend and colleagues.  This is a very fine line, but the presence of a channel or just a person of a company in the messenger can repeatedly improve the user experience. <br><br>  In the second place, you can answer the speed of communication.  Mail and social networks is a one-way trip.  The user does not know who will answer him and when.  Even the largest groups in social networks can not guarantee the instant response that the customer and the consumer need here and now.  People write and leave, waiting (or not waiting) for an answer to the outside, because the very paradigm of communication does not provide for instant interaction.  With the messenger everything is different - you see that the user is online, the user wants and can receive an instant answer to his questions. <br><br>  Finally, many features of mobile devices can be used in instant messengers.  Send photos just taken, share a location, send and receive money - all this has already been implemented and allows you to simplify communication. <br><br><h2>  How does Chatim work for companies? </h2><br><br>  You can create your channel in the messenger and promptly <b>answer</b> your customers' <b>questions there</b> .  Due to the speed and the very involvement, you can solve problems much faster and with much less consequences for yourself.  Your channels can be located by keywords or title - all users will know that the messenger has your channel and connect to it.  Exactly the opposite is available for your employees - you can find customers and consumers in key groups and represent your company and your products to them.  Imagine that you are selling toys - would it be interesting to tell you in the chat channel for moms about your products?  You can easily find all the channels related to a specific topic and communicate there, drawing users into your orbit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/158/55e/64f/15855e64fb79455fa0989864d14910f8.jpeg" width="250"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b62/e92/cc7/b62e92cc76804646972ca1f3f698e78a.jpeg" width="250"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/904/f82/076/904f82076a6147cb806dee9576330e97.jpeg" width="250"><br><br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/chateam/blog/17082/">Within the framework of Chatima,</a> there are also closed channels where access is possible only by invitation ‚Äî such channels are ideal <b>for work teams</b> , employees of the same company or department.  You are in the same familiar environment in which you communicate with friends, you can communicate with business colleagues and solve them promptly.  Messenger removes internal bureaucratic obstacles, allows you to quickly communicate to teams.  For example, in one company there may be chats selling specialists, development staff, designers, marketing specialists, department heads.  Chats can be formed according to different criteria, not necessarily professional or official, for example, to discuss office problems (tea, coffee, paper run out), a chat can be created on a territorial basis or can be created by an event. <br><br>  In addition, in the messenger you can just <b>talk about their activities</b> .  Such public channels are also open to everyone, but only certain authors can write to them.  A great example here is the hour of the developers of Chatima himself - they write about new features in it.  Users can not comment on the messages, but the developers themselves can tell about the updates and what is happening with the application. <br><br>  Proximity, speed and functionality - this is what messengers develop on.  They have already turned into a new social layer, into platforms that are much more convenient and more interesting than all the previous ones.  Companies just need to be where their users are, speak the same language with them.  And from this point of view, an instant messenger such as Chatim is an excellent platform for working with the audience.  Both outside the company and inside it. <br><br>  <i>ChaTeam is a Russian instant messenger that focuses on thematic communication.</i>  <i>We hope that our ideology will allow including companies to more actively communicate with their customers, offer them help and communication on all issues.</i>  <i>While you can subscribe to <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/chateam/">our blog on Megamose</a> , already try the beta version of our <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Devyton.chateam%26utm_source%3Dmegamozg.ru">application for Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/chateam/id947384514">iOS</a> , subscribe to our groups <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/ChaTeam/1588297424785722">on Facebook</a> and <a href="https://vk.com/chateam">VKontakte</a> to discuss the latest news.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292528/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292528/</a></p>
