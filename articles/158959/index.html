It talked about the fact that, announcing a new category of devices - Mobile Internet Device on new processors, now known as Atom, Intel did not say a word about the participation of Microsoft in this project.  At the same time, I had no doubts that Intel came out with offers of cooperation to its main partner, but was refused. <br><br>  The first important point: shortly before, Microsoft solemnly buried its Windows XP and demanded that vendors install Vista even on the weakest machines with an Intel Celeron processor and 512 MB of RAM, on which this Vista did not want to work.  Installing Vista on the Intel Atom first versions was not even suicidal for vendors, but simply unrealistic. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The second important point: the Apple iPad did not exist at that time, it was introduced 2 years later, in January 2010. That is, even after Intel announced the creation of a platform for mobile devices (and I‚Äôm sure that Microsoft knew about this much earlier) , the software giant had two full years to refine Windows to a low-power tablet.  I specifically used the term ‚Äúrefinement‚Äù, since the Intel Atom has the same x86 architecture and command system as the ‚Äúadult‚Äù processors, so nothing fundamentally new was needed to be created objectively. <br><br>  The third important point: Google Android was also not present on the market - its first version appeared only in September 2008.  Therefore, Intel was forced to search for partners among the developers of free software and the choice fell on Ubuntu.  I don‚Äôt want to say anything bad about enthusiastic programmers, but when it came to such a serious project ... <br><br>  After some time, Microsoft still condescended to the fact that exhumed Windows XP and allowed to install it on new computers, which determined the appearance of netbooks.  It turned out as in the song: "I blinded him from what was."  And although the emergence of cheap and sufficiently functional devices has brought tangible benefits to the spread of IT in general, on other fronts of mobility events have developed more radically.  Google launches its Android, focusing primarily on the ARM architecture processors, which causes a significant blow to Microsoft‚Äôs position in the smartphone market.  Apple, in addition to the successful phone, launches the iPad - the very Mobile Internet Device, which was announced by Intel.  This is by no means an idea theft, especially since the idea is not protected by any copyrights at all - the time has just come. <br><br>  Intel is trying to make an adequate software platform for the Atom hardware platform.  At first it was Moblin's own OS, then MeeGo, and Nokia, a major manufacturer of mobile devices, acted as a partner for Meego.  However, shortly there were serious changes in Nokia, Stephen Elop was appointed to the position of CEO, who had previously worked as head of the Microsoft business unit, and software collaboration with Intel was effectively terminated.  Intel became a partner of Intel, the OS began to be called Tizen, but even here something is not visible success. <br><br>  But it turned out with Android.  Since this OS is based on the kernel of cross-platform Linux, then God herself told her to be cross-platform.  Although smartphones and tablets on Intel Atom processors do not make up the majority, however, they fit perfectly into the android family.  At least, users who have experience with devices on ARM processors will definitely not be shocked when they switch to the Intel Atom platform. <br><br>  What has Microsoft done over the years on the mobile front?  <a href="http://www.content-review.com/articles/20966/">According to the operator MTS</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/167/42a/28a/16742a28a37e7a33854da500c01d4036.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Windows Phone ranks last immediately before the "other".  The tablet market is no better off: according to Gartner, Windows 8 from Microsoft, the tablets on which will be released after the October release of the platform, will be able to occupy 4.1% of the market by the end of this year.  What does Microsoft do in this situation, despite the fact that its native x86 architecture represented by the same Intel Atom is bursting into this market?  Optimizes your products so that, together with your long-time partner, to win back a defeat?  No, Microsoft releases its own hybrid on the ARM processor!  What came out of this, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158613/">Sergey Vilyanov</a> wrote in detail. <br><br>  I would like to focus on the main thing in this event. <br><br>  The design of the device.  In any field of design, traditions and experience are important - both of the design process itself and of its launch into production, as well as the assessment of the market reaction.  Plus marketing, service and other things.  Apple, Samsung, Acer, Intel (it is necessary to do the concepts) have the traditions of computer design, but Microsoft completely lacks it.  Of course, today you can order any outsourcing, but then it will turn out like in football, when our local team consists entirely of people very different from us.  This is me to the fact that any line should be consistently developed, become its own.  For example, the company Asus consistently develops the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtransformers and ‚Äúnested dolls‚Äù (on November 20, the Russian presentation of PadFone 2 will take place), and the additional accessory in the form of a non-battery keyboard would look very organic in their performance.  Just as an extra, because with a light keyboard, the tablet screen starts to outweigh, you have to put supports.  Sergey wrote: ‚Äúthe stand is very inconvenient, on which Surface rests in the desktop mode‚Äù - well, so who would doubt? <br><br>  Integration into the home network.  Sergey writes that ‚Äúthe inability to print a presentation slide or the text of an article on a home printer is saddening seriously.‚Äù  Honestly, I see no reason why manufacturers of peripheral devices after the release of Surface will write drivers for Windows RT - the reason is clearly insufficient. <br><br>  Applications.  Of course, "no Photoshop, K-Lite codec pack or even Total Commander can be rolled over here."  After all, what is important: Apple had its own path, Google had to find its own path, and Microsoft had its glorious path.  And if Google is strong with its universal network services, Microsoft has a huge number of applications built for classic Windows on the Intel hardware platform, and for the most part compatible with the emerging versions of the OS.  All this turned out to be lost in Surface, and what in return? <br><br>  The mobile platform train started a long time ago, and Microsoft had previously had the opportunity to decorously get into the carriage and take its rightful place in the car.  Something can be done now, if the company tries to press Android on x86 platforms, and will not rush into the adventure of crossing Windows and ARM processors, trying to create an "unknown animal", and at the same time copy Apple's business.  As the heroine Churikova used to say in a famous film: ‚Äútake your time to become the widow of Munchhausen.  This place is still occupied. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158959/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158959/</a></p>
