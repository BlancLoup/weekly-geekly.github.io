    <blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúHaving conducted enough interviews, I realized that while writing code, inexperienced people stumble not at all on complex and non-obvious tasks, or even on small tasks (for example, implement a coherent list).</i>  <i>Most of the problems they cause quite trivial tasks.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I decided to develop a set of questions that would allow me to quickly identify such "non-programmers."</i>  <i>For this kind of <b>questions</b> , I gave the name <b>FizzBuzz questions</b> , in honor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizz_buzz">game</a> played by British schoolchildren.</i>  <i>A typical FizzBuzz question looks like this:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><b><i>Write a program that displays numbers from 1 to 100. In this case, instead of numbers that are multiples of three, the program should display the word ‚ÄúFizz‚Äù, and instead of numbers that are multiples of five, the word ‚ÄúBuzz‚Äù.</i></b></i>  <i><b><i>If the number is a multiple of 3 and 5, then the program should display the word "FizzBuzz"</i></b></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>A normal programmer should write such a program on a piece of paper in a couple of minutes.</i>  <i>But what is interesting is that many people with specialized education cannot cope with this task at all.</i>  <i>There were even cases when candidates who submitted resumes for a senior developer job were spending more than 15 minutes on this program. ‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br>  Dan Kegel (Dan Kegel) <a href="http://www.kegel.com/academy/getting-hired.html">talks</a> about similar impressions when hiring novice programmers: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúUnexpectedly, many applicants (including those with master's degrees and PhD in computer science!) Find it difficult to answer simple questions.</i>  <i>I myself saw how people at interviews cannot write a cycle that iterates from 1 to 10 or do not know what number in the hexadecimal system comes after F. As for less obvious examples, quite a few candidates do not know how to apply recursion to decide which or practical task.</i>  <i>You must agree that all these are absolutely basic things, and if a person finds it difficult to answer such questions, then he simply has no programming experience.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I will take the liberty of speaking on behalf of all programmers who have to conduct interviews: we are <b>terribly tired of</b> communicating with people who, in programming, have nothing to do with their feet.</i>  <i>Believe me, if you can write a cycle from 1 to 10 in all the languages ‚Äã‚Äãspecified in your resume, if you can solve a simple arithmetic example in your mind and if you know how to apply recursion in a simple (but taken from real life) task, then you already head and shoulders above most of the people in our industry. ‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br>  After reading these three articles, I was seriously worried.  I really want to recruit freshly baked IT-specialists - those who have just received education, but have not yet had work experience.  In fact, guys should somehow start their careers, why don't I help them with this?  But the fact that a person who cannot write even the simplest programs simply has the audacity to call himself a programmer simply infuriates me.  I consider this an insult to those who bear this title by right. <br><br>  It is known that between the states ‚ÄúI learn to program‚Äù and ‚ÄúI know how to program‚Äù there is a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000635.html">huge gap</a> .  I thought that everyone who had submitted a resume for a programmer‚Äôs job at least once had this gap already behind.  But practice shows that this is not the case.  Moreover, I come to the conclusion that the preliminary screening of candidates with questions like FizzBuzz is <b>simply necessary</b> , otherwise we will be ineptly wasting a lot of time on interviews with programmers who are not. <br><br>  For those of you who consider the task of FizzBuzz too simple (it is, incidentally, intentionally trivial), I will give a comment from the post about the interviews to which we referred at the beginning of the article: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúI would not advise interviewing people to dismiss the FizzBuzz task as too primitive.</i>  <i>Rely on it, and you (as I did) will be unpleasantly surprised to see how many applicants do not even have basic programming skills. ‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br>  I think it is foolish to interview an individual without first looking at his code.  The interview process in our company requires the candidate to provide us with a fragment of his code even before the telephone interview.  And if it comes to a personal interview, then we will definitely give the candidate a small programming task that he must solve with us.  Nothing too complicated, just a little exercise for an hour and a half, allowing you to follow all the steps of creating a working application.  I must tell you that this strategy works great.  Thanks to her, we are talking about programming in interviews, and we don‚Äôt bother with <a href="http://www.codeslate.com/2007/01/you-dont-bury-survivors.html">hundreds of clever tasks</a> . <br><br>  The brief result is this: pre-screening is only necessary in order to allow yourself the luxury of interviewing programmers who really know how to program.  No matter how sad this fact may be, it remains a fact. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE:</b> <br>  The best FizzBuzz implementations in the comments: <ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/htranslations/111843/">Brainfuck</a> </li><li>  Magic with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/htranslations/111843/">plus patterns</a> </li><li>  Great <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/htranslations/111843/">PHP</a> Version </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298134/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298134/</a></p>
