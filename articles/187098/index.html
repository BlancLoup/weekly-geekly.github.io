Want with us?  Welcome! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ff2/acb/4ba/ff2acb4ba077cf2bde1de643fc39780f.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Who is Mr.  P ... PalitrumLab? </h5><br>  Our teams (we can say a ‚Äúconsortium‚Äù of various industrial teams has been formed) are the same developers, linguists, designers, marketers, system engineers, sociologists, testers, analysts, just like you.  Like everyone, we always considered ourselves very experienced and knowledgeable, we wanted high salaries and interesting projects.  Each of us worked in different companies, in different cities, and we all were engaged in different and quite ordinary tasks (‚Äúpuddle, solder, combustions, fix it!‚Äù (C)).

    <h5>  Once upon a time ... </h5><br>  Six months or a year ago, in search of the ‚Äúother life‚Äù, each with its own roads, we came to a new project and, even a little unexpectedly for ourselves, began to ‚Äúlight up‚Äù: we couldn‚Äôt do what we couldn‚Äôt imagine.  Because no one could imagine, except for ‚Äústupid customers and clever partners‚Äù, who only did what they asked themselves completely unsolvable tasks: ‚ÄúCan you predict who will win the election?‚Äù, ‚ÄúCan you make an automatic tonality?‚Äù  And in Spanish? ‚Äù,‚Äú Can you make an Obama button? ‚Äù,‚Äú Can you tweet the fire zone with tweets? ‚Äù, Etc.  interesting stupidity. <br><br>  Along the way, we, like everyone and always, learned from our own rakes, invented bicycles, and at the same time, in an inexplicable way, achieved interesting results, expanded, invited new specialists from unknown industries, developed in breadth from a sedentary lifestyle - the usual life of an ordinary team solving unusual problems.  We came up with beautiful words for our activities: ‚ÄúOperational Sociology‚Äù (the term was voiced by one of our most intelligent clients and has been actively used since then), OBD &amp; A (Online Big Data &amp; Analytics), ‚Äúreal-time social media monitoring‚Äù, and made out beautiful words to projects.  About some public projects already discussed in our <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/palitrumlab/blog/">blog</a> . <br><br>  And then, as always happens in life, point P came (or X, or G - an amateur): <br>  1. Our Platform and Smart Analytical Systems have healed a stable life, having stopped waking up SMS and voice robots due to night failures.  We are bored. <br>  2. We ourselves began to use our solutions in the off-office life: read only the necessary news, watch TV shows with evaluative opinions of the audience (the French call this ‚Äúsocial television‚Äù), show off in front of friends, predicting the results of the World Cup, not going to stupid films, and only good ones, to help parents and children to choose the right places for rest and a lot more. <br>  3. Google announced that it is closing GoogleReader.  And we used GoogleReader on smartphones and tablets. <br><br><h5>  The future is here! </h5><br>  We do not consider ourselves competent in the development of mobile solutions and were sure that several teams ‚Äúin Russia and nearby‚Äù would probably want to close the vacant niche after the GR close and would develop the ‚ÄúRussian-language GR‚Äù.  And we even tried to inform these teams about our readiness to help with information technology support, because by spring we had reached a good flow capacity and a convincing amount of the collected message base, and understood that the creation and maintenance of the Platform is a costly business that requires solving a number of non-standard tasks, and few in Russia can afford such a pleasure. <br><br>  Either we were looking badly, or the GR niche seemed of little interest, as a result, no one was found for a couple of months.  And again they made a decision: we are expanding the Platform, we are looking for the right and fast partners with experience in mobile solutions, and we are developing a product with three main functional blocks: <br>  1. Reader content streams (RSS, site pages, forum posts). <br>  2. Filtrovalka prefab thematic tapes (for example, all the messages from social media about the Olympic Games in Sochi). <br>  3. The viewer of the receipt of new materials in the accounts of different social networks: their own, as well as accounts of friends, interesting personalities, companies, groups, with the possibility of posting answers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/075/cca/1eb/075cca1ebe07fe7b9e2ede75704b92ee.png"><br><br>  NB!  What do we mean by social media: public messages and comments in social networks, twitter, posts in blogs, forums, materials of online media and thematic sites, review services, etc. <br><br>  A few weeks of active correspondence with a dozen companies developing mobile solutions from different ex-USSR regions, discussing non-standard joint development approaches and deadlines, discussing options for public action, and finally ‚ÄúHe said:‚Äú Let's go! ‚Äù <br><br>  So hurried, that very little time was given to inventing the name of the product.  The current working name of the product is (personal) Media Center - or just the MC, maybe someone who reads the post can come up with a prettier name - welcome!  For the decision will issue a valuable cash prize.  :) <br><br>  Since the Media Center is intended for a wide audience, we initially decided that it was necessary to involve as many experienced, intelligent and intelligent people as possible, with diverse experience in development and knowledge, as well as those who have experience using GoogleReader, Yandex.News. , GoogleNews, HotSuite, Feedly, News360, FlipBoard and many other good and useful programs.  We hope that within the framework of discussion, criticism, and statements of the proposals ‚Äúfor your beloved‚Äù, a convenient set for us (the people) of the necessary functionality and comfortable user interface will be formed. <br><br>  Therefore, we decided to open a corporate blog on Habr√©, where we will post all materials on functional product design, user interfaces, graphical solutions, etc.  - for public control, because then the public use (we work for this) this product. <br><br>  In the meantime, there will be a ‚Äúcreative discussion‚Äù, we, in the meantime, buy equipment in new racks, expand the Platform API, connect new information sources and reclassify old ones, increase the speed, accuracy and completeness of linguistic modules, train autoclassification systems, deploy new heuristics to identify spam bots in social media, we are introducing technologies for detecting fuzzy duplicates, increasing the percentage of geolocation and much more. <br><br>  If it would be interesting to someone to discuss such tasks in our blog or in person, we will be happy to talk with teams, experts and experts in the field of HighLoad-systems, linguistics, sociology, Big Data analytics, distributed computing systems, MapReduce, SMA (social media analytics), full-text search, product marketing, mobile solutions, integration solutions, development of applications for social networks. <br><br>  According to our very tight plans, the first version of the Media Center should be available to the general public already in September, if they want to try to play with it at the testing stage - again, welcome! <br><br>  There will be versions for the iPad / iPhone / Android / Web, the main functionality - for free, some advanced features like real-time and a large number of thematic tapes that will seriously load the infrastructure and which will be made into a separate subsystem are planned. <br><br>  We perfectly understand that in ten paragraphs it is impossible to tell in detail about everything.  In the coming days we will post design options here (our partners have prepared 4 primary options) and user interface, and now we would like to get a little more of your precious time on stories about your experience in using applications for working with information flows (content flows) and social networks .  Your real-life experience will help us to take into account previously unnoticed nuances, problems and solutions in the process of finalizing the functional design that is completing these days.  And in retaliation, of course, we are ready to answer your questions (except for ‚Äúdo we need it?‚Äù - because ‚Äúwe need it‚Äù). <br><br>  We all have phones, smartphones, tablets.  On gadgets: <br>  - What kind of "readers" (RSS) did you use, which one do you use now? <br>  - We have not met a single person who used GoogleNews to work with thematic news, several dozens of Yandex users.  News, hundreds of users GoogleAlerts.  And in what ways do you get thematic information (for example, on your professional activity)? <br>  - How do you "live" in social networks: use 2-3-N applications, separately for each social network?  Or do you use ‚Äúsocial aggregators‚Äù like HutSuite? <br>  - If you are a user of at least one of the above, what would you like to add to this aforementioned, or what, on the contrary, interferes with your work? <br><br>  We would also like to thank all the voluntary or involuntary (co) participants of the MC-project, and thank them in the future.  It remains to come up with - what option is the best thanks.  Do you have any suggestions?  - Welcome!  ;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187098/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187098/</a></p>
