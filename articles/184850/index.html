Despite the obvious advantages in ergonomics, they still cause some caution, compared with the traditional PC layout.  In this small review we will get acquainted with the MicroXperts M400-01 monoblock, and we will estimate how justified such a device is for solving a typical circle of working and multimedia tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d87/8af/813/d878af813b51c3592a9bc35f6fe756a2.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Monblock comes in a box of very impressive size.  In such boxes, MicroXperts system blocks are also supplied.  The box contains the candy bar itself, the power supply and a set of wired keyboard and mouse.  The quality of the accessories is medium, I have not had any complaints about the keyboard and mouse for a rather large period of their use.  Gamers may be disappointed with something, but for typical office tasks, a complete keyboard with a mouse is more than suitable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9e0/c22/eb9/9e0c22eb9ba37bb260147124fded3132.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/852/2fb/408/8522fb408ef3f7a84998fb492c573da2.jpg"><br><br>  The monoblock itself makes a strong impression at first sight.  Made in black and white colors, all of himself glossy and shiny, he is unlikely to leave anyone indifferent.  It seems to me that MicroXperts M400-01 will be in its place anywhere, in the openspace, in a quiet office or even on the table, at home. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed7/91e/8e0/ed791e8e038c51fd75c6c6ca2ead9816.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/631/684/9dd/6316849dd2d6bd5e113379f8b55ea3d2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb1/55d/f25/fb155df2562e49dab8936323364bec9f.jpg"><br><br>  Inspect the candy bar in more detail.  The monitor screen and the entire front panel are covered with decorative glass.  The glass is solid, the only hole is made for the microphone of the built-in camera located in the center of the upper frame.  This solution has its pros and cons.  In the pros, of course, a nice appearance of such a design move and protection of the display matrix from contamination.  Cons, however, also missing.  The glass surface is highly glare, especially with unsuccessful ambient lighting.  Also, the glass collects all the fingerprints and dust, which will certainly appear on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/593/381/b30/593381b30643bbc4f7505decbaa93ec2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/55c/7f8/655/55c7f865568a22cbd2e709ddacef2874.jpg"><br><br>  On the right side of the MicroXperts monoblock M400-01 there is a decorative panel of white plastic, under which is hidden the DVD-RW drive of the ‚Äúnotebook‚Äù form factor.  Separate bewilderment is the implementation of mounting a decorative panel.  The most reasonable thing you can do with it is to unfasten it and put it on the table, especially if the drive is often used.  In this case, the front panel of the drive with the eject button is not on the edge of the side wall of the monoblock, but a few centimeters closer to the center, so some training will be required to hit the drive open button. <br><br>  On the top and left sides of the monoblock, there are no interesting features and connectors, although I expected to see there at least a few USB and microphone and headphone jacks.  In general, this seems normal, but only until you need to insert a USB flash drive or other device into the All-in-One PC.  All the most interesting is located on the lower edge of the case, to the inspection of which we stole up. <br>  Compared with the rest of the monoblock - the bottom panel is just an oasis of possibilities for connecting devices.  Monoblock MicroXperts M400-01 has the majority of modern ports for connecting unsuited devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/292/c0c/b11/292c0cb119ad1c36c998d2252eb0abe4.jpg"><br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  2 USB 2.0 </td></tr><tr><td>  2 USB 3.0 </td></tr><tr><td>  Lan 10/100 / 1000MBps </td></tr><tr><td>  HDMI </td></tr><tr><td>  3.5mm microphone jack </td></tr><tr><td>  3.5mm headphone jack </td></tr><tr><td>  SD / SDHC reader </td></tr><tr><td>  Power supply connector </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  But the number of ports is small, especially since the complete keyboard and mouse eat up half the available USB.  In general, for most everyday tasks this set will be quite enough.  Another thing is that it is frankly inconvenient to connect the same flash drive, although a USB extension cable or hub will save the situation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b58/c4c/7f1/b58c4c7f16bb9a632899f941ac0b8b5a.jpg"><br><br>  Just to the right are the buttons for controlling the brightness of the monitor, turning on the monoblock and turning off the image on the monitor.  Above them is a row of indicators with blue backlighting.  The backlight is soft, does not hurt the eyes, does not interfere with work. <br>  The monoblock stand MicroXperts M400-01 allows you to adjust the position only in the vertical plane, so turning the candy bar under 90 'will not work.  MicroXperts M400-01 has a VESA mount with a size between the holes of 100x100mm, so if you remove the stand - you can hang a candy bar as your imagination suggests. <br><br>  Outside, everything is more or less clear, let's look inside.  To remove the back wall, you need to unscrew all the screws on the edges, some of them are hidden behind rubber plugs to match the body color.  Inside, the MicroXperts M400-01 monoblock is configured fairly freely and traditionally.  The motherboard in general could be called standard mini-itx, if it were not for the original cable that goes to the matrix. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c03/68e/102/c0368e10218ef84c5d0cdd0e6b0db743.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4bc/a0e/8fb/4bca0e8fbe803d0a37e42ace62f8e5e7.jpg"><br><br>  Let's run through the main specifications of the monoblock: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Intel Core i3 3220 3.3GHz processor (22nm Ivy Bridge) </td></tr><tr><td>  Intel H61 chipset </td></tr><tr><td>  Intel HD Graphics 2500 graphics card (built-in) </td></tr><tr><td>  4GB RAM (SO-DDR3 1333MHz) expandable up to 8GB </td></tr><tr><td>  500GB Hard Drive, 3.5 ‚ÄùSATA-3 </td></tr><tr><td>  DVD-RW DL Drive </td></tr><tr><td>  Integrated devices: webcam, microphone, SD / SDHC card reader </td></tr><tr><td>  23 "screen diagonal, no sensor. </td></tr><tr><td>  Screen resolution 1920x1080 (Full HD) </td></tr><tr><td>  TN matrix type </td></tr><tr><td>  Built-in Wi-Fi (b / g / n) module. </td></tr><tr><td>  LAN 10/100/1000 </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  The motherboard is based on the budget Intel H61 chipset, but for systems that do not require an upgrade, this choice is quite natural.  Of the significant and user-accessible extensions, the key is the ability to install a second memory module and SSD drive with an mSATA interface.  Replacing the processor is also possible, but when the user starts, they honestly warn that processors with a heat emission of more than 65W will not work at the maximum possible frequency.  Separately, I would like to stop at the CPU cooling system.  The processor cooler is implemented very competently and with a large margin of performance.  Hot (in fact, slightly warm) air is ejected through the upper grate, while the cooler runs almost silently.  It can not be heard, even if you load the processor with the help of LinX ‚Äúheater‚Äù.  All that I managed to get in terms of increasing the temperature - 68'C with maximum heating of the processor cores. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/476/e19/e9a/476e19e9a3cc81bbace36776ca1f62df.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d38/560/52d/d3856052da8dd80d90064c2ddafbbdc9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/57b/3b8/283/57b3b82831fcd5f4a74ad09d2337b4b5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b62/e19/0a5/b62e190a5dab13ad395273da631753da.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4d1/ab0/617/4d1ab0617166b8facfb515eac576573f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ba/75d/fba/6ba75dfba8a1d427b1d13ea7ec596748.jpg"><br><br>  Check performance.  Monoblock MicroXperts M400-01 according to its characteristics does not differ from the system unit of such a layout and the ‚Äúclassical‚Äù performance, the tests carried out confirm this further. <br>  First, a Windows evaluation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4b0/b24/59d/4b0b2459d08be2b9664c0c9086191283.png"><br><br>  The indicators are very decent.  Problems with performance and a typical set of office and multimedia tasks will not arise. <br><br>  Then a couple of graphics tests, where without them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/645/5e5/f8c/6455e5f8c950549536bb8d12fbc07924.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fd3/243/090/fd32430907d5d52de51a916ec0b7afe8.png"><br><br>  Here, too, without surprises.  Built-in graphics for modern voracious games are not suitable, but with some reservations to play it will turn out. <br><br>  Hard Drive Test.  Here we have everything that a standard desktop magnetic disk drive can give us.  If you want more, install an SSD, the benefit of the MicroXperts M400-01 makes it easy and simple, without drastic measures like removing a DVD or giving up the complete hard drive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/076/502/99f/07650299f8a1dfe7472866cf66e3006f.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/45e/d97/09d/45ed9709d2103ee78e82565758228735.png"><br><br>  Webcam and microphone.  MicroXperts M400-01 is equipped with a 1.3 megapixel webcam and a built-in microphone.  There are no special complaints about image quality, color reproduction and clarity are normal.  But the microphone, unfortunately, cannot boast of good sound recording quality.  Even with the maximum gain in the driver, the speech is audible. <br><br>  Built-in speakers and sound.  MicroXperts M400-01 has a pair of small stereo speakers located on the bottom of the mounting panel.  The sound is quite loud and clear.  Naturally, with low frequencies, with this size of the speakers, not everything is smooth, the bass at maximum volume may sound hoarse, but on the whole everything is fine with sound. <br><br>  We conclude testing with a set of informational screenshots: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d5/b71/486/9d5b714865331913cd91cea854275aa8.gif"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9dc/8aa/c90/9dc8aac9093b64076b971b7e8e2b5812.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/686/2b7/821/6862b7821d618792cf52967f652fb035.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/623/b5b/552/623b5b552bee1543b88c7532bfbb9246.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/333/90b/116/33390b11668e374b0bd8e30e2c245f47.png"><br><br>  A brief summary and thoughts about the MicroXperts M400-01.  Having worked for the MicroXperts M400-01 monoblock for several days, I realized that I was almost ready to put up with design flaws.  I often don‚Äôt carry the data on flash drives and use the drive once a month, and at best.  Lighting in the workplace allows you to work almost without noticing the glare on the screen.  Otherwise, MicroXperts M400-01 has everything I need for comfortable work, the performance of the all-in-one block is more than enough for my tasks, the noise from the work is almost absent.  Again, using Wi-Fi and a wireless kit results in significant savings in working space and getting rid of a bunch of wires that tend to hang under the table and around. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184850/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184850/</a></p>
