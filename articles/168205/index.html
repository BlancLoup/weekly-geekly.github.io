  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 components of an advanced online store</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d4f/e13/cd5/d4fe13cd5b3e1fbc1cdcdcb3c6067e12.jpg" align="right">  <i>Any self-respecting online store should have the following functionality: sorting goods, adding to cart, guest access and tracking orders.</i>  <i>In addition, there are a number of functions that are not basic, but repeatedly improve the quality of service and shopping experience.</i>  <i>These functions are offered only by the few stores that make up the e-commerce elite.</i> <br><br>  So, here are five features that distinguish the best online store from just good. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Advanced Search Results with Tips </h4><br>  When a user enters a search query, it would be nice to offer him some options to choose from in the form of auto-filling the search string.  But it would be best if, even before clicking the ‚ÄúFind‚Äù button, you already show the user the intended search results for his query. <br><br>  Such a function will instantly provide the buyer with all the necessary information about the product: price, brief description, category name, image, without requiring any additional actions from the user. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      As an excellent example, you can take the online store Altrec, in which this function is implemented very elegantly, offering at the same time several options for autocomplete, and a number of expected results on one of the possible requests.  Autocomplete shows the user what options are possible at all and what else he can find besides what is displayed in the preliminary results.  At the same time, there is a high probability that among the preliminary results, the right product appears to the user, and the buyer can immediately go to the product page, bypassing the extra steps. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e59/b62/76f/e59b6276f7205df6ce5fe62d412938b7.jpg"></div><br><br><h4>  2. Built-in validation of fields </h4><br>  Hitting during data entry for correct ordering can lead to the fact that the user refuses to buy at all, because there is nothing more annoying than to find out that some fields have been filled out incorrectly after clicking on the order confirmation button.  The built-in preliminary verification of the correctness of filling in the fields will significantly increase the likelihood that your client will fill out all the necessary forms correctly the first time and will be satisfied with the service, and you will in turn receive a correctly completed order and reduce the likelihood of errors. <br><br>  An additional advantage of this function is also the ability to establish a dialogue with the user through short messages next to the fields (both correctly filled in and not), which will improve the overall impression of your store and force the buyer to return to you once again.  However, it is worth adding an important note: as mentioned in the article ‚Äú <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/09/04/the-state-of-e-commerce-checkout-design-2012/">The State Of E-Commerce Checkout Design 2012</a> ‚Äù in Smashing Magazine, checking the correctness of address fields is not always the right solution.  The reason is that sites that refuse the user to place an order because of an inappropriate address format will definitely lose customers.  That is why it is better to ignore the verification of address fields. <br><br>  But where correctness is really important is in the fields with email address, bank card number, zip code, etc. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/674/4b5/b9b/6744b5b9b39ade7a6a8b7189a17a9e30.jpg"></div><br><br><h4>  3. Animated basket </h4><br>  Some online stores are not in a hurry to send the buyer to checkout immediately after adding the product to the basket and do the right thing.  This gives the user an incentive to continue virtual shopping and, ultimately, increases the store's revenue.  This is where the animated basket comes into play.  This is an effective way to give the user confirmation that the selected item has already been placed in his basket and that he can complete the ordering at any time, while not distracting him from further shopping. <br><br>  Online Store American Eagle reveals to the user a special area at the bottom of the screen, which displays the product added to the basket, the details of the transaction and the button to place an order. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ba8/7eb/e12/ba87ebe12c745588676fb4ba6f3cd0e0.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, the store Crate &amp; Barrel went further and implemented an even more convenient basket in the form of a pop-up window, in which the full amount of the order is displayed, as well as other products that may interest the user. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/300/0a2/5e7/3000a25e7af385532109fb48820ec67c.jpg"></div><br><br><h4>  4. Real-time inventory </h4><br>  Another reason for the frustration of customers may be the lack of the right size.  That is why it is worth keeping your customers not only aware of how many goods of a certain size are left, but also, preferably, when you can expect replenishment of the warehouse.  It will also increase the chances that the customer will leave a pre-order or sign up to receive information about the availability of the product, instead of going to another seller. <br><br>  Below is presented how the Threadless store solved this problem, immediately showing full information about the availability of goods. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d3b/b34/3ff/d3bb343ff94f5697ad46f7b7fee3f39e.jpg"></div><br><br><h4>  5. Demo video </h4><br>  Unfortunately, the features of electronic business do not allow the buyer to provide a complete product presentation.  However, a well-implemented product presentation can take e-commerce to a new level, giving the buyer even greater confidence in the correctness of their choice. <br><br>  A Zappos store, for example, uses a video presentation to sell a pair of Doc Martens shoes, as well as many other products. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ba/dee/a70/3badeea701f506d3b2b385af1f9a799e.jpg"></div><br><br>  It is worth noting that these are just a few of the most obvious and frequently used functions of online stores, which I would like to see in every online store.  Moreover, all these functions are implemented using the well-known technologies that, moreover, will not be difficult to implement in your site.  Consequently, there are no reasons that prevent the emergence of these and other functions in any e-commerce site that is striving for success. <br><br><h4>  Payment on delivery </h4><br>  Even with the introduction of all the described functions and tools in the online store, there is always a pressing issue of convenience of payment.  And if for payment online there are already many implemented systems, then with the receipt of money upon delivery until recently, everything was more traditional - cash or, in rare cases, a GSM terminal.  Today, a modern online store, in order to please the buyer, needs to accept payment by cards, even with delivery.  The recent, but already very well-known startup Jack Dorsey - <a href="http://squareup.com/">Square</a> (Russian copy - <a href="http://www.2can.ru/">2can</a> ) has spread in the US among small outlets and private entrepreneurs.  In Russia, online stores use similar solutions for receiving payment by courier upon delivery.  All you need is an Apple or Android smartphone and a mobile terminal, which is a device the size of a handsfree headset. <br><br>  All these functions were presented to push the creators of online stores to improve the quality of service and create a sense of customer care, which will make the Internet business a worthy alternative to traditional stores. <br><br>  Do you have experience creating or managing an online store?  What would you add to this list? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168205/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168205/</a></p>
