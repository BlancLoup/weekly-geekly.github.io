  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hello, spammers!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After reading the topic of a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/spam/41509/">web studio that had chosen the wrong way of advertising</a> , I decided to tell you, I think, a very funny story. <br><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that I don‚Äôt like spam, it‚Äôs bad for everyone, and the fact that people have to stir up large amounts of information they don‚Äôt need, and the fact that they have to configure spam filters and the fact that they have to think and talk about this problem instead of just use the mail.  And even by what leads us, among other factors, to global warming (energy is wasted).  But on the other hand, I don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôve been badly hurt by spam, because I don‚Äôt light up my mailboxes and, if possible, I switch to web services instead of mail in projects, which I wish for you. <br>  Nevertheless, spam does not bypass me.  It happened this time ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Among spammers, there is one type of customer engagement - the site is first made, then it is optimized for some not very common and valuable word and is displayed on this word in first place in search results (usually Yandex).  After that, spamming is done, calling to search for them by this word in a search engine.  Once we received such a letter, of the following content: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <blockquote>  Dear, blah blah blah ... <br><br>  We are a super duper professionally doing websites, all things ... <br><br>  In order to find us, type in Yandex the word - ‚ÄúHERE A SOME WORD‚Äù - and you will see us in the first position. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Typically, such letters immediately go to the basket (well, still - we also make websites :)).  But either the mood was good, or there was nothing to do (it was Friday night), but it wasn‚Äôt in the basket.  There was an idea to use someone else's mailing list for their own purposes, for which it was done: <br><br>  1. A completely simple one-page site site.ru was quickly created on which ‚ÄúSOME WORD‚Äù was also beaten <br>  2. In Yandex.Direct special accommodation was purchased for this word. <br><br>  <i>Mistress note:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>For those who do not know - ‚Äúspecial placement‚Äù is when your contextual advertising is shown not on the right, in a special block, but directly above the search results, i.e.</i>  <i>at the very first place (look for example a ‚Äútaxi‚Äù in Yandex - at the moment the first two links are special placement. <b>Upd.</b> those who do not see special placement in a taxi search - look in the comments below I gave a screenshot of how they look ).</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It is expensive, but the money is taken only for the transition to advertising on your site.</i>  <i>If there are two or more people willing for one word - the highest bidder will be higher.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Since there were no other people besides us, our click was cheap enough.</i>  <i>I did not deal specifically with Yandex, so I don‚Äôt know the details, but they are not significant.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  It remains to wait for the Yandex moderators to check our ad and launch it.  A few hours later this happened, after which we began to monitor the logs on our server. <br><br>  There were very few transitions from Yandex, or the days were unsuccessful (weekends), mailing list on a not very large base.  But after a while we spotted the mailers (or customers) on our website. <br>  They were clearly visible, as it was only possible to get to the website through Yandex advertising, and there were obvious transitions from other places, for example, from the mail web interface to mail.ru.  Probably, someone from their team saw our fraud and told the boss about it by mail, and from there he came to us. <br><br>  After a while we received confirmation of our thoughts.  The guys cut through the chip, and ... they also ordered special placement on the same word, and since they were not the first, they had to raise rates per click in order to force us out of the first place. <br>  Thus, the guys fell into our trap.  We immediately removed our advertising and for about an hour we actively clicked Yandex on their website (using, among other things, different IP) than actively spending their money.  Either they put a little money, or they understood what was happening, but they quickly enough removed their advertising.  We also did not begin to return advertising, since the enemy could already spoil our financial condition. <br><br>  As a result, we realized our goals, namely (in decreasing order of importance): <br><br>  1. received a lot of positive emotions (compensated for their irritation from spam) <br>  2. punished suckers spammers and spoiled their nerves and even deprived them of a certain amount of money <br>  3. very approximate, but were able to evaluate the effectiveness of such a advertising list, at the expense of others.  Since we ourselves have never engaged in spamming, it was interesting for us. <br><br>  Potentially, we could get a customer, if someone called us, we gave our contacts on our website "one-day".  But first, no one called, and secondly, we did not set such a goal, although it would be ridiculous.  Spammers also did not dare to call us. <br><br>  Each of us can do the same, it is not difficult.  Each of us can not just ignore spam, but also actively counteract it.  And then we will win! <br><br>  PS I haven‚Äôt seen spam emails from them anymore.  Maybe this is an accident, and maybe (I hope) they are thinking about something. <br><br>  Best wishes! <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41682/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41682/</a></p>
