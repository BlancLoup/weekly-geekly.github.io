  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dell and the United Nations Foundation make the world a better place</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The UN Foundation fulfills an important mission.  It helps the United Nations meet global challenges of protecting the environment and people's health, preserving peace and security, reducing poverty and supporting women.  The Foundation builds connections, collects resources and helps those who want to benefit the planet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e59/787/145/e597871457454bc0839d1aa01763fd32.jpg"><br>  Today it employs over 300 people.  They are located in different countries and need flexible but stable access to working documents and applications.  However, it was difficult enough to organize global work, since most of the state could not get convenient remote access to data.  The Fund also needed to strengthen security measures, because auditors regularly check the funds and grants listed and want to be confident in the protection of financial information.  The organization also needed to build a new IT infrastructure and create a data center for the new Washington office.  Of course, this infrastructure must scale easily and be relevant for at least another five years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For a long time, the Foundation was a regular customer of Dell, so the question about the service provider did not even arise.  We provided employees with mobile computers, organized a data center, and enhanced data storage security. <br><br>  Foundation employees have at their disposal more than 250 Dell Latitude E7450 high-powered laptops based on Intel Core processors with a pre-installed Dell Data Protection software package |  Encryption (DDP | ‚Äã‚ÄãE).  In addition, employees switched to Microsoft Office 365 and began using the Skype for Business application: this way they got the opportunity to participate in video and audio conferences from a distance.  And to ensure smooth remote work, we installed the Dell Networking W-3400 network controller and the Dell Networking W-AP105 / W-AP175 access point at the new office. <br><br>  A new cloud storage has been created for the Foundation.  It worked on the basis of Dell PowerEdge servers with Intel Xeon E5 processors, Dell Storage PS arrays and VMware software.  Connecting the virtualized environment was provided by the Dell Networking S4810 switches.  It is important to note that the Dell PowerEdge servers are designed not only for the current load, but also have a reserve for the future, and the Dell Storage PS is very easy to manage.

      The infrastructure security subsidiary Dell SecureWorks, which implements managed network security services, helped strengthen infrastructure protection.  The selected solution allowed the Foundation specialists to monitor the network operation 24/7.  To set up update schedules and maintain virtual servers, we offered OpenManage Essentials software, and KACE K1000 Systems Management Appliance and K2000 Systems Deployment Appliance complexes to manage hardware and deploy images on 450 desktops, laptops and servers.  In addition, the organization uses the Dell ProSupport service to support all corporate Dell products. <br><br>  Now Foundation employees can work from anywhere.  You no longer need to be in the office to get access to resources or participate in the discussion of working moments - they have powerful Dell laptops and a unified communication system.  This radically changed the very approach to the organization of work and the interaction between colleagues.  Even outside the office, an employee can work with others on an important document, discussing the details on Skype.  And thanks to the new equipment in the office itself, wireless traffic is optimized so that people can freely stay outside their workplace. <br><br>  Employee mobility and a new level of interaction between them allow the Fund to carry out its tasks even more efficiently.  And for a non-profit organization, this is especially important, because the mission that the UN Foundation performs is of global importance for the economy, health and well-being of people. <br><br>  Previously, it took about six hours to create a virtual image of the system and install applications, but now, thanks to the KACE K2000 software package, it takes no more than an hour.  This significantly reduces the time of migration from desktops to laptops and literally frees the hands of technical specialists.  Now the IT department of the Foundation may pay more attention to the tasks related to the direct activities of the organization, develop the technical side of the business and not worry about the functioning of the IT infrastructure of the office. <br><br>  The fund was able to raise the level of security, which is of paramount importance when it comes to regular financial transactions, fundraising and distribution of grants.  Dell SecureWorks instantly notifies the IT department if it detects the slightest threat.  This allows you to stop any hacker attacks, and to show our auditors a report on hacking attempts and their effective prevention.  Employees' laptops are now protected: Dell Data Protection software |  Encryption successfully fights unauthorized access to work data. <br><br>  New communication technologies allow significant savings on business trips.  Thanks to Skype and Office 365, the Foundation managed to reduce the cost of flights and telephone communication by up to 50%.  A total of costs for the maintenance of IT-infrastructure decreased by 35%. <br><br>  The collaboration between the UN Foundation and Dell does not end there.  We have successfully worked together on a project to support adolescent girls in developing countries, as well as a global program for the development of the economy in several regions.  And a strong technology partner will help to quickly and better implement new ideas in life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368073/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368073/</a></p>
