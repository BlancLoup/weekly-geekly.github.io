      1. Agreed on the minimum stage (2-4 weeks). <br>  2. Described the user story in steps. <br>  3. Compiled a list of screens of the future system. <br>  4. I registered the names of API methods and data formats. <br>  5. I requested test content and created tables with test data. <br>  6. Formulated from all this goals and objectives. <br>  7. Agreed on a work plan and set tasks for the task manager. <br><br>  But it was not there!  Let me tell you how everything happens in real life, and also share my life hacking how I deal with it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <b>Scan napkins (What we drew on the opposite?)</b> </h3><br>  The moment when the customer had a vocabulary in the cafe, and he moved on to the visual arts.  So there are maps of offensive operations to capture the world right on the napkins.  It is not always lucky to be present at the same time personally, then a photo of a napkin in an isometric projection falls into the ‚Äúno comments‚Äù rubric. <br><br><h3>  Life hacking: ‚ÄúHow did you come to this, mate?‚Äù </h3><br>  The client is difficult to articulate what he had in mind.  It is difficult to think over all possible options for the system, so I often ask him to tell about his life and how he came to these great ideas.  Usually, after this story, at a minimum, you can understand the main goals and objectives, because now we know from what reality these demons came to us. <br><br><h3>  <b>Perverted logic</b> </h3><br>  Open TZ and see what you think?  Portal with a virtual cemetery: <br><br>  * raise the burial in the top 100; <br>  * share the burial with a friend; <br>  * send burial home; <br>  * add to the necropolis; <br>  * add burial to the blacklist; <br>  * activate the VIP user card; <br>  * install antivirus; <br>  * casting; <br>  * group crypts with celebrities. <br><br><h3>  Life hacking: ‚ÄúDid I understand you correctly?‚Äù </h3><br>  Sometimes the customer is so passionate about his brilliant ideas that he cannot recognize violations in logic.  If you directly point to logical contradictions, the client will say that there are no logical contradictions, and you just do not listen to what they are saying to you, and we will do just that.  Resolved! <br><br>  And all, he needs to hear his thoughts in a few other words: <br><br>  - Do I understand correctly that you want to make the casting of graves? <br>  - Do I understand correctly that users will display crypts in the TOP-100? <br>  - I heard you correctly, that users will invite friends to mass graves? <br>  - Do I understand correctly that users will add tombs to the ‚Äúblack list‚Äù? <br>  - Do I understand correctly that celebrities dream of inscribing themselves in group crypts? <br>  Those.  you do not criticize, do not resist, do not argue, just clarify. <br><br><h3>  <b>Everything is clear (read my thoughts)</b> </h3><br>  - Register in our system and become famous and successful. <br>  - And what to do next? <br>  - Well, you have registered the first step has already been taken! <br>  - OK, and what is the second step? <br>  - Well, activate the card and raise your profile in the top 100. <br><br>  Iii?  I'd like to hear the recipe to the end! <br><br><h3>  Life hacking: ‚ÄúWhat if?‚Äù </h3><br>  Ha!  Everything would be perfect if the customer responded to the questions asked.  I do not argue, many answer, but there are those whose answers do not clarify the nichert.  They need a little different.  They need to draw a script in the form of a question: <br><br>  - What if the user has registered, activated the card, raised the questionnaire, but did not become famous and successful? <br><br><h3>  <b>Description of mathematics by drawing</b> </h3><br>  Money goes from here to here, here is a small arrow, and here are percentiles, these points are here, and there are these points.  Straight train station on a piece of paper! <br><br><h3>  Layfkhak: ‚ÄúAnd let's count it in XLS‚Äù </h3><br>  When I see something similar to mathematics, but without a test case, I immediately get scared, because I can well imagine what the developers will say to me before and during the development process. <br><br>  In this case, just ask for a test case does not work.  If the customer could make a test case, he would have done it and would not be engaged in visual arts.  Therefore, you will have to make a test case at least in Excel.  Not always enough "Excel" - perhaps you need MathLab or a full-fledged research stage, if you suddenly drew a DSP, or 3D calculations, or pattern recognition with blackjack and neural networks. <br>  The result of this work should be a set of tests that gives unambiguous from the point of view of mathematics results. <br><br><h3>  <b>Don't load me with details</b> </h3><br>  - We want to stream porn via the app in the AppStore. <br>  - But they will block us! <br>  - Do not load me with details! <br><br>  - We want to stream wi-fi divers from the coral reef <br>  - Does wi-fi work under water? <br>  - Do not load me with details! <br><br>  - We want to distribute 4G wi-fi from an autonomous router, but only to those who are registered in our database. <br>  - That is, will have to collective farm firmware for the router and go to China? <br>  - Do not load me with details! <br><br>  - We want to connect to the base of public transport in Moscow <br>  - Have you already reached an agreement with DIT? <br>  - Do not load me with details! <br><br><h3>  Life hacking: ‚ÄúThere was one incident here!‚Äù </h3><br>  Before us is a strategist who has his own vision, and nothing can stop his movement towards success!  Some minor details (laws of physics, modern technologies, policies of platforms) do not bother them - this is all just for technical specialists. <br><br>  However, there is a way to reach out to ‚Äúunwelcome‚Äù customers - this is a narrative.  They will be able to hear the story, about how: <br><br>  * On the AppStore recently banned your buddy for porn. <br>  * A guy on YouTube was trying to go in for winter fishing with a wi-fi action packed camera to see how the fish reacts to the bait (damn, I'm not joking now!). <br>  * As another friend of yours collective farm firmware for the router, and in Guangzhou he was thrown by a guide. <br>  * As you have been waiting for a response from DIT Moscow for a year and a half. <br><br>  It would seem that these are special cases, and ‚Äúit will be different for us!‚Äù But, not surprisingly, the customer-strategist believes bikes, especially those that their friends are persecuting.  From this comes another problem. <br><br><h3>  <b>D - Game!</b>  <b>(so no one does)</b> </h3><br>  - Let's spars the issue of ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù! <br>  - WHAT?  Uh ... Mmmm ... How?  Zacacheem? <br>  - To save on the search engine! <br><br>  - Let's write for the iPhone three applications that will be inside the iPhone to interact with each other! <br>  - Zaaaaaacheeeeeee ??? <br>  - For enhanced security: one will encrypt traffic, the other will follow the updates, and the third will be chat. <br><br><h3>  Life hacking: ‚ÄúWithout us‚Äù </h3><br>  When you are forced to make game, you must refuse.  I didn‚Äôt think of anything to do with this practice.  Pitchfork anyway.  Yes, if you refuse to make Game, then sometimes you have to quit, or refuse income.  But if you agree to do the Game, then you are allowed to turn your work into hell. <br><br>  Of course, there is a third way: you can persuade the customer to go the standard way and do everything correctly.  Sometimes I do it. <br><br>  In general, the method is as follows: <br><br>  * Ask questions. <br>  * Identify values ‚Äã‚Äãand needs. <br>  * Offer several alternatives to the customer, which he did not know or did not think about. <br><br>  Game can be of varying degrees of uproarism.  If Game is not too tough, then the customer finds himself some kind of inexperienced victim, who agrees.  If Game is too much, and everybody refuses it, then the customer sees the light, gets upset and leaves to plump, or in the most difficult cases, he tries to learn programming to prove something to everyone. <br><br><h3>  <b>C - Scheme!</b>  <b>(as we would like, but does not work)</b> </h3><br>  Sails got the clients out of Tinder. <br><br>  - Here we will have video broadcasts with girls, here we will have a chat, here we will charge money for voice calls to girls.  In all chat rooms, in video and voice, we will have filters so that men do not exchange phones with girls directly.  And then all are so tricky! <br>  - Well!  Are you sure that such a filter exists? <br><br><h3>  Life hacking: ‚ÄúIs everything else perfect?‚Äù </h3><br>  Usually, when developers see this, they cling to it with the brain and argue with the customer.  And you need to ask yourself the question: ‚ÄúOK, is the plug here, and everything else in this project is perfect?‚Äù <br>  Of course not!  After all, quirks do not go alone.  It turns out, for example, that: legal issues are not settled between the co-founders, they are in different countries and hate each other, some unhappy team has already started to cut it, now the project rests on a CD that is not readable, and you need to polish scratches ... <br>  And here you immediately relax, stop arguing and offer the customer to return to the discussion after settling all other issues. <br><br><h3>  <b>Collective creativity (editing in edit mode, ‚ÄúWord‚Äù - in rags)</b> </h3><br>  Imagine a nice international gigantic company.  In it TK needs to be coordinated with all departments.  We have proposed three options for implementation.  Do you know how large companies talk to contractors?  And here it is: ‚ÄúOffer us options!‚Äù (Always with a delay and ‚Äún‚Äù so in the nose).  So, some departments liked one option, the second - the second, the third - the third.  And all so chat in edit mode.  Will I be able to find out the TK that I get at the exit after the edits? <br><br><h3>  Life hacking: ‚ÄúWe are eating the elephant piece by piece‚Äù </h3><br>  The larger the project, the more implementation options, more edits, more technical risks, logical failures and understatement.  Therefore, I always try to persuade the customer to the minimum stage with minimal functionality.  But it is not always possible.  Of course, everyone wants to build a spaceship - it's much more prestigious!  And to start building a spaceship from the captain's cabin - this is an indicator of professionalism, after all, the truth! <br><br>  I have the 18th in the mail, and there is even the 23rd version of the TK of 6 pages.  Everything is already so zadolbalis that no one wants to bring it all together ... I want to be intolerable in production! <br><br><h3>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h3><br>  What is the path to the ideal understandable TK?  It is very simple: never start working until you get at least minimal information and materials on all items for the ideal TK, which I described at the beginning.  But there is a problem: you will never start working this way.  Therefore, in reality, it is necessary to dodge in every way, to use life hacking, to listen to the threats of customers, complaints from managers and developer discontent.  And Agile does not save from this, oh does not save ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320476/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320476/</a></p>
