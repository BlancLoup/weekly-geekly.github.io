I‚Äôll make a reservation that I don‚Äôt agree with everything here, but food for thought is nevertheless superior.  I quote here in a convenient form for reading. <br><br>  <b>UPD from Yaroslav: ‚ÄúThese are not‚Äú the rules of Yaroslav Greshilov ‚Äù, but the rules * for * Yaroslav Greshilov.</b>  <b>And they are not aimed at project work at all, but rather in order not to lose themselves.</b>  <b>A discussion of what happens to projects when applying these rules was not part of my task. ‚Äù</b> </h6><br><br>  <b>Rule one: it makes sense to work not ‚Äúon projects‚Äù, but ‚Äúwith people‚Äù.</b>  Projects still tend to mutate beyond recognition, but people, as a rule, do not change.

      For example, work on different projects over the past three years with one friend of mine has the following objective results: out of four projects completed - zero, money earned - close to zero, time spent - quite a lot, own development - significant, relationships with a person - are improving and develop, the desire to continue to do something together - only grows. <br><br>  What does this mean?  The fact that our interaction with him is for both is a space to try something incalculable, something that we have not done before, really is not necessary for anyone.  It turns out not so much, but this is our way to develop through each other and through what we do.  It would seem that after four ‚Äúfailures‚Äù any joint initiatives should be chopped at the stage of reflection.  However, cooperation with this person seems to me one of the most promising areas of life :-) <br><br>  <b>Rule two: you can not completely dissolve in what you do, and associate yourself with this business.</b>  My projects are not me.  They are only the means of my movement, self-expression, the exploration of this world. <br><br>  In this sense, it always helps to do several things with little connected with each other at the same time.  The need to constantly switch from one reality to another allows you to retain self-identification ‚Äúabove them‚Äù and requires constant questioning ‚ÄúAnd who am I here?‚Äù <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Rule three: the initiative must come from me.</b>  It makes no sense to wait for me to make an offer that I expect.  Others always need not what I need.  It is necessary to search and initiate affairs and projects independently. <br><br>  The consequence of the rule is: never agree to an offer, even if it seems interesting.  In this case, you must skip the offer through yourself and make a counter-offer, taking into account not only the interests of the customer, but also my own. <br><br>  <b>Rule Four: it should be remembered - what I do is not needed by anyone except me.</b>  The word ‚Äúdemand‚Äù should generally be banned for use, except in some highly specialized cases.  It should first look inside itself, and only then - outside. <br><br>  As a rule, if I do something that others need, but not me, I just perform the ritual dances adopted in this field.  They quite often lead to a satisfactory result, but do not give either the development of themselves or the contribution to culture.  But then why is it necessary? <br><br>  <b>Fifth rule: planning performs only one function - it allows you to decide where to start, having been in one of the possible options for the future.</b>  Further - the result of their own creativity, rather than following the plan. <br><br>  The first consequence: re-planning is necessary only in situations where it is not clear what to do next.  The second consequence: the literal adherence to the plan is meaningless, because it leads past the real state of affairs to an imaginary world that was invented at the time of planning. <br><br>  <b>Rule six: all that has a beginning has an end.</b>  You should learn to understand when my path is at odds with where the project is moving, and be able to complete it, reorient, or get out of it. <br><br>  The illusion of ‚Äúeternity made‚Äù should be avoided.  ‚ÄúThings‚Äù that I produce (in case of good luck and true commitment) can be eternal, but not my efforts put into this ‚Äúthing‚Äù.  It is worth remembering that I invest not in order to produce this ‚Äúthing‚Äù, but in accordance with my own goals and meanings. <br><br>  <b>Rule Seven: Communicate</b> !  Remember that consciousness is pierced in communication.  Genius differs from a madman precisely in the ability to build bridges between his inner world and reality.  Look for those who do not like you, and interact with them.  Only this will allow you to understand what you are really doing. <br><br>  In other words, making your own, you should check it on others.  To do someone else, checking it on myself, to squander the time allotted to me. <br><br>  <b>Rule number eight: sadly, rebirth is ensured only by death.</b>  If you want to be born again, die first.  Dying is painful and scary, being born again is exciting and exciting. <br><br>  It should be understood that we are talking about the death of oneself current (biological dying lies aloof from the problem under discussion, although in vain).  Remember, death is only terrible emptiness after itself, but by the same she is beautiful. <br><br>  <b>Rule number nine: have free time and be able to stay alone.</b>  Leisure and loneliness are the greatest achievements of man.  It is at this moment that you have the opportunity to reflect, that is, to use the mind. <br><br>  Remember also that loneliness that is realized and lived is the only source of your own, not borrowed energy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69971/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69971/</a></p>
