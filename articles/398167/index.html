Modeling is a serious sport, with its own rules, competitions and traditions. <br><br>  How much is this new and not all available (yet) 3d printing technology applicable in terms of modeling? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Modeling is divided into two large groups: bench modeling and construction of existing models.  During the preparation of this article, many people were professionally engaged in modeling in all its diversity. <br><br>  The most amazing thing is that opinions, regarding 3d printing, are sharply divided, so let's look at this issue in more detail.

    <h3>  Architectural Layouts </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/569/1d9/fa5/5691d9fa550f40ae943876cbac76d95b.jpg"></div><br>  With the advent of modern CAD systems and the technology of 3d printing, architects gladly threw to the side paper and glue.  This technology has taken root here perfectly.  Now there is no need to hover over paper drawings, and having already prepared a three-dimensional model, send it to print does not constitute any problems. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe university has long been designing everything in AutoCad or similar systems, and having bought a printer, I have a huge amount of time released that I can spend on anything.  Although sometimes, customers of the models ask for it to be made of paper, but this is not often, the main result is ‚Äú- one of the students of architects told us. <br><br>  In our experience, using a 3D printer, you can speed up work, for example, you can immediately print out a whole segment of a building with all the details, including colors in one go, using printers, especially powder, you can print very complex shapes - everything that you can model in a computer. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/210/ec4/c48/210ec4c48a404cf39cd92f7c2c02f689.jpg"></div><br>  On the other hand, if you have a simple layout that requires a large number of similar elements, a simple form can be put on an FDM printer and printed in large quantities for anything without distraction. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e0/b7d/7b5/5e0b7d7b5fc44a659c0cc27c8ef8084c.jpg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86f/be8/e23/86fbe8e23bee47ea919a63ec8332000f.jpg"></div><br>  But there are drawbacks in printing, first of all, the quality of the surface, items made of powder material have shagreen, and color reproduction on printers with color is not very high, and printing such a small inscription will be quite difficult, although now this problem is solved by the appearance of full-color 3D printers with paper where the accuracy of printing and color is high enough. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dab/2f3/5cd/dab2f35cd64f4fc39372f7db44f3a70f.jpg"></div><br>  Products from an FDM printer are distinguished by their lamination of the surface and they require post-processing, polishing and priming. Also, much depends on the printing accuracy, for example, when printing a copy of a building to scale, all its elements are greatly reduced and they cannot always be printed, although photopolymer printers can , but they differ in high cost of material. <br><br>  <b>Advantages:</b> speed, low cost of material in some technologies <br>  <b>Disadvantages:</b> postprocessing requirement, insufficient print accuracy <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b2/0f0/f07/0b20f0f070414b82b39f63061ee581f2.jpg"></div><br><h3>  What layouts can I do with 3D printing? </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f60/fe1/ede/f60fe1ede1cd4fe587dea3d143d0530c.jpg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/100/710/9a1/1007109a1a8a4b4683a6bd580007d4bd.jpg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b0/0fd/6c6/5b00fd6c669740f6b0587426c2268753.jpg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c6/f3a/9f8/3c6f3a9f810f4753aacf8c4efc790704.jpg"></div><br><h3>  Historical and game thumbnails </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8e/d6d/5bc/b8ed6d5bcf094dcdab8736a2a4beb63b.jpg"></div><br><br>  Creating miniatures is also quite in demand in modeling, for example, when creating a model of a street or a building, people figures or miniature shops are often required, this can all be quickly and accurately printed on a photopolymer printer.  With your own printer, it is cheaper than ordering ready-made castings. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6a/046/64a/c6a04664a05f428a84b8ff12e0a222c2.jpg"></div><br>  Also, 3D printing is a great way out if you need a small series of shapes for a unique project, you only need digital models of the shapes you need and you can print the whole batch during the day, while making these figures for example, cutting them out of wax and then casting will take significantly more time and resource costs. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dda/603/352/dda6033527324955bfb17da248052e2e.jpg"></div><br>  But it must be remembered that after printing photopolymer products require post-processing, washing and additional rejection, it‚Äôs all not difficult, but it takes time, besides most high-precision materials for 3D printing are quite fragile, unlike purchased miniatures, which often pour out of more durable plastics. <br><br>  <b>Advantages:</b> speed, low cost, the possibility of making a unique product. <br>  <b>Disadvantages:</b> fragility of the product, the requirement of post-processing, the requirement of a good 3D model <br><br>  In this type of modeling, the main focus is on painting and design of models.  Many of them can rightly be called works of art.  It would seem that everything has already been invented before us, miniatures and figures have been sold by different companies for many years, choose and paint.  Alas, for Russia we face one serious problem, almost all highly detailed models are imported (Germany and the USA), and in the catalogs there are no models of Russian vehicles and miniatures of Russian soldiers, etc. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d10/639/388/d106393889cc4471afaa3b622599bd99.jpg"></div><br><h3>  Bench modeling of military equipment </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36c/e2c/ca2/36ce2cca29e5485691262dae525d8a0a.jpg"></div><br>  And here we come to the first contradiction of interests.  The fact is that the concept of bench modeling implies the creation of inactive models that are as close as possible (visually) to the original.  And if a model of an old sailboat is created, then the use of plastic is categorically unacceptable by professionals. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b7/b19/115/2b7b1911586846d1a429a55e82f93454.jpg"></div><br>  Most often, such models are made entirely by hand, adjusting each frame, fitting all the details to each other.  In essence, this is the whole essence of this hobby.  Although in this case, sometimes use CNC milling machines. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8dd/ebc/13e/8ddebc13e6dc48e8a86096beaecc5e5a.jpg"></div><br>  But if you step aside and look at the creation of models of modern technology, here you can use any materials, starting with materials that are classical for modeling: plywood, foam plastic, plastic sheet (even boxes from doshirak are used), glass fiber laminate, etc. <br><br>  In this case, the use of 3D printers is a godsend.  The main thing is to choose a suitable printer for the desired scale. <br><br>  For example, for 1:32 scale models, a Prism Pro or Hercules printer with print areas would be perfect. <br><br>  And for small and detailed models of 1: 100 scale and larger (larger scale, smaller size), photopolymer printers, such as Formlabs, are well suited. <br><br>  But do not forget about one drawback of 3D printing, which almost all available printers have - visibility of layers or in other words model's banding, after printing you have to remove this texture, although on good printers one layer of paint or soil is enough to completely smooth the model. <br><br><h3>  Operating models </h3><br>  Communicating with people keen on these hobbies, we were surprised to learn that many use 3D printers, but not all models. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68f/658/3da/68f6583dacd24322a88137763f232f06.jpg"></div><br>  Operating models are often equipped with powerful power units, sophisticated electronics, talking about high-speed models of ships, almost all car models (monsters, traggies, buggies, trucks, short-horses, rallies, trials, trophies), submarines and aircraft models (including on reactive) materials available for 3D printing can not withstand such enormous loads, or do not meet the requirements for the ratio of strength to mass or tightness. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b7/05d/ad4/5b705dad4b3d481cac235c53aa28574c.jpg"></div><br>  Therefore, it is allowed only to make decorative items.  The classic materials used in these models are fiberglass, carbon fiber, epoxy and polyester resins, high impact polystyrene sheet, stainless steel, titanium and aluminum.  In aviation, carbon fiber and aviation plywood occupy a special place. <br><br>  But there is a solution, and in cases where it is impossible to use the materials available on 3D printers.  Modellers print matrices, pour <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/materiali/smooth-on-mold-max-30.html">silicone resins</a> in them, and after curing, get large-scale copy models of the wheels required for each model.  In the radio model trophy, there is often a need to print the car body made of ABS plastic on a scale of 1:10, to subsequently shape the body elements of the future car from tin, aluminum, Lexan or carbon. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/33c/caf/313/33ccaf313c82476997b6f4631850da75.jpg"></div><br>  But, as elsewhere there are exceptions, for example, there is a problem to accurately manufacture the hull of the vessel (not a speed model), because any inaccuracy will lead to difficulty in managing or complete inability of the vessel to walk (sail).  Those who have access to CNC milling machines, use them to the full, but it is much easier in this case to use a 3D printer, because it can create a form that is not available for the CNC machine, and the ability to make details in the apartment or on the balcony without particularly disturbing neighbors and households.  In addition, the printer is autonomous and you only need to start printing, and at this time do your own thing. <br><br>  Separately, we highlight the use of 3D printers in aviation, and specifically in the creation of quadcopters.  In this case, everything is ambiguous, on the one hand, you should use the most lightweight and durable materials, but at the same time it is possible to symbiosis complex printed parts with simple but durable frame elements.  For example, the quadcopter frame may consist of carbon-fiber tubes, but the connecting elements to make on the printer.  And here it is important to correctly design the structure so that cheap crash elements break down during an accident and fall, while the whole ‚Äúfilling‚Äù remains intact. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b2/896/15f/6b289615fa574369a8212e6e4b99fb50.jpg"></div><br>  It is worth mentioning the OpenRC project, where people create printed radio-controlled models, while knowing the limits of their products.  This project can help you get acquainted with the world of radio-controlled models without much expense, master engineering, learn how to model and continue to use experience in life, or when creating more serious competitive models. <br><br><h3>  Applied equipment </h3><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/616/df0/370/616df03700104178aa71016f51cfb7f2.png"></div><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/personal/picaso-3d-designer-pro250.html">Picaso 3D Designer PRO 250</a> - 197 900;  Printing technology: FDM;  Working chamber: 200 x 200 x 210 mm;  Layer thickness: 50 microns <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6bd/fc8/2bb/6bdfc82bbc4a43338d688c42ce02a98e.jpeg"></div><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/personal/prism-pro.html">Prism Pro</a> - 245,000 rubles;  Printing technology: FDM;  Working chamber: 400 x 400 x 850 mm;  Layer thickness: 50 microns <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/228/357/e71/228357e71eae40d6a92ddfbd82f8a3b1.jpeg"></div><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/personal/hercules-strong.html">Hercules Strong</a> - 149,000 rubles;  Printing technology: FDM;  Construction area: 300x290x370;  Layer thickness: 50 microns <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/479/d64/d57/479d64d579dc4829bcbbf030714c20e0.jpg"></div><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/personal/formlabs-form-2.html">Formlabs Form 2</a> - 419 900 rubles;  Printing technology: SLA \ DLP;  Working chamber: 145 x 145 x 175 mm;  Layer thickness 25 microns; <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9c/f93/6e0/b9cf936e0c55457fa6b1072b27acac7a.jpg"></div><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/personal/mcor-arke.html">Mcor Arke</a> ;  SDL printing technology;  Working chamber: 240 x 205 x 125 mm;  Layer thickness from: 100 microns <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2b/013/b54/d2b013b545a04d51a307950d502ad381.jpg"></div><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/prof/projet-660-pro.html">Projet 660</a> ;  Printing technology: CJP;  Working chamber: 254 x 381 x 203 mm;  Layer thickness from: 100 microns <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a3/e93/1a6/4a3e931a62a2482fa05819fe4e8f623d.png"></div><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/prof/3d-systems-projet-mjp-2500.html">Projet MJP 2500</a> ;  Printing technology: MJP;  Working chamber: 295 x 211 x 142 mm; <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca4/381/828/ca43818285644e19a8a190b2acaca311.jpeg"></div><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/personal/russian-dlp-3d.html">Russian DLP</a> - 349 900 rubles;  Technology: SLA; DLP;  Working chamber: 124 x 70 x 180 mm;  Layer thickness from: 20 microns <br><br>  Want more interesting news from the world of 3D technology? <br><br>  <b>Subscribe to us in the social.</b>  <b>networks:</b> <br><br> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/top3dshop/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b25/fce/eff/b25fceeffa904b06ba0818fdef351e77.png"></a> <a href="https://vk.com/top3dshop"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c76/ee9/037/c76ee903753346c29abaa49280dfd828.png"></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/top3dshop/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f91/396/101/f91396101d2b4579bb273636bc6283fd.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/izgotovlenie-arhitekturnyh-maketov.html%3Frs%3DCM_review_modelism_GT"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/925/e7a/3b7/925e7a3b7e02499e833866f3b09f7674.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398167/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398167/</a></p>
