Indeed, our project is non-commercial, and more to you, habrasoobschestvo and all the engineers who read Habr.  We returned!!!  Hooray!  Now we have our own blog, as from a start-up company, thanks again Habr!  (I was very pleased with the quick response of the support service and assistance in switching to the corporate blog).

      <b>UPD_2</b> : So!  This post was published for several hours on Habr√©.  He collected a nice feedback.  A lot of work has begun on creating a comfortable web site based on Moodle.  Therefore, if you still have any wishes and suggestions - please unsubscribe them in the comments to the post! <br><br>  A few months have passed since the day when I posted the first post about an attempt by several ( <b>already</b> ) guys to create an open technical education system on the Internet.  And here are the first results! <br>  What started it all is described <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/237241/"><b>here</b></a> .  And what now turns out - we read under the cut. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So!  As far as you remember, in the first lines of the last post I described the very ideology of ‚Äúshots‚Äù, and cited as an example an animated video on the ‚Äúbasics of the theory of basing blanks‚Äù.  Now the situation has changed radically.  No, the ideology has remained the same, but the content has expanded a bit.  I myself and my new colleague (I was pleasantly surprised that I quickly found my first partner ‚Äî colleague :) it was decided to consecrate step-by-step complex systems that are executed for controlling machine tools or for writing control programs for these machines. <br><br>  And our collegial decision was the following: I focused on creating a cycle of videos about operation and programming in a <b>Siemens CNC Sinumerik 840D Sl turning</b> system <b>in ShopTurn</b> , and my new colleague began to look at the basic milling operations at <b>Siemens NX 8.5</b> . <br><br>  As practice shows, both directions are poorly covered on the Internet, and we‚Äôre completely silent about the presence of abundant content in Russian.  In order for the courses not to appear detached from life and to have a logical sequence - each of us chose one detail, and in the process of learning, we step by step make them (process). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e4/2d7/34a/3e42d734a73d41c28bfbe9fcc06d3660.jpg"><br><br>  Thus, at the end of the course, we will get a suitable part and learn how to program all the necessary operations for its successful processing.  In addition to the virtual clicks on the screen of the selected CAD, we show at the end of each video how the real workpiece will be processed with the specified parameters and cutting conditions.  This adds dynamics to the course and does not allow him to become a boring transfer of his experience. <br><br>  For shooting clips, the GoPro Hero 3+ Black edition action camera purchased during the holidays in St. Petersburg came in handy.  And the set with a suction cup purchased for it allowed to fix the camera in a large machine without problems.  Reliable and strong.  By the way, it's nice to hear how chips fly into the lens :) If it's not difficult, watch the video shown below, or just click on the timeline a minute before the end, and you will also hear this sound. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BcHxUkPrTTU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhjyQPq-uW82p54DVyxHCalHxk13zg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It was a report number <b>one</b> - on the part of the video.  Now report number <b>two</b> ! <br><br>  The domain <a href="http://opentechedu.com/">OpenTechEdu.com</a> was purchased to create a site on it that duplicates and supplements the information currently posted on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/opentechedu">Youtube channel</a> .  The site essentially involves a cataloger and classifier of courses and shots (so that it is convenient to search and choose what you want to learn).  Also, some coaches, lecturers pre-write the texts before recording the video (for example, I do so :), and from these texts, as you understand, you can get a great book on each course.  For someone it is convenient to view the course videos, and to someone and read in electronic form. <br><br>  While the site is sticking picture-stub, but before the end of the year I would like to deploy some engine.  And here I would like to appeal to you, habrasoobschestvo!  Please help with the choice, because  there were thoughts to fasten blogging WordPress, but besides the classifier and cataloger, ideas for creating online knowledge tests, feedback forms, and so on are new, which we have not yet thought of.  Help me please!  What is better to deliver?  And is there anyone who could help our project with this?  I have a knowledge of web programming approximately at the level of creating an html stub that you see on our website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/47c/208/91b/47c20891b16e4cacbc82f2a96c0be51b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>(!)</b> We also tirelessly ask all active colleagues to connect to our project.  After all, in fact, to make a video with a length of 5 minutes, to voice it and post it is not so difficult and long.  And you probably have a lot of interesting, including narrow topics (in the last post they wrote about wire cutting).  We are not limited in the nomenclature of content (as long as there is not much of it - it is easy to classify it), and we share everything from the field of technical knowledge.  Join now!  Help other people!  Share your knowledge! <br><br>  Speaking of benefits: to us in the center "Incarnation", where I work - since February, the guy-student Mikhail Nazarov, 22 years old, has been walking in all his free time.  Studies as a process engineer in the master's program at Ulyanovsk State Technical University.  Specialty: engineering technology.  Since  unfortunately, there is practically no CNC equipment at the university (we don‚Äôt take mammoths into account), then all its theoretical and practical interest in new products has moved to us.  Simply put, the guy constantly goes to us, learns programming and works on CNC machines.  Yevgeny and I give him practice theory alternately and answer questions. <br><br>  So what am I talking about?  And this is what it was: there was an opportunity to take him as a young employee to the " <i>National Championship of working professions in high-tech industries according to the WorldSkills (WorldSkills Hi-Tech)</i> " competition in Yekaterinburg (both of us are under 30, and the age limit at the competition: 25 years)!  We left with the thought: the main thing is not victory, but participation!  And they brought ... the <b>first</b> place in the competence "Milling on CNC machines."  Given that the guy was able to overtake his rivals - the best employees of corporations and various enterprises from all over the country.  How pleased he was, and how pleasant it was for us that the actual, fresh knowledge that was correctly put in a good head could work, produce a high result! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/931/0f7/add/9310f7addb93403c81c00bb485549f17.jpg"><br><br>  And on such a positive note, I would like to finish my story.  On the installation are videos with turning (3 pieces).  Chip there, too, but the time available for installation is a little less than it :( Therefore, subscribers, stay tuned! <br><br>  New friends - please subscribe to the channel, call friends and feel free to write constructive criticism. <br><br>  Well, to all of you, thank you in advance! <br><br>  PS Yes, I forgot!  Please rate our first intro video.  This is my second animation project in Blendere and the first render experience with Cycles (500 samples).  Maybe a little bit harsh, but it seems to us a certain rigidity and dynamism reflects the essence of the work of the engineer-technician :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242711/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242711/</a></p>
