  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Facebook refuses to transfer servers to countries with violation of freedom of speech and introduces end-to-end encryption</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The other day, the head of the social networking site Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, issued a statement stating that his company will not transfer servers with users' personal data to countries where human rights or freedom of speech are regularly violated.  According to Zuckerberg, Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/">introduces a</a> new approach to information privacy. <br><br>  ‚ÄúUsers must be aware of the fact that we do not plan to store personal confidential data in countries where human rights are not given due attention, including the right to privacy and freedom of expression.  This is done in order to protect data from unauthorized access, ‚ÄùZuckerberg said.  The list of countries is not specified. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It should be noted that Roskomnadzor is dissatisfied with the actions, or rather, with the inaction of the social network.  At the end of February of this year, the ministry drafted an administrative offense report against Facebook.  The social network <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442164/">did not provide</a> Roskomnadzor with the necessary information about the localization of the personal data bases of Russian users in Russia. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOn February 28, 2019, the Office of Roskomnadzor for the Central Federal District drafted an administrative offense report against Facebook.  The protocol was drawn up under article 19.7 of the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation due to the fact that the company did not provide the necessary information about the localization of personal data bases of Russian users in Russia, ‚Äùthe agency‚Äôs website <a href="https://rkn.gov.ru/news/rsoc/news65764.htm">reports</a> .

      The law on the storage of personal data entered into force on September 1, 2015.  According to it, companies must store and process data from Russians in Russia.  The social network LinkedIn, which refused to comply with these requirements, was entered in the register of violators of the law in November 2016.  Access to the network site in Russia is blocked. <br><br>  It should be noted that back in 2017, the Facebook company planned to open a representative office in the Russian Federation, in connection with which the company was looking for a regional representative.  Now the social network outside the US has more than 30 international offices.  There is no office in Russia yet. <br><br>  In addition to the previous statement, Zuckerberg announced that the company plans to introduce end-to-end encryption of messages on all of its platforms.  This feature currently works only in WhatsApp, as <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/news/2019/03/07/795897-facebook-shifrovanie">reported</a> by Vedomosti. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI believe that communication will increasingly shift towards private, encrypted services, where people can be sure that what they say to each other remains safe,‚Äù Zuckerberg said in a statement.  The entrepreneur compared the modern level of confidentiality with the city square, where people can share any information. <br><br>  But users of social resources need and space for private communication.  And to achieve this goal, the company will combine its services, Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram into a single unit in terms of communications.  This needs to be done so that users can communicate with each other in all applications. <br><br>  Work on the creation of encrypted messaging systems has already started, it will continue until the full implementation of encryption.  The ultimate goal is to create such a system for sending messages, in which no one except the senders and recipients will have access to the content of the messages, including the social network itself.  The user can not worry about eavesdropping. <br><br>  Experts believe that one of the reasons that prompted the social network to start such work is the desire to protect against antitrust risks.  So, Facebook will be able to declare to the antimonopoly services that WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger are connected with themselves too closely, and it will not be possible to separate them.  This is if the relevant authorities file a claim with the company.  This is evidenced by the professor of law at the University of Colorado, Blake Reid.  In principle, Facebook is quite a large company that owns a number of social services, which is why it can be called a monopolist, so the fears are quite real - sooner or later regulators will raise this issue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443084/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443084/</a></p>
