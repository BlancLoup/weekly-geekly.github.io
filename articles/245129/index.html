But what about the team of such a responsible object, what is the data center, which should work in the 24 x 7 x 365 mode? <br><br>  How to ensure that the team in the data center project effectively solved the tasks?  What are the measures to approach a candidate for the role of a data center employee so that he not only does not harm, but also brings maximum benefit?  These and other questions are covered in the articles that reveal the topic of the issue: ‚ÄúData center staff‚Äù. <br><br>  Despite the economic turmoil, the data center market is developing, new high-quality objects appear on it, the creators of which thoughtfully relate to their design, construction and management.  The incredible pace of construction of an energy-efficient and reliable data center was once again demonstrated by DataPro, launching the first phase of its second site in the promised time in Moscow.  In an interview with Evgeny Bogdanchikov, DataPro's executive director, interesting details of the approaches that the company used in the construction of its new-generation data centers are revealed. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Another focal point material - a photo tour to the IXcellerate data center - will allow you to familiarize yourself with the object, carried out in the best European traditions, to a much larger number of interested people than IXcellerate guests could do at a party hosted by the company in honor of the opening of the first data center center.  The key to visiting this facility is the fire extinguishing system using water mist. <br><br>  Familiarity with the construction methods of advanced data centers will undoubtedly enrich all those interested in the design and construction technologies of such facilities.  But no less valuable is the experience of real difficulties or even the problems that executors face in projects.  Experts of SKB Kontur company share their experience of migration to a commercial data center.  And about what surprises the staff of a poorly designed data center may encounter, says Fedor Klimenko, CEO of GreenMDC, in his article. <br><br>  The rubric traditionally paid attention - Questions to the expert.  In this issue, Pavel Romanchenko, the head of the OVIK (Department of Mechanical Systems) group of the ADM Partnership, answers the rather difficult questions. <br><br>  This summer, we conducted a survey among our readers, trying to find out, in particular, what materials interest the audience.  In response to requests, we publish recommendations for managing a data center consolidation project in the current issue of the ‚ÄúDesigning a Data Center‚Äù category ‚Äî the project itself was reviewed earlier in the February issue. <br><br>  The year is nearing completion.  For the staff of Media Grus, it was fruitful and intense.  We managed to do almost everything we had planned: we released four issues of the TsODY.RF magazine, launched the website <a href="http://www.alldc.ru/">www.alldc.ru</a> , which confidently took the leading positions, organized two DCExpedition expeditions (along the Luh river in the Vladimir region and in the Scandinavia data centers).  The guests of DCParty parties, which we organized jointly by Mastertel, managed not only to have a good time, to discuss the problems of the data center and telecommunications industry, but also to play the popular game ‚ÄúWhat?  Where?  When? ‚ÄùWith real connoisseurs. <br><br>  Recently another interesting project was launched - DCLady competition among women in leadership positions in data centers (materials on the last expedition and the ‚Äúwomen's‚Äù project are published in this issue).  We also launched a tablet version of the magazine In the Cloud. RF and are preparing to release a version of Data Center. RF for tablet users (the current issue is scheduled for January 15, 2015). <br><br>  But the most important thing is that the editors were involved in the thickest of events in the data center market, thanks to which we were able to attract new authors, almost double the audience and increase the subscription.  A lot of interesting and useful things await our readers ahead - participate in our projects! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245129/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245129/</a></p>
