Now it‚Äôs up to the other manufacturers to bring in new products so that the store shelves will again be full, and the buyer will again have the right to choose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/230/052/00d/23005200d0c43e51940ad98c06a58111.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ASUS will also take part in these exciting races, although the laptops on the Core i7 were released by the company last year.  Actually, under the cut - a small overview of one of them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the time of release, it was the first laptop in the Russian market, working on a new <a href="http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx%3Fid%3D43124%26processor%3Di7-820QM%26spec-codes%3DSLBLX"><b>Intel Core i7 processor</b></a> .  To be precise, it is equipped <a href="http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx%3Fid%3D43124%26processor%3Di7-820QM%26spec-codes%3DSLBLX">with a <b>Core i7</b></a> <b>Q820</b> <a href="http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx%3Fid%3D43124%26processor%3Di7-820QM%26spec-codes%3DSLBLX"><b>processor</b></a> (the nominal clock frequency is 1.73 GHz, and in turbo mode - 3.06GHz) - the top version of the mobile processor, which inherited all the best from the ‚Äúadult‚Äù brothers.  In particular, technologies such as <b>Turbo Boost</b> and <b>HyperThreading</b> (about the virtues of which have already been partially <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/80276/">described</a> ).  Can you imagine how surprised your friends will be when they see the task manager of a laptop?  :) <br>  4GB of RAM (DDR3, <b>1333 MHz</b> ) and the <b>nVidia GeForce GT 240M</b> discrete graphics card with 1 GB of onboard memory and CUDA support help the processor working on the <b>Intel PM55</b> chipset.  Additionally, two 320GB hard drives.

Well, thanks and on it :) <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  The first thing that will strike the user in the eyes when meeting with a laptop <b>ASUS M60J</b> (as well as the M60Vp model) is the material from which the top cover of the laptop is made (as well as some other body parts).  Yes, yes, this is the very fashionable aluminum with a fine polishing texture, made using evaporative metallization technology (I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/68664/">wrote a</a> little about this).  Actually, in addition to the aesthetic appeal, such a body is quite reliable in practice - I was convinced of this by the example of my EeePC 1002HA netbook with a similar coating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2fb/3d3/89d/2fb3d389d9ed9bf48c50a499bc12bea4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The dimensions of the laptop are dictated by the screen diagonal (16 '') and are (in mm) 392x278x33-44.  All this with a sufficiently large weight of 3.3 kg with a battery - from which it can be concluded that the device is designed more for the home (even, perhaps, for replacing the desktop), rather than for constant carrying with it. <br><br>  The widescreen screen (with a maximum resolution of 1366x768) is covered with a layer of protective glass, which in addition to the protective properties of the screen deprives the physical frame - long live a comfortable dusting;) To some extent this simplifies the situation with inevitable prints, but still, the glossy screen is glossy screen‚Ä¶ <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/06d/d63/b8d/06dd63b8d5637118c490ad579a313c02.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Immediately below the screen are two Altec Lansing speakers and a scattering of touch buttons (called AI Touch Media), which occupy almost the entire space between the speakers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d5e/5d7/f21/d5e5d7f210522b124f81d06a8934ebaa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  While working, they glow with blue light, otherwise they just allow you to steer music, volume, and also contribute a little to navigation in browsers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f56/bb1/b6e/f56bb1b6e4e3c27c7e89f0a195d8d107.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c4/8d3/11b/1c48d311b2843ef277fee9979586a753.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The keyboard is the same as installed in many ASUS laptops - black buttons with sharp corners and edges that have a small and quiet course.  A feature of this model can be considered the presence of a numeric keypad. <br><br>  Chrome-plated touchpad buttons are separated by a fingerprint scanner, which can be a convenient tool for logging into the system and authorizing in many places (using specific software like Password Commander). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ca6/6d4/86a/ca66d486a1e8c8682c2dc1d63185ddfc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, to enter the system, you can use the built-in webcam (here it is 2 megapixel) with the ASUS SmartLogon program.  Conveniently ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/de2/cf9/79b/de2cf979b90931df63744193b972deac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I will not describe all sides in detail - I will simply list a set of connectors that will pleasantly please any user;) So, 4xUSB, eSATA, HDMI, DisplayPort and D-Sub, IEEE1394, ExpressCard / 54, RJ45 and three audio connectors (including SPDIF).  Well, without a Blu-ray-drive and a card reader (on SD / MMC / MS / MSPro format cards) it didn‚Äôt do. <br><br><h2>  Performance </h2><br>  In the tested instance, Windows Vista Ultimate was installed, which rated the laptop with an index of 5.6 (the processor received the minimum rating, the remaining points were not more than 5.9) out of 7.9 possible.  But something tells me that the laptop will be sold already preinstalled with Win7. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/601/51d/952/60151d9521647f6e0146cc6c6e4534e0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the VLC program without any problems went all the films that were offered - right up to the hefty high-quality BD-rips.  The sound from the speakers is quite good ... from which I concluded that the laptop is ideal for watching movies.  Games ... it seemed to me that everything was fine with them too.  More precisely, I tried the only disc I had with the Crisis and the results were more than playable.  Under load, the laptop is moderately noisy, in idle mode it is heard very slightly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a91/5cc/254/a915cc254af9e368d327359ab4d1a752.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It is logical that the productive components of the system are not averse to a tasty meal - a regular battery (6 cells, 4800 mAh, 11.1V, 53Wh) is enough for only 3 hours of battery life. <br><br><h2>  Check weighing </h2><br>  <u>pros</u> <br>  - Practical body; <br>  - High-quality bright screen. <br>  - High performance; <br>  - All sorts of connectors - you can connect almost anything; <br>  - Digital keyboard and fingerprint scanner; <br>  - The presence of Blu-ray drive and a lot of disk space. <br><br>  <u>Minuses</u> <br>  - Scanty equipment; <br>  - Glossy screen and some parts of the body; <br>  - Heavy, short battery life; <br>  - High price. <br><br>  At the moment, the price of a laptop is 52 thousand rubles. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  They ask for good money for a good laptop - one can understand everything here.  However, the price is quite consistent with the content - unlike the price tags for flagship news;) However, the very fact of using multi-core processors is good news - you see, very soon healthy desktops will be true to be less and less common. <br>  The only serious problem is the battery life (the battery manufacturers have been in debt for the first year) - but in the case of working from the outlet it is not so scary;) <br>  The result is a good ‚Äúworkhorse‚Äù that can help the user in almost any task - be it surfing, watching movies, toys, or something for work. <br><br><img src="http://trendclub.ru//i/favicon.ico" alt="image">  All news about ASUS and Intel first appear on the <b><a href="http://trendclub.ru/">TrendClub</a></b> project - welcome! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/708/9b0/e71/7089b0e71e9d527392e9e21601567905.jpg" alt="image">  And do not hesitate <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/">to join</a> the ranks of fans of the company on Habr√©;) <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82675/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82675/</a></p>
