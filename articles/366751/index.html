  <section class="page js-page"><h1>BRUTAL story with a happy ending: a dog with frostbite paws got modern prostheses</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/20e/dc6/6a7/20edc66a78003b6d5c0c2c536037eccc.jpg" width="700"><br><br>  When Brutus was still small, his owner, who was breeding Rottweilers, left the puppy outside in the cold.  As a result, the puppy received frostbite on all four paws, and some parts of the limbs then had to be removed (and the operation was performed at home).  A crippled puppy will get the prospect of a joyless existence, since every step of the animal was very painful. <br><br>  But Brutu was lucky - he was taken from the nursery by a kind woman who decided to alleviate the suffering of the animal.  Laura Akilina, that is the name of the mistress of Brutus, was determined to give her pet a full life, full of pleasure and joy.  The main task was to provide the puppy with the opportunity to walk.  And this task was completed, and very successfully. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Laura contacted <a href="http://www.orthopets.com/">OrthoPets</a> , which specializes in the development of prosthetic devices for animals, and the Veterinary Teaching Hospital at Colorado State University.  Together, the specialists managed to create modern prostheses that replace the missing parts of the limbs for the dog.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      Naturally, the research and development of prostheses is a very expensive thing.  But Laura managed to raise $ 12,500 for Brut, as part of the "Best Feet for Brutus" campaign.  In addition to the organizations mentioned, the project involved Dr. Trent Gall, a veterinarian who performed a series of operations to adapt the limbs to prostheses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f90/ef6/490/f90ef6490d18b7b2a61383f5fe1980dc.jpg"><br><br>  After that, specialists from OrthoPets began the development of prostheses, using some of the technologies that prosthetists work with people work with.  At the same time, the developers did not want to do their work simply ‚Äúwell‚Äù, they set out to create ideal prostheses that could almost completely replace the paws of the animal.  By the way, the company works with very modern technologies, including methods for creating bionic prostheses that are connected to the animal's nervous system (only preliminary work is being done in this area). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/161/522/fcc/161522fcc804ab8a4ae3dec1992a0a1c.jpg" width="700"><br><br>  The procedure for creating a prosthesis consisted of three stages: protect the trimmed paws of the animal, adapting them to the prosthesis, make the paws of the same length, with the help of prostheses, and make the prostheses practical and sustainable.  After the prostheses were ready, it was also necessary to train the dog, teaching him to prostheses.  Needed a long work with a treadmill and patient rehabilitation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6b7/c0c/bf4/6b7c0cbf4207ab6b97d224763cf88dae.jpg" width="700"><br><br>  As a result, all stages have been completed, and now Brutus has received his artificial limbs, thanks to which he can lead a full life.  True, until the end of his life the dog will have to go through physiotherapeutic procedures, but his owner is not afraid, considering that he can do everything that depends on her. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366751/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366751/</a></p>
