We invite you to see what they are. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d81/d07/d2a/d81d07d2a2ba4f4c81932218063fa464.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Blocks</b> <br><br>  One of the most recent and at the same time most welcome is <a href="http://www.chooseblocks.com/">the Blocks project</a> , whose chip is modular "designer straps."

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf6/acf/ac7/cf6acfac76b94e08a18e17d855a1bbef.jpg"><br><br>  It is curious that the functionality of the clock can be selected, and each link of the clock is responsible for a specific function that can be discarded or replaced.  At the moment, funds for the project are collected on Kickstarter, and so far little is available from the modules: additional charge, GPS, heart rate monitor, NFC and ‚Äúadventure module‚Äù, but by the end of the project the number of available links promise to triple.  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2106691934/blocks-the-worlds-first-modular-smartwatch">In detail</a> . <br><br>  <b>2. Unique</b> <br><br>  A bit earlier, the project Unique appeared, where the set includes 5 "under-filled" and "non-removable".  This strap is addressed to fans of premium-class watches who are not ready to change their expensive watches to modern ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f0/812/671/5f0812671e3c4831a89953deeab550f8.png"><br><br><ul><li>  Activity analysis </li><li>  Smart notification </li><li>  Gesture control smartphone </li><li>  Loss prevention </li><li>  NFC, programmable for any action, and it can be used as a key in a hotel or a pass to a fitness club. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>3. Kairos</b> <br><br>  The project <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/kairos-t-band-smartwatch-best-of-analog-digital">with Indiegogo</a> , which was successfully completed, offered two options for the straps to his watch: with and without a display.  Hours at the same time were ordinary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4b/4d9/92c/b4b4d992c76f48879df347796842dc3d.png"><br><br>  Both models <a href="https://kairoswatches.com/tbands/tband/">are available on the official website</a> , and a model with a display, for example, allows you to control smartphone functions, receive information about incoming, notifications from social networks, as well as some fitness functions. <br><br>  The gadget was compatible with both platforms and worked on the basis of Arm Cortex M4 and its own OS.  The built-in 200 mAh battery should have lasted for 2 to 3 days of battery life. <br><br>  <b>4. Montblanc E-strap</b> <br><br>  For some models of its watches, Montblanc released the <a href="http://www.montblanc.com/en/discover/specials/montblanc-introduces-e-strap.html">E-strap strap</a> , which syncs with IOS and Android devices and gives its owners access to some of the smart watch features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f6/130/c00/0f6130c002a641ada1b42d118fd4a8fa.png"><br><br>  Among them: the ability to control the player and camera phone, receive notifications, as well as monitor their physical indicators: steps, calories and distance. <br><br>  <b>5. IWC</b> <br><br>  Back in May, IWC decided to give its customers the opportunity not to change the usual premium watches for wearable gadgets, and <a href="http://www.iwc.com/ru/news/iwc-schaffhausen-announces-iwc-connect/">promised to</a> launch the IWC Connect project.  The development was supposed to be an addition to the mechanical products of the brand, which would allow to control the functions of the phone, receive notifications and analyze the physical activity of the owner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98b/c29/735/98bc297353f24bd9a56df4ddc07e70c4.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen we saw that many of our clients and friends of the brand began to wear Internet devices along with IWC watches, we decided to cooperate with one of the companies specializing in digital technologies.  Together, we have developed an elegant, aesthetically balanced solution that will allow us to abandon additional devices on the wrist, ‚Äùexplained George Kern, head of IWC Schaffhausen. <br><br>  <b>6. Modillian</b> <br><br>  But an example of an unsuccessful <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/modillian-smart-strap-make-your-watch-smart">project with Indiegogo</a> is a smart buckle that should turn any watch into a smart one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73f/3df/a4c/73f3dfa4ca1a46f1b199f32c0144a807.png"><br><br>  Before the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/modillian/posts/275840419275341">sad news appeared</a> on the official Facebook page, the project promised to introduce basic notification functions about current events and reminders of what was planned in the calendar. <br><br>  <b>It remains to add that</b> <br><br>  Thongs are both a means of individualization and a great marketing deception!  Suffice it to recall how sensitively the Moto360 watched their watches, in effect it was banal to forbid ‚Äúto think out‚Äù their first version, making it impossible to change the watch straps without additional efforts.  Then the guys from <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/steelconnect.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dremeshki%26utm_campaign%3Dsteelconnect">Steel Connect</a> jumped over, making special adapters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/088/281/56e/08828156e5f9469cad906cd4f2501324.jpg"><br><br>  Exceptionally, the strap influenced the cost of the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/smart-chasy-sony-smartwatch-2.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dremeshki%26utm_campaign%3Dsony">Sony Smart Watch2</a> , and the all-steel model cost one and a half, and somewhere two thousand more!  With the same technical specifications. <br><br>  Apple with <a href="http://4pda.ru/2015/05/05/218343/">a number of reservations</a> in May allowed third-party manufacturers to make accessories for their watches.  However, accessories for Apple are a separate topic.  And in general, the Pebble seems to be the most democratic manufacturer on this background, immediately preparing the standard fasteners in the Time version for straps for its users. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368795/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368795/</a></p>
