  <section class="page js-page"><h1>For $ 99 OLO 3D Inc. promises to turn our smartphone into a 3D printer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Welcome to the pages of the blog <a href="http://www.icover.ru/">iCover</a> !  The San Francisco startup OLO launched its crowdfunding campaign on March 21, 2016, setting a preliminary goal of $ 80,000,000. At the time of this writing, on March 27, donations from more than 8,000 Kickstarter backers were $ 1,135,401.  Taking into account the fact that until the end of the term of representation, OLO remains 23 days, this startup advertising the cheapest 3D printer has every chance to become one of the most successful platforms in the history.  About what, in addition to the price of $ 99, managed to attract the attention of such a number of backers of the OLO baby printer, and what the developers promise us for this money, we will tell in this article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/21d/366/b87/21d366b8785a8dd29728103b26a82a28.gif" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  OLO is truly unique in its own way, as it is the first polymeric 3D printer in the world, which can fully control the application of a smartphone during the printing phase.  There are no components that are traditional for such kind of devices that track the correctness of the movement of the print heads.  Moreover, there are no print heads themselves.  The material for making the desired 3D printed objects are liquid polymers that harden under the influence of light in accordance with the space-time sequence specified by the software algorithm.  The screen of the smartphone acts as a source of controlled luminous flux, and a special resin-photopolymer created by the authors of the technology for this purpose acts as a material hardening under the influence of white light. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nDI9E_k0mA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgfYnjbAN0lGqtTqt-p5WJPHMDTEg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i><sub>As you can see, the idea is really simple: the smartphone is installed at the base of the printer and, using the application, is synchronized with the movable carriage holding the object in the desired position.</sub></i>

According to the authors of the invention, the device was not originally designed for mass production, but, inspired by the results, they decided not to stop there and make the 3D printing technology available for everyone.  This was the main incentive for the further development of the project. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Visiting the project on the Kickstarter page</font> </h2><br>  Are you a jeweler?  Designer?  Engineer?  Architect?  The manufacturer of seals and stamps?  Dentist?  Student?  Teacher?  Teapot?  A man with unrestrained fantasy, obsessed with embodying content in a form?  Then OLO is for you!  - Declare its creators.  The first significant step towards the user is the idea to use a smartphone as a half of the hardware, which is already in his pocket.  Taking into account the fact that the number of owners of smartphones (without reference to technical characteristics) is calculated to be a figure close to 2.2.  billion, the availability of technology in the future, even for some users, looks more than attractive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a42/067/217/a42067217bb313bda19f1db37795b388.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Work on the project, including the improvement of the mechanical part, the reengineering of microchips, the creation of a fundamentally new line of materials called ‚ÄúDaylight Resins‚Äù, took up to 2 years in total.  The current prototype version works with smartphones of almost any size or brand, turning them into a 3D printer.  However, the quality (accuracy) of printing is directly dependent on the resolution of the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/be8/b7b/746/be8b7b746e5a33192f3eb4f490c07751.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  The authors of the project have managed to make OLO "multi-platform".  All that is required to achieve the ultimate goal is a flat touch screen smartphone running iOS, Android or Windows.  OLO supports work with smartphones with dimensions of up to 162 mm x 82 mm x 10 mm and is capable of forming an object up to 128 mm x 76 mm x 52 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c13/064/d6a/c13064d6a293e181083f6f62a87977a7.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Simply select the print object, pour the required amount of resin into a transparent container and start the program, taking up your own business afterwards - the OLO will do the rest on its own. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9ce/c01/e15/9cec01e159c297da5059d902f2ac83ed.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  OLO rear cameras are designed to prevent light from entering.  This allows you to maximize the intensity of white light radiation from the display of the smartphone and speed up the printing process.  While the printing speed is not too high, which is largely due to the existing limitations of the technology: using the iPhone 6, you can print 1 cm in about 46 minutes (or 1 inch for about 1 hour and 55 minutes).  The application allows you to create your own or use 3D layouts created with any 3D scanning software, including Autodesk 123D Catch, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/245/908/504/245908504bf3fb4a8f06b251a576c59d.gif" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2b9/487/082/2b9487082a129c7803abb5b43fd00ff9.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/120/fae/a76/120faea76e7dba8fcb93fd6f94d6cffa.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  A mixture of 8 colors (white, red, black, gold, gray, turquoise, yellow, blue) is available for printing.  The cost of the bottle (without local fees and all other expenses) in the future will be $ 15.  And it is very possible that it is the patented consumables, and not the device itself, that will become the main source of income for OLO 3D Inc., especially in the long run, if the company is able to offer an alternative for tablets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e9/dc8/969/2e9dc89695b78bd1f87a411612b3d7a9.gif" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b5/e3d/5c0/3b5e3d5c0b3da2733df323307c449ec7.gif" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/61f/c61/e23/61fc61e23182279db721fe3d80046b93.gif" alt="image"><br>  <sub>The work of the device is provided by standard AA batteries.</sub> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dba/920/032/dba920032d662967d1cb8c95e97da49e.gif" alt="image"><br>  <i><sub>The application will allow you to share ideas and images of the created 3D objects in social networks, after which, if you wish, you can immediately implement the object in real forms</sub></i> <br><br>  The question arises: how to ensure the correct dosage in each case?  In order to make rational use of the resin, the process of calculating the required quantity for printing a specific object is performed automatically: the amount of the resin will be indicated by the printer itself after the print object is loaded into the application.  To prevent software failures during the printing process, the smartphone is switched to the ‚ÄúFlight‚Äù mode, Wi-Fi is turned off. <br><br>  OLO is powered by built-in batteries only.  The charge level is controlled automatically.  The application determines whether it is enough to complete a full cycle of printing a particular object.  In case the charge is not enough, the user will receive a notification before printing.  In this case, it is always possible to connect the charger to the smartphone inside. <br><br>  Kickstarter, as the developers explain, is only the first step towards the deployment of a global project and user feedback will be very important, thanks to which further product development will be possible.  At the same time, enormous work was carried out for the subsequent successful promotion of OLO to the market: a patent application was filed and legal protection of the technology was provided, the project partners were identified - manufacturers, distributors, logistics and main trade intermediaries. <br><br>  What is good OLO according to the authors of the invention: <br><br>  - Modern sleek design: elegant and seamless lines. <br>  - High-quality software that provides simple and easy access to information, the use of cloud technologies <br>  - The ability to use the most complete "kettles" in 3D printing technology. <br>  - Printing accuracy: along the XY axes resolution: up to 0.042 mm (DEP quality) and along the Z axis - in resolution: up to 0.036 mm (0.12 mm in the accelerated mode). <br>  - Ease of care.  No special chemicals are required to launder the working surfaces of the device ‚Äî enough clean paper towels and alcohol at the final stage. <br>  - Portability + Ultra lightness: fits into a compact bag without any problems. <br>  - Automatic leveling: no need for manual leveling and calibration. <br>  - No noise: the quietest 3D printer ever created. <br>  - Autonomy: 3D printer runs on batteries. <br>  - Maintenance: durable drives that do not require systematic lubrication. <br>  - Durability: made of simple and durable technopolymers. <br>  - The application for OLO will be open for further improvement by third-party developers. <br><br>  While it is not allowed to mix resins of different colors with each other, but work is being done in this direction.  Since the resin of all colors will be supplied in black bottles, special conditions for light during storage is not provided, it is quite enough dry and cool room. <br><br>  To make sure that everything OLO authors are talking about is true, we will have the opportunity already at the end of the coming summer, when the first users will receive the promised kits and form first opinions and feedback.  And we wish the team good luck and the implementation of their current and future plans. <br><br>  <i><sub><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/olo3d/olo-the-first-ever-smartphone-3d-printer">Project Page</a></sub></i> <br><br><hr><br>  Dear readers, we are always happy to meet and wait for you on the pages of our blog.
