      Once, a long time ago (about a year ago), my friends and I were talking about different hosting, good and bad, brake and nimble, etc.  The fact that they have weak equipment, and the fact that they have a large load, and that they are sometimes banal doson, as well as that sometimes incorrectly configured CMS itself creates an anomalous load. <br><br>  We also talked about the fact that there are many services on the network that can help evaluate hosting: there are services that measure download speeds from the site, there are services that monitor accessibility, and there are many sites dedicated to user feedback.  In the end, there are network utilities ping and traceroute! <br><br>  But suddenly it came to the realization that there is no measure of the performance of the hosting site.  There is no way to measure the performance of one hosting and compare it with another. <br><br>  So the idea was born. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>How it works</b> <br><br>  It all starts with the launch of the test. <br><br>  The test can run on your hosting anyone.  Any volunteer webmaster.  A test is simply a PHP script that implements a <a href="http://hostertest.ru/tests/help">set of reference operations</a> .  The execution time of each operation is recorded and added to the database.  It is clear that less time means better results. <br><br>  Each particular test carries too many accidents, it can be performed at the time of peak load, and therefore it may not be quite typical for a particular hosting.  I recommend webmasters to do several tests at different times of the day, so that the picture on hosting is more objective.  Usually after 5-10 tests the picture becomes more or less clear. <br><br>  The arithmetic average value of each characteristic is calculated for each tariff of each hoster.  These average values ‚Äã‚Äãdescribe the tariff, and the more tests, the more accurate. <br><br>  Further, all statistics and various rating charts are already built.  For example, the average "reference" hoster is displayed, against which all other hosters are evaluated. <br><br>  <b>What else do we have</b> <br><br>  In addition to tests on the site, you can leave feedback on hosting providers.  For example, you once wrote a blog about your host - add a link to our site.  And we have a review, and you backlink :) <br><br>  By the way, in the test results, you can specify the site on which the test was performed, which will also give a back link.  So, for practicing webmasters there is something to do. <br><br>  You can leave comments for tests, you can also comment on the pages of hosting providers.  True fearing an anonymous flame, I made authorization through OpenId.  Maybe I went too far? <br><br>  <b>Instead of an epilogue</b> <br><br>  The main salt of the project, its brain and heart at the same time is the base of tests, which is supplemented exclusively by volunteer webmasters.  At the moment there are 300 tests.  Probably it is a lot, but also a little.  Need more.  I hope that everyone who reads will arrange a crash test for their hosting provider. <br><br>  Waiting for your tests. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85091/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85091/</a></p>
