The first and main advice is usually the implementation of customer support technical support toolkit in accordance with the recommendations.  Mainly this approach allows you to translate unpleasant conversations with the business about the usefulness of the IT service into a language understandable to both, as they say, reveal the cards and show that system administrators are actually really busy all day fulfilling the wishes of accounting, administration, etc. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c2/780/d58/5c2780d587502315980857e9e39179cf.png"></div><br><br>  Further more.  The ITSM toolkit allows you to look at the entire formalized process of technical support at a different scale level and assess whether there are any unpleasant patterns in all this?  Do any parts of the IT infrastructure require regular calls to specialists?  In the end, after a systematic description using the appropriate tools, they allow you to answer the global question: ‚Äúwhat is happening in this IT infrastructure at all?‚Äù.

      It is believed that in terms of implementing ITSM practices on average in business, our country is several years behind the West.  Moreover, the problem here is not even in the mentality or peculiarities of business processes in our country.  For each business format, there are quite objective reasons for them that encourage managers to delay the transition to service management and, consequently, increase the efficiency of processes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Small and medium business often rests on the fact that these transformations require too large an infusion of resources.  In addition to expensive automation systems (among which we must also choose the appropriate solution), we need at least specialists who are ready to spend time studying the multivolume description of the service methodology.  In the labor market, they are not as cheap as we would like.  And even the potential prospect of taking the company out of the crisis (if it happened), increasing the efficiency of work, does not justify how much time it will take to spend (read, pay).  During the digestion of this knowledge base, a company whose IT staff does not exceed 5 to 10 people will have time to close several times due to lack of resources.  And choosing between working on existing methods and dubious prospects for the implementation of ITSM, business, of course, stops at the first option. <br><br>  And, nevertheless, the development of the service, and indeed of the entire market, still requires thinking about quality, regulations and predictability.  Even companies whose IT departments do not exceed 5 to 7 people already have something to think about in terms of automating and documenting their activities. <br><br>  Under these conditions, it would be quite acceptable for many small and medium-sized companies to find something like a ‚Äúsimplified and standardized ITIL‚Äù, containing for a start, someone already selected and configured a set of several key processes.  With such a product, it would be possible to start implementation without significant initial costs, try on some time-tested practices of interaction between business and IT, without spending a lot of time on unnecessary in this case, deep customization. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fee/a1b/3a6/feea1b3a6037d1d833782aebd0ea99f7.png"></div><br><br>  It seems that there is a solution and the problem is solved?  Not really.  "Typical" solutions really exist.  But the problem is that various ‚Äúsimplified‚Äù tools most often have their ‚Äúlimit of scaling‚Äù and cannot ensure the development of practices in the future, if such is required.  Some "fixate" only on template solutions, others - require programming (ie, a significant investment of resources).  With the prospect of being ‚Äústuck‚Äù forever at the standardized ITSM level or subsequently looking for a replacement solution (that is, starting the whole project again), enterprises do not see the point of starting implementation.  And the purchase and installation of industrial solutions they can not afford. <br><br>  Perhaps companies would change their mind if they could try a relatively low-cost industrial-level product in a certain simplified configuration.  This solution in the form of SaaS-services was offered by Naumen specialists to their clients. <br><br>  The recently launched SaaS service <a href="http://itsm365.ru/lp/index.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr">ITSM 365</a> , built on the basis of the platform Naumen Service Desk, allows you to automate the basic processes of interaction between business and IT, i.e.  provides not only the management of incidents and service requests, but also research of problems, change control, management of internal tasks and orders, as well as accounting for configurations and other IT assets. <br><br>  The main objective of the tool is the registration and further tracking of the execution of user requests received through all communication channels, taking into account the labor costs of performers.  In addition, the service allows you to maintain a knowledge base and service catalog, determining, among other things, the level of each of them (SLA), i.e.  response times for different types of applications.  The system allows you to control the time remaining on the SLA, and notifies the performers and other interested parties when approaching the end of the scheduled period.  And from a business point of view, this level is monitored through an integrated reporting system that allows you to upload data to external systems for subsequent search for ‚Äúbottlenecks‚Äù in service. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de0/c29/caa/de0c29caa01b2247cf506a626c9bef9a.png"></div><br>  The solution is offered in three versions, differing in the cost of monthly maintenance and additional licenses.  In the minimum version, in addition to a number of other functions, deep customization of processes is not available to users, but it is on all other tariffs.  Those.  To obtain the functionality of the ITSM industrial solution, enterprises will not have to initiate new implementations (and at the same time, retrain the business to use other tools).  It will be enough to change the tariff. <br><br>  For new users, there is a free two-week trial period. <br><br>  In general, the <a href="http://itsm365.ru/lp/index.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr">ITSM 365</a> solution makes it possible to test the simplest ITSM practices in your business relatively painlessly.  Of course, whether they will take root or not, largely depends on the chosen political path of implementation: on how it will be presented to the company's management and end users.  Alas, diplomatic solutions to problems are not embedded in any solution available on the market. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205908/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205908/</a></p>
