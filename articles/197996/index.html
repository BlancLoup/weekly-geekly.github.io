The new Lumia has a 41 megapixel camera onboard, Carl Zeiss optics, proprietary PureView technology and optical image stabilization.  In Russia, this ‚Äúcamera with call function‚Äù costs 27 thousand rubles.  I managed to hold the device in my hands, and this led to some thoughts. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For those who are interested in what kind of device - I advise you to see a preliminary review.  The rest is below.

A pity, the same 925th is admired due to its excellent body and ergonomics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6fd/8b3/888/6fd8b3888098d31f447977c009ba3ca5.png"><br><br>  The difference between the 920th and 1020th is only a round bulging 41 Mp matrix camera and a matte plastic case.  The same polycarbonate, but more practical.  Simply put - does not slap. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/845/b8c/928/845b8c928b720886222a911c0ded3386.png"><br><br>  And, of course, weight.  Where the Lumia 1020 has a clear advantage - 158 against 185 grams from the 920th.  And it is very strongly felt.  <i>I have been using 920 for several months and, I must say, weight is its huge minus</i> .  In this case, the dimensions of the two models are absolutely identical. <br><br>  <b>Lumia 1020 specifications</b> <br><br>  - Windows Phone 8 (Amber) <br>  - microSIM <br>  - Weight: 158 g <br>  - Dimensions: 71.4 x 130.4 x 10.4 mm <br>  - 4.5 '', color AMOLED, 1280 x 720, 332 ppi <br>  - 41 MP rear camera, xenon flash <br>  - Front camera 1.2 MP <br>  - NFC, Bluetooth 3.0, GPS, A-GPS <br>  - Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon S4, 2 cores, 1.5 GHz <br>  - Memory: 2 GB of RAM, 32 GB of ROM <br>  - Battery: 2000 mAh <br><br>  <b>Performance</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ae/086/da1/6ae086da132de4b2ee6b543ce7b6956f.png"><br><br>  The heart of the smartphone is a dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor, which is "perfectly" coping with its task.  Quick launch of applications and switching between them is provided with a frequency of 1.5 GHz and all this action is also with 2 GB of RAM.  The device in speed and response is at a very high level and is clearly ahead of both the 920th and 925th models.  The speed of the response is about 2 times faster than the Lumia 920. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c2/6ac/f1d/2c26acf1d54bea562c8692eddd605340.jpg"><br><br>  There is nothing revolutionary in the phone‚Äôs work time, the 1020th keeps a full-fledged working day, and with the Camera Grip extra photo camera, with 1000 mAh, another half will live.  Although, this is how to use: you can kill a phone with a cover and in half a day, you need to shoot yourself more than enough. <br><br>  <b>Camera</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae0/d25/a21/ae0d25a215d44ac0ebd64e05bfcaf434.png"><br><br>  But it‚Äôs not the speed that attracts attention, but the camera with a fantastic 41 megapixel by the standards of mobile devices.  All this is equipped with high-quality optics from Carl Zeiss and PureView, familiar to the Nokia 808. <br><br>  Perhaps this is really the best camera among the smartphones that I had to keep. <br><br>  The camera module is monstrously cool for a simple phone: <br><br>  - Matrix resolution: 41 Mp <br>  - Sensor dimensions: 1 / 1.5 " <br>  - Sensor type: BSI (backside illuminated sensor) <br>  - Maximum frame resolution: 7712 x 5360 pixels <br>  - Optics: Carl Zeiss Tessar (6 lenses) <br>  - Stabilization: optical stabilization <br>  - Aperture: f / 2.2 <br>  - Minimum focusing distance: 15 cm <br>  - Xenon flash / backlight up to 4 meters <br><br>  Very pleased with the zoom on the Lumia 1020, here are the photos taken by me on the Lumia 1020, 920 and iPhone 5s: <br><br>  <a href="">1020</a> <br>  <a href="">920</a> <br>  <a href="">iPhone 5s</a> <br><br>  I think the difference is visible to the naked eye. <br><br>  In all respects, the device is ahead of its rivals: Sony Xperia Z1, Galaxy S4 Zoom, LG G2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d7c/903/590/d7c90359013106790b193eeef52ea546.png"><br><br>  The network is full of comparisons, you can read: <a href="http://www.phonearena.com/news/Sony-Xperia-Z1-Clear-Zoom-vs-Lumia-1020-lossless-zoom-samples_id47875">one</a> , <a href="http://connect.dpreview.com/post/4485507296/shootout-sonyxperiaz1-vs-nokia1020-vs-lgg2-vs-samsunggalaxys4zoom">two</a> , <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/review/misc/Nokia_Lumia_1020_part2.html">three</a> , <a href="http://www.phonearena.com/news/Sony-Xperia-Z1-vs-Nokia-Lumia-1020-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-S4-Zoom-which-cameraphone-would-you-get_id47074">four</a> <br><br>  In each of the reviews Lumia 1020 wins, it's very cool, but I am confused by a few facts.  One of them: Windows Phone, I'm not a fan of this operating system, but this is not the main thing ... <br><br>  <b>What alternatives can there be?</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c2/a36/3fc/2c2a363fc04cf2ee885b5a5330ceafb7.png"><br><br>  Thinking about it, I was repelled by the possibilities of both hardware and software, as well as the price.  27 thousand rubles is a very large and large amount, and considering that Windows Phone OS is not the most popular in Russia, the conclusion is: there will not be a smartphone as popular as the Lumia 920. First, Nokia will have enough sense not to spend this time huge advertising budgets, as was the case with 920, which means the return will be much less.  This became clear after we all learned that even the official presentation of the 1020 for the media in Russia was not.  And will not.  Accordingly, for our country it is a disastrous product, which means that when you buy a new Lumia, you will not have too many ‚Äúassociates in the forums‚Äù - an unconditional minus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f52/48b/e83/f5248be838173366330f1ff6d1998c8e.png"><br><br>  Other factors also fit into this: people now use the phone as an <i>omnipotent video and photo recorder</i> everywhere - in schools, universities, at work, at home.  And Nokia knows this, but unlike Apple, Samsung and LG, Nokia doesn‚Äôt know that people don‚Äôt want to carry anything heavier than 130 grams.  People are well aware that without special skills from the camera Lumia 1020 will not work anything interesting.  "Everything should be out of the box" <br><br>  <b><i>‚ÄúWhy should I violate ISO, excerpt, exposure, and so on, if I want to just press a button?‚Äù</i></b> - the overwhelming number of buyers thinks about it, so Instagram photos from Nokia Lumia 1020, which don't even officially support it, won't collect more likes and they will not collect more reviews, because the main thing is what is in the frame, and not <i>what it is made of</i> . <br><br>  And as an example of how a person buys an iPhone 5s or something from Samsung or LG instead of Lumia, you can quote the words of the official National Geographic photographer, Jim Richardson: <br><br><blockquote>  With intensive use (more than 4000 shots in four days), I found that the iPhone 5S is a very capable camera.  The color and exposure are surprisingly good, HDR showed itself perfectly in work, and the panorama mode, combined with all of the above, just made me drunk.  By the way, the best new feature in the iPhone camera turned out to be square shooting mode, since I'm a big fan of clicking on Instagram. <br><br>  As soon as I realized that the iPhone 5S camera does an excellent job with its work, I began to forget that she didn‚Äôt know how to do anything at all earlier.  [ <a href="http://www.iphones.ru/iNotes/327955">translation of iphones</a> ] </blockquote><br><br>  I liked what Lumia 1020 can do, but after a while it came to be understood that it was just like that.  The phone itself is not.  He is very big, heavy and expensive.  And now Android is driving the mobile market, which means the overwhelming number will say no to Lumia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197996/</a></p>
