  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Are new Windows 7 new</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A couple of days ago, Microsoft introduced the next generation of its mobile platform - Windows Phone 7 series.  The Internet is already tired of discussing its innovative approach, its lateness or its controversy, depending on the opinion of the writer.  But now I want to talk about something else.  Why are these principles and such an interface implemented in Windows Phone 7 series?  Why here and right now. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In fact, no principle implemented in WP7 is new to Microsoft.  With this concept, they have been worn for more than 10 years, and have not relocated it until now. <br><br>  Let's look at two key points of WP7.  The first is a flat, minimalistic interface.  Before the release of Windows XP with a pizza-like interface on a lush cake, shiny with fatty spots, better known as Luna (in fact, only Plus! On the Windows 95 bootscreen was worse than it), the beta version, codenamed Windows Whistler had a much more pleasant, graphical, but minimalistic interface.  For example, as shown <a href="">here</a> .  Earlier, Windows Neptune, which did not go further than concepts, was even more like <a href="">Web pages</a> .  As for large fonts and contrasting scales, a video about Windows Longhorn (which later became Vista) on PDC'03 comes to the rescue.

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And the second element is the Hubs.  What Microsoft is so proud of now, the tasks collected in one place by type, appeared (more precisely, could appear) for the first time, all in the same Windows Neptune and was called Activity Centers.  Since then, every beta version has been scaring us with similar centers (this idea slips into the same video from PDC'03), and the last couple of years also WinFS, which implements it at the file system level.  And never, not one of these functions is fully included in the final version of Windows. <br><br>  It's clear.  Microsoft was always afraid to give the user a completely new experience, although it always screams about this before releasing the first beta of the new OS.  I think the reasons are the same, for which in modern operating systems there is still support for 16-bit programs.  Microsoft has always been difficult to part with its past and take radical steps, although very much like. <br><br>  Why now, and why on a mobile platform? <br><br>  I think the reason is that Microsoft already has nothing to lose there.  The mobile market is lost more reliably known polymers.  The longer you use Windows Mobile, the more you notice that the differences in Windows Mobile 6.5 and Pocket PC 2002 are even smaller than those of Windows 7 from Windows Vista.  Worse to do nowhere. <br><br>  But to try a new way and do better, it is quite possible.  Windows Phone 7 series is a platform for running in ideas that Microsoft was afraid to implement for many years.  And I‚Äôm sure that the success or failure of WP7 will greatly influence what future Microsoft desktop OSs will be.  So, as now the success of the iPhone OS affects other Apple products. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84752/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84752/</a></p>
