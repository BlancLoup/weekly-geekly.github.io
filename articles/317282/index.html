We will act differently - we will provide an opportunity to issue a pre-order for a unique solution, on the implementation of which we have been working diligently lately. ‚Äù

      And today we are pleased to inform everyone that the first dozens of customers who have made a pre-order between Black Friday and before December 1st have already received their ordered servers and a bonus in the form of a free rental period for new servers in December.  But it so happened that there were many who missed this action because of the publication only on Giktayms, some users regretted the action after completion and even <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/283048/">left comments that they very much regret that we did not inform about this action on Habr√©</a> . <br><br>  In this regard, we want to correct the injustice and provide a similar bonus (details under the cut) to Habr's readers and, moreover, to thank the community for participating in surveys and of course for numerous pre-orders.  Thanks to you, we were able to more clearly define your needs and provide servers as quickly as possible.  Thank you very much. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/af3/e88/246/af3e88246cb9055bcac95956f87dea86.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  You showed us what configuration you are most interested in: VPS (KVM) - E5-2650 v4 (6 Cores) / 10GB DDR4 / 240GB SSD / 1Gbps 10TB - $ 29 per month.  Of the 102 voters, 65 people gave preference to this option, that is, 64% of respondents. <br><br>  The second most popular option scored 20% of the vote: <br><br><blockquote>  VPS (KVM) - E5-2650 v4 (6 Cores) / 10GB DDR4 / 4TB SATA / 1Gbps 10TB - $ 29 per month. </blockquote><br>  More expensive options turned out to be extremely unclaimed, as expected: <br><br><blockquote>  VPS (KVM) - E5-2650 v4 (12 Cores) / 20GB DDR4 / 480GB SSD / 1Gbps 20TB - for $ 49 per month - 11%. <br>  VPS (KVM) - E5-2650 v4 (12 Cores) / 20GB DDR4 / 2 x 4TB RAID1 SATA / 1Gbps 20TB - for $ 49 per month - 6%. </blockquote><br>  Although we intuitively imagined that the distribution could be so, we were surprised that it was the redundant version with HDD and RAID1 that caused the least interest.  Perhaps this is explained by the fact that backups need to be done anyway, and a raid in this configuration does not give any performance gain in the case of write operations, although it is strange, in fact, it is a good analogue of a dedicated server with a RAID array, which will and fault tolerant and provide an increase in reading performance.  In general, we adjusted the supply in accordance with this distribution. <br><br>  In reality, the distribution was as follows: <br><br><blockquote>  VPS (KVM) - E5-2650 v4 (6 Cores) l 10GB l 240GB SSD l 1Gbps 10TB 50% (64% survey) <br>  VPS (KVM) - E5-2650 v4 (12 Cores) l 20GB l 480GB SSD l 1Gbps 20TB 35% (11% survey) <br>  VPS (KVM) - E5-2650 v4 (6 Cores) l 10GB l 4TB SATA l 1Gbps 10TB 5% (20% survey) <br>  VPS (KVM) - E5-2650 v4 (12 Cores) l 20GB l 2x4TB SATA l 1Gbps 20TB 10% (6% survey) </blockquote><br>  That, by the way, is more logical.  Although these are still small statistics, a couple of dozen pre-orders that were conducted in the first days of the campaign (until December 1st).  Virtual servers on dedicated HDD drives should be provided today or tomorrow, as there was a delay due to the large partition size in 4TB in the case of Windows installation and our administrators are working to solve the problem so that the automatic installation system will not, God forbid, you also fail it was always convenient to reinstall the OS, including on Windows in 1 click. <br><br>  And yes, this is important, since we provide Winodws for up to six months for FREE, activating a trial period for customers and providing an opportunity to enter their own key afterwards, and this is officially allowed by Microsoft itself.  Although she tries to "push" on their SPLA-partners, so that they do not use the free period.  But we will use the official opportunity as much as possible.  Since it is very important for our business subscribers, who do not want to overpay or pay at all in a crisis, far from unnecessary, but serious money for the operating system, and half a year of ‚Äútest‚Äù is enough for them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff4/684/bbc/ff4684bbc4094db0a823d29549e36a6b.jpg"><br><br>  Since the Habr community is unique, we still would like to hear your opinions about the pros and cons of the proposed solution.  We see them as such: <br><br>  + more reliable, as the iron is new, of the latest generation (v4 at the moment), less risk of hardware problems; <br>  + computational operations take place more efficiently, due to the peculiarities of the architecture of the new E5-2650 v4 processor (a trivial example, if virtuals go up on hardware, where efficient processing of floating point operations is not supported, then the conversion speed of the same video may vary at times, there are essentially you need several times more gigahertz for performing certain operations); <br>  + cost-effectiveness (in most cases, dedicated entry-level servers lose in performance); <br>  + ease of management; <br>  - the impossibility of installing VMware ESXi (the inability to create virtual machines on a virtual machine :)) and some specific operating systems. <br><br>  Well, the promised bonus, to <b>all who leave the order number in the comments, we guarantee the provision of any of the configurations below to the end of December for free</b> (the order must be paid and the payment will be taken into account for the next rental period, however, in the event something happens arrange - we guarantee a refund, regardless of the reasons): <br><br> <a href="http://ua-hosting.company/vds"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/899/83a/02b/89983a02b20940baa6a1a9dd06f2d053.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://ua-hosting.company/vds"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86f/7eb/e42/86f7ebe428ac4a65a04dd19ca3f34ca3.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://ua-hosting.company/vds"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1a/a85/4c6/f1aa854c673d417187dfd7335d0aa788.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://ua-hosting.company/vds"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed7/3d6/660/ed73d66609af4df48ff76e63d81dc5a4.png"></a> <br><br>  For each virtual server with a dedicated drive, you can purchase up to 3 IP addresses and increase traffic at the rate of + $ 15 for each additional 10TB. <br><br>  We would appreciate suggestions and criticism in the comments.  Your feedback is very important to us.  We are listening and hearing you. <br><br>  You can order presented virtual servers with dedicated drives in the Netherlands through our website: <a href="http://ua-hosting.company/vds">http://ua-hosting.company/vds</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317282/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317282/</a></p>
