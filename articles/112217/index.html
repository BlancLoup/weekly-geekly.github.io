      The book was written a year and two months ago, and for this year much of what the book cited as a forecast for the future has become a reality.  This book is not a textbook.  Rather, easy reading, written in complex language.  As an author, I tried to give the reader a reason for reflection, and not to offer answers to questions.  Judging by the reviews of many readers, I did it. <br><br>  And then, the review and official information. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>About the author:</b> <br>  Yaroslav Trofimov, founder and director <a href="http://www.metamarketing.com.ua/">of inspire metamarketing</a> , a specialist in branding and marketing, designer, artistic director. <br><br>  <b>Abstract publisher:</b> <br>  In the book, the author describes his vision of the evolution of the consumer society over the next 10-15 years, reveals promising business models, tools of competition, the dangers and possibilities of the coming information society. <br><br>  The author offers a classification of promising and effective marketing and branding tools for the near future, as well as examines in detail the issue of media evolution within the framework of convergence theory, and how all the described processes will change consumer behavior and business functions. <br>  Deeply explores promising approaches to identifying brands in the conditions of the modern world and the near future: visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile branding and many other new features. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/iderins/" class="user_link">Iderins review</a> :</b> <br><blockquote>  A month ago, in Odessa, I conducted a training on the territory of the inspire.metamarketing branding agency.  In the same place, I brazenly bluffed up and got a copy of this book from Yaroslav.  I must say that at first I took it very skeptical: seemingly thin, about a hundred pages of brochure (4 times thinner than ‚Äúphotos‚Äù), when opening it tries to sprinkle, adorned with sponsors advertising, lost external fields ... Plus my personal acquaintance with the author, he constantly endowed the readable lines with voice, intonation, and manner of presentation of Yaroslav.  But "there is no prophet in his own country."  In short, flipped through, tried to read.  It went with difficulty.  Postponed. <br><br>  But a few weeks later, when I needed to go to Lviv, I took her on the road.  And there, on the road, I literally bite into it.  I am not a branding expert at all.  And this is definitely not my profile.  But it is very close and clear to me all that Yaroslav said about in the pages of the book.  She expressed much and much that I thought about myself.  And that did not occur to me yet. <br><br>  I can not say that the book "changed my life."  But it made me think.  So much so that I decided to act very differently in very many ways.  About work, about plans, about priorities, about the strategy of my business.  The future is near.  It inevitably approaches.  We all do it.  Right now.  Whether we like it or not.  Do we want to hold on to the ‚Äúclear past‚Äù, or boldly go forward, opening up to change.  Our place in the future depends on us now. <br><br>  <b>In short, my subjective summary:</b> <br><br>  It is clear that the book is addressed primarily to marketers and developers of branding systems.  But it will be useful to all those who are engaged in business.  All those who do not think "just now."  All those who ask the question "what will I do after 5, 10, 15 years?". </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112217/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112217/</a></p>
