Our sign-up conversion is from 34% to 80%, depending on the source.  And more than 80% of those who entered - add devices and use the system. <br><br>  More details why so, under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Why was Google originally? </h1><br>  At the very beginning, the project was created as an Android application with an API for accessing the sending of notifications to itself.  The Google account is already embedded in Android, authorization through it allows you to enter in one click, without entering a login or password. <br><br>  Next, we made support for the Google Chrome browser.  It also uses cloud sync and is embedded in many Google accounts.

      Then we began to expand in the direction of the telegraph and the web-push, which, in general, can work in other browsers.  We also have an iOS application, why is Google authorization there? <br><br><h1>  Examples of other projects </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a6/fe7/ab1/8a6fe7ab11469355673c404956759b5b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Everyone remembers the mailbox?  It is considered one of the most convenient mail clients.  He initially supported only Google-mail, and now also supports iCloud.  However, even when there was only Google Mail, not many people were against this. <br><br>  The fact is that almost everyone has Google mail.  It is reliable, there is no spam, it works quickly and has many additional functions. <br><br>  Even as an example, you can take a kickstarter, they work, in fact, in the US market and Facebook is spread there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/acc/1b1/470/acc1b1470b88842e52eae63582c4d4ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In this case, too, there was a choice in favor of one solution, and not a heap of buttons for various social networks. <br><br><h1>  The situation in Russia and the world, statistics. </h1><br>  I'll take the slides <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/remarkableru/ss-28008950">from here.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/517/7a3/b0f/5177a3b0f50451294594ac07f1355808.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We draw attention to the share of YouTube, which in 2013 (data is old, but still) has a share, like OK and comparable to VK, <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a5/526/6b8/9a55266b8a7e54063f6374668944ae2d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  An indicative slide about the share in the world - the share of Google+ and Youtube is higher than that of Twitter, <br><br>  Another significant data article - <a href="http://www.vitki.org/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%2520%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%2520%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D1%258B%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%2520Google.html">Why Yandex loses Google</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6a/863/b01/e6a863b01a67bd62109ba900c9b7f1e6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Minute statistics in Russia.

You have probably heard that we are reaching 80% conversion for a certain audience.  Entry with one button without registration and additional actions allows you to achieve these numbers. <br><br>  Additional buttons of social networks lead to confusion.  We now sometimes write with problems that they do not have notifications.  It turns out that they logged on to different accounts on the computer and phone.  That is, they have several Google accounts. <br><br>  Imagine what will happen if we have a login through Twitter, VK, Facebook and Google.  People will go through the tablet via VK, on ‚Äã‚Äãthe phone via Google, on the computer via Twitter.  Begin porridge and chaos.  A bunch of social network buttons, everything is confused, we will start to lose a large share of the audience. <br><br>  No longer means better!  We have many who do not have a Google account, without any extra words do it, because  they even had plans for it, for example, they wanted to comment on something on YouTube, or start a secure mail from Google.  People know this and they just work with it. <br><br><h1>  Rusbase </h1><br>  Strange, but we recently learned about their site.  We offered to create a channel and they agreed. <br>  The channel is available at <a href="https://pushall.ru/rusbase">https://pushall.ru/rusbase</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/34a/b1a/262/34ab1a262f378cc458feebe997da3d65.jpg" alt="image"><br>  You can receive notifications about new articles on the site, as well as you can set up filters and receive notifications on topics of interest to you. <br><br>  By the way, we already have about 7200 users, and now 2 million notifications will be sent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c82/7ab/ab7/c827abab7c154b488bac4b9bbf79d6f3.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268267/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268267/</a></p>
