All the characters in it are fictional, and any similarity is just a coincidence, which may not be accidental, but it should definitely make you smile, and in some cases will help to visually show your colleagues and partners what is happening in the world of data centers. <br><br>  I can only say for sure that the action takes place in our big and deeply beloved, but far from unequivocal country, with all its big cockroaches. <br><br>  I would like to bring to your attention a series of illustrations from the life of data center employees and customers, and invite you to voice the characters and the situations in which they constantly fall.  Restricting on this would not be entirely correct, and all those who are haunted by their own stories from the life of a data center can send them to me by mail.  The best of them will be necessarily illustrated.

      I will introduce you to our regular heroes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Vasilich, the power engineer on duty.</b> <br>  A man of 35-40, secondary technical education, a master of his craft, knows the answers to everything, even the not yet spoken out loud, questions about electrical equipment.  When asked whether there is free power in a given rack, the answer is always confident: ‚ÄúNO‚Äù, even if the rack is absolutely empty, and if you ask again a couple of times the power can be found.  His super-executiveness leads to the fact that sometimes his colleagues and the leadership of the deepest respect for him go to turn the nuts themselves - why bother with such trifles about such a person.  Vasilich is an excellent tutor: the wisdom of the data center is transferred to the younger generation, who, in his opinion, only needs to drink beer and put a screwdriver in the wrong place.  A big fan of fishing and football, and the fat channels in the data center allow you to watch all the interesting matches without leaving the workplace, and even with a bottle of always cool beer from the tray under the raised floor. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/83b/1bb/7f9/83b1bb7f9db3f347919ae68d67afe2f5.png"><br><br>  <b>Semyon, technical support engineer.</b> <br>  A third-year student of a prestigious technical university, dreams of building his own ultra-modern data center according to the TIER V standard. On this occasion, he has his own concept, which he keeps secret and never tells anyone, well, except after a glass or two fellow students.  In short, it‚Äôs like this: ‚ÄúThe data center is located in a vertical shaft deep underground, the containment area is in a vacuum, and the server equipment is in special slots, the megabled chassis is mounted by robotic arms.‚Äù <br><br>  Sport is alien to Semen, but at the same time he tries to lead a healthy lifestyle, he tried a lot of diets, including starvation, sometimes not even at will.  Permanent non-stop technical support engineer of the data center.  Periodically it breaks at night: either play another online RPG game, or continue to implement a brilliant idea that started five years ago that will conquer the whole world. <br><br>  With the money saved over the year of work and dieting, he bought himself an iPhone 4, after which he became an avid fan of Apple.  For iPhone 5 and Ipad mini is ready for a lot. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed1/0d9/4de/ed10d94debea9ddab7cf9bc47c543dad.png"><br><br>  <b>Oleg, one of the oldest and favorite customers.</b> <br>  Oleg's career evolved rapidly: by the age of 27, he became the head of the IT department of one of the largest, one might say, country-forming enterprises.  Despite such rapid growth and impressive social status, he prefers to periodically visit the data center himself and check the work of not only his equipment, but also the data center operation services.  The person is creative, with a great sense of humor, which allows him to endure enough all the tricks of Vasilich and Semyon.  Sometimes it rolls on him, and he wants to strangle any of them, but quickly leaves and tries to find options that would nullify all the efforts and flight of fancy of the staff on duty. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5ce/e01/716/5cee017167f94abd5d9fb6cfff340a3e.png"><br><br>  <b>Illustration number 1</b> <br><br>  The situation is banal to disgrace.  There are several freight elevators in the data center for lifting equipment, but, as always, at the moment when the most expensive and large equipment is brought, which you need to install blood from the nose today, elevators break down, suddenly become maintenance, etc. Our heroes have fallen into such a simple situation.  I suggest everyone to voice their dialogue.  The best version will be used in the final version of the illustration. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c19/f0c/209/c19f0c20953ba1ef546a01ae3659155e.png"></div><br><br>  Send your stories to me at: ETsodikov@yandex.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163399/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163399/</a></p>
