  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to become a rich IT specialist - another thought</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I read articles by respected authors, and decided to write something from myself.  What made me like that?  I do not know, rather the desire to share my experience and some specific examples from life. <br>  So what else, except for assets, liabilities and everything already described? <br><br>  Yes, everything that the author of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/152995/">first article</a> writes is correct.  It immediately becomes clear that the author associates himself with Petya, and tries to be like him, in fact describes himself ideally.  But what is missing in this wonderful story? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first thing you really want to understand when reading is the <b>goals of</b> young people.  Indeed, in order to become a rich man, first of all, it is necessary to set this goal in front of you.  And by the way, as far as this goal is ambitious, in the first place, the size of the future "millions" depends. <br>  Unfortunately, at a young age, many people cannot formulate the correct goal for themselves, are in constant search, and here <b>luck is</b> already included. <br>  Enough to get to the right school, university, get the environment of thinking people, and luck gets closer.  After studying, or during, you need to join the stream of practice, where a person can see how successful people work, form ideals for themselves, and this will greatly bring good luck. <br>  But <b>success is</b> already highly dependent on the person himself, as he will use what was described earlier. <br><br>  The author of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/153233/">second article</a> successfully noted that sometimes it is just necessary to use some tools to attract other people.  In his example, this is a car that he bought on credit, in order to look solid before the same customers.  Well, so is a person by his nature that ‚Äúmeets on clothes‚Äù, and therefore ‚ÄúPonte‚Äù will be sold for a long time.

      I will not use accounting terminology (just a little bit), since in the previous articles the ideas have been revealed quite fully, I will give only a few examples from my own life. <br><br>  At the age of 17, finishing school, I got a job at a company that was the first Internet provider in our country, and at that time was a fairly serious IT company.  Unfortunately, the goals that stood just before this were not destined to come true for health reasons, when I practically did not enter SP BSTU for a specialty that interested me (FTC), I just could not go there.  And then I really wanted to get <b>knowledge</b> , this is the main asset! <br>  But what were the goals of getting a job, even before leaving school then?  First of all, the goal to make a lot of money, and even millions, was not.  Getting a good education in my own country seemed to me very dim, and I decided to go a different way.  I did get a higher education (I will not say what is good, but still in my own country), but the truth is in economics, more so that it is, but now is not about that. <br><br>  Since from childhood, computers were used to God, and God gave such an opportunity, I understood them quite well, despite the fact that the dashing nineties were raging outside. <br>  It‚Äôs all a matter of luck more when, when I was in 6th or 7th grade (I don‚Äôt remember, honestly) I got into the CPC for computer science, instead of the auto industry, where the majority were.  Immediately ZX-Spectrum, then successfully lucky when at work my father had the opportunity to "touch" IBM. <br>  In general, at school, I, like many here, was a participant (sometimes even the winner) of many olympiads, because, as I believe, I did not sit and play from morning to night, but I did. <br>  By the way, when I read an article here (I can‚Äôt find a link) about how the author developed his program for teaching schoolchildren, and their success, tears came to his eyes.  After all, a good developer, a creator, could grow out of me if I had the opportunity to learn from such teachers.  And it was not and what happened?  Huckster?  :) <br><br>  So, returning to the goals, first of all I had a goal, by all means to get knowledge in practice.  After a few months of work, I grew up from an incomprehensible assistant engineer to the head of the technical department.  For me, boy of 17 years, it was the height of dreams.  Besides the fact that at work was someone to learn from experience, I began to grow into <b>acquaintances</b> , <b>connections</b> .  The income level has grown significantly, plus there were some side jobs that started to bring very good money for that time.  So somewhere at that moment the goal to make more money began to take shape in order to realize its ambitions, needs, etc. <br>  But that's not all.  Then luck came in, which helped move to another, more solid company, but the truth is no longer working in the field of IT.  And it helped greatly gaining experience in a fairly narrow specialization related to automation.  I think, continuing to work in IT-companies, I would never have received such experience.  You can be a very serious consultant, architect, etc., but having no idea how a customer‚Äôs business works from the inside, it‚Äôs very hard to be a truly valuable specialist. <br>  Further, I almost inherited another, even larger company.  So, by the age of 22, he was already working as an IT department director at a very large company.  What can I say about what my life was more like?  On the life of Vasya or Petit?  I think none of them.  I had to work for months without days off, and for years without holidays.  At the same time, I had to spend at night at work, and at home in my dreams I had dreams of working tasks, and by the way there were even solutions!  Hellish work, maybe.  On, this is one of the indisputable details in achieving success!  The only question is, what are your goals? <br><br>  While still working in the field of the company described above, I began to think about creating my own small company that would concentrate on a narrow specialization which I know would provide my services to a wider range of companies.  Fortunately, the owner, and he is the boss of the company for which I worked, was and is quite an intelligent and successful businessman, he understood me and did not dissuade me.  True, I had another year after my application to work, to assemble a team, to leave a man behind me, but this not only did not prevent me, but also helped to stay in good relations with the former boss.  Now we are friends, and this friendship helps me a lot.  What is it?  Luck?  By the way, friends are one of the powerful assets! <br>  In addition, a year earlier I started a family.  I think this is one of the important factors for success, since it was my family that taught me to earn little money, it is more important to save them!  By the way, I consider the family one of the most important assets in life, like health and knowledge.  You understand this with age.  I know people who have a lot of money, but no family, and they would be ready to give all this money in return, and late ... Well, let's go on. <br><br>  The first 2-3 years of work already own company went with a big creak.  The most important thing that I consider correct at that moment is that I did not get into debt.  Start-up capital was some, but it was not big.  Yes, there was no money for anything.  Neither the family nor the salary of a few employees.  It was necessary even at some stage to sell the car (very good by the way), and the proceeds to invest to maintain pants in the company.  It was necessary to tighten the straps, to reduce the costs to which I was already accustomed, working ‚Äúfor my uncle‚Äù.  What do you think?  I regretted leaving with a stable and quite good income?  Not!  It was not up to these thoughts, it was necessary to work! <br>  The growth of the company's assets in the first 3 years was 100% per year!  Little or a lot depends on the start-up capital, I think in our case everything was very successful. <br><br>  So, slowly but surely, the situation began to improve, and our company met the crisis of 2008‚Äì2009 without loss, and even with a profit.  Of course, there was no 100% capital gain, but none the less.  It rather worked luck. <br>  By the way, I would like to emphasize this fact.  Repeatedly faced with the situation when it was necessary to implement new directions, and it would seem, nothing complicated and costly, everything can be started in a period of 2-3 months, and projects stretched for a year or more.  And believe me, nothing can be done about it!  It seems that they were supposed to "ripen"!  After that, the development of these areas was much more successful. <br>  Here is another very important note.  thanks to which I did not lose what I started from the very beginning - you can never ever get into someone else's pocket!  Never spend the money until the project is completed at least 90%.  Otherwise, it can fail, due to which it will be very difficult to correct the situation!  I know many talented people who have sinned and continue to sin with this, and <b>fate</b> does with them what they deserve. <br>  Now I have achieved the goals that I set for myself then.  Yes, it is possible to increase the turnover a year by another 2 times, and the staff is still 3, but this is enough for me.  I do not want to give up the rest 1-2 times a year in Thailand, 1-2 times in Bali and another 1-2 times in Europe.  I think I did a good job in my teenage years.  I have everything for a normal life, including liabilities for myself.  Yes, without them?  Why money, if they only buy assets?  Now I am formulating new goals based on new realities, and this will be a new motivation, a new asset. <br><br>  By the way, my opinion about such things as a car, which is cheaper and requires costs, household items, rest and so on.  Repeatedly, I came across situations where you just need to pamper yourself with something!  He was depressed several times, called it a ‚Äúblack‚Äù stripe, when nothing worked out, and everything fell off.  So, the recipe for getting out of the peak for me was the acquisition of something that maybe I wanted for a long time, but ‚Äúthe toad crushed,‚Äù or there was not enough money!  And so, after this wonderful moment of acquiring it, everything was decided by itself and ‚Äúresolved‚Äù.  Here, I think, is a matter of <b>mood</b> .  You should always raise it yourself (control it so that it does not fall). <br><br>  Individually, you probably will not be able to become a millionaire, and you will have to use the concept of ‚Äúmotivation‚Äù, not only to subordinates and employees, but first and foremost to yourself. <br><br>  About managing your time: yes, if you set yourself to earn seriously big money, be prepared for the fact that you will work like Papa Carlo, and then you cannot go anywhere without such things as Time Management, and similar goodies.  But here, in my opinion, saving on checking emails and telephone conversations is unlikely to help.  Without operational information it will only be worse, but it‚Äôs not worth bothering too.  By the way, I often want to drown my phone, and I think this is normal. <br><br>  As for the social.  networks, so I don‚Äôt understand them at all, unless of course we consider Habr as a social.  network.  The same with online games and their ilk.  Forget about them.  If they raise your spirits, play about 10 minutes (per month). <br><br>  What conclusions can be drawn from what I wrote here?  Well, then you decide.  I just wanted to say that in addition to undoubtedly the right things, which were written by respected authors of previous posts, there are also those that I have tried to remind. <br>  I would be glad if someone will find my story interesting, or even better, if it helps to structure my life plans. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153421/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153421/</a></p>
