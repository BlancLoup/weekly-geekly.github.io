      <b>Server processors</b> <br>  Server processors are designed primarily to provide high reliability.  They test such processors under stressful conditions at high temperatures and high computational loads.  They can operate at very high frequencies, providing high-quality processing of massive data. <br><br>  <b>What is the difference between server processors and desktop processors?</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <i>High quality control</i> .  Server processors go through all kinds of testing under the most severe conditions.  As an analogue, you can give the following example: the engine of a passenger plane requires more thorough testing than the engine of a car.  Undoubtedly, the risk of aircraft engine malfunction is higher. <br><br></li><li>  <i>Reliability</i>  Server processors are fault tolerant.  In a critical situation, servers can avoid shutting down or rebooting (with 2 processor configurations).  They are designed to work non-stop 24/7.  Desktop options are more designed for "everyday" multitasking. <br><br></li><li>  <i>The presence of self-correcting system</i> .  Server CPUs have an algorithm for correcting memory errors that may affect equipment stability.  This technology is called ‚Äúerror checking and correction‚Äù (ECC). </li></ul><br>  We now turn directly to the choice of processor. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#016f81">Main processor selection criteria</font> </h2><br>  <b>¬ªKernels</b> <br>  Less than ten years ago, all processors were released with one core.  Now single-core processors have become an exception due to the widespread prevalence of multi-core processors.  Recently, even software is developed in such a way that applications can use multi-core technology.  There are many options to choose from - from 2 to 22 cores. <br><br>  When the processors were launched on one core, it was fully responsible for processing the data that was transferred to the processor.  The more cores are built into the CPU, the more they are able to distribute its tasks.  This makes the processor faster and more efficient.  It is very important to understand that the processor is responsible only for the execution of tasks, as is the software that runs on it.  All the core work is done by the kernels.  However, it should be borne in mind that if for the correct operation of applications 3 cores of 8 are used, then 5 cores remain untapped.  <b>To minimize costs, it is worth matching system requirements with the number of cores</b> . <br><br>  <b>¬ªCash</b> <br>  Processor cache can be compared with computer memory.  In fact, this is a small amount of very fast memory that is used for temporary storage of data.  This allows the computer to very quickly recover files that are in the processor's cache.  The larger the cache, the faster the processor performs the tasks assigned to it. <br><br>  <b>Socket</b> <br>  Socket compatibility is the top priority when choosing a processor.  A socket is a means of communication between the motherboard and the CPU.  If you have already bought a motherboard, check that the installed processor is compatible with its socket.  Conversely, buying processors separately, check compatibility with the motherboard.  This can be useful for further upgrade. <br><br>  <b>¬ªGraphics Processor (GPU)</b> <br>  Many modern processors have embedded graphics processors that perform calculations related to graphics.  If the processor does not have a built-in GPU, the server will still be able to display graphics (if a separate video card is installed or the motherboard allows you to run the video).  However, for the operation of software and applications intensively loaded with graphics, a CPU with an integrated GPU will work much more efficiently. <br><br>  <b>¬ªFrequency</b> <br>  The frequency of the CPU, measured in Hertz, is the speed at which it operates.  It used to be like this: high frequency = better performance.  This formula is no longer valid.  In some cases, a low-frequency CPU may actually work better than a high-frequency processor.  This is affected by the processor architecture.  On a par with the frequency it is very important to pay attention to the number of processor commands executed per cycle.  Although the frequency is still an important indicator of processor speed, now this is not the key point affecting the real CPU speed. <br><br>  <b>¬ªThe amount of heat output (TDP)</b> <br>  Processors generate heat.  The amount of heat dissipation assigned to the processor explains how much heat the processor can generate.  This will directly affect the type of cooling required by the CPU.  If the processor is delivered without a cooling system, or this system is not used, it is necessary to think over the cooling system for the correct operation of the server.  Overheating is the main danger for server components. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c4/e63/22b/9c4e6322b6925f7e442fda189848931f.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#016f81">Which specification is suitable for your company?</font> </h2><br>  During the selection of the processor, some criteria will be more important than others.  In order to facilitate the task of choosing a processor, we have prepared typical solutions depending on the size of your company. <br><br>  <b>Small company:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  <i>The cores</i> .  For most tasks, a server with a 4-core processor is suitable.  If you are faced with more demanding tasks - it is necessary to work with graphic design, find out how many cores are needed for a particular software.  If you need 8 cores, then it is best to invest money immediately in a server based on 8-core processors. <br><br></li><li>  <i>Memory</i> .  The amount of memory that the server supports can also play a role.  The motherboard and the type of operating system will help determine the required volume. <br><br></li><li>  <i>Frequency</i>  The software you plan to work with will affect the speed of the CPU.  For example, continuous use of Adobe CS 6 will require a processor with a speed of at least 2 GHz. <br></li></ol><br>  <b>Medium-sized companies</b> <br><br><ol><li>  <i>Price</i>  Most medium-sized companies must adhere to the established budget when it comes to buying equipment.  Price relative to processor performance can be a key factor. <br><br></li><li>  <i>Multithreading</i>  When choosing a server processor, be sure to pay attention to Hyper-Threading technology.  This technology provides a more efficient use of processor resources, allowing you to run multiple threads on each core and increases the throughput of the processors, improving the overall performance of multi-threaded applications. <br></li></ol><br>  <b>Corporate customers</b> <br><br><ol><li> <i>The cores</i> .  When choosing a CPU, consider the number of cores.  It is necessary to focus on the technical requirements of applications.  For example, if an 8-core processor is installed, but only 4 of them are needed for an application, then there is no point in overpaying.  Size does not always matter. <br><br></li><li>  <i>Frequency</i>  Here, too, it is worth focusing on software - some companies have enough 2 GHz, while others lack 4 GHz. <br><br></li><li>  <i>Tdp</i>  Check this figure before purchasing processors.  Then you will be sure that the cooling system will cope with the release of heat. </li></ol><br><h2>  <font color="#016f81">Does it make sense to overpay for performance?</font> </h2><br>  We made a comparative list of processors, relatively similar in characteristics, and indicated prices for servers, on board which the following CPU models are installed (prices are taken on Yandex.Market and <a href="http://squadra-group.com/">Squadra Group</a> from <a href="http://squadra-group.com/">05.23.2016</a> ): <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Squadra Group Processors</b> <br></td><td>  <b>CPU Benchmark</b> <br></td><td>  <b>Price per server, ‚ÇΩ</b> <br></td><td>  <b>New processors</b> <br></td><td>  <b>CPU Benchmark</b> <br></td><td>  <b>Price per server, ‚ÇΩ</b> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Intel Xeon E5530 <br>  (4 Core, 8M Cache, 2.40 GHz) <br></td><td>  4621 <br></td><td>  18,000 <br></td><td>  Intel Core i5-2300 <br>  (4 Core, 6M Cache, up to 3.10 GHz) <br></td><td>  5283 <br></td><td>  78,000 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Intel Xeon E5620 <br>  (4 Core, 12M Cache, 2.40 GHz) <br></td><td>  4903 <br></td><td>  21,800 <br></td><td>  Intel Core i7-870 <br>  (4 Core, 8M Cache, 2.93 GHz) <br></td><td>  5487 <br></td><td>  85,000 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://squadra-group.com/servers/supermicro/supermicro-6016t-uf-x8dtuf">Intel Xeon E5645</a> <br>  (6 Core, 12M Cache, 2.40 GHz) <br></td><td>  6533 <br></td><td>  39,400 <br></td><td>  Intel Xeon E3-1225 v3 <br>  (4 Core, 8M Cache, 3.20 GHz) <br></td><td>  7005 <br></td><td>  124 300 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Intel Xeon X5650 <br>  (6 Core, 12M Cache, 2.66 GHz) <br></td><td>  7601 <br></td><td>  45 400 <br></td><td>  Intel Xeon E5-2620 v2 <br>  (6 Core, 15M Cache, 2.10 GHz) <br></td><td>  8689 <br></td><td>  195,000 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://squadra-group.com/servers/supermicro/supermicro-6017r-ntf-x9drw">Intel Xeon E5-2670 v1</a> <br>  (8 Core, 20M Cache, 2.60 GHz) <br></td><td>  12497 <br></td><td>  77 900 <br></td><td>  Intel Xeon E5-2640 v3 <br>  (8 Core, 20M Cache, 2.60 GHz) <br></td><td>  14055 <br></td><td>  375,000 <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  This is a visual diagram of the ratio of processor performance and prices for used and new servers: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d81/2d9/2bb/d812d92bbc482b21d24ade422332fd69.png"></div><br>  Obviously, the prices for new servers are significantly different from the used ones, although the performance of processors is about the same. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#016f81">Conclusion</font> </h2><br>  So, when choosing a processor, determine the following things for yourself: <br><br><ol><li>  The purpose of using the server. </li><li>  Technical characteristics of the applications for which the server will be intended. </li><li>  Compatibility with other components (memory, OS, etc.). </li><li>  Company size </li><li>  Price </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301590/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301590/</a></p>
