  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The disaster in Minneapolis has tested the strength of the city's WiFi network</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Minneapolis Municipal WiFi network, which covers 25% of the city‚Äôs territory, has undergone its first serious strength test.  As you know, last week there was a man-made disaster: a huge bridge collapsed in the Mississippi River along with fifty cars.  The peaceful state of Minnesota has not seen such a massive death since the destruction of local Indians. <br><br>  Minneapolis is one of the cities where the citywide WiFi network is deployed.  After the disaster, this network was actively used by rescuers and the police.  For the first time in the world, such a system has been tested in real conditions of mass rescue operations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/191/f7f/262/191f7f262f71614d69e1de95c9ce9c30.jpg" width="450" height="277" alt="Destroyed bridge across the Mississippi River" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  How she handled the task, <a href="http://news.com.com/Citywide%2BWi-Fi%2Bnetwork%2Bput%2Bto%2Btest%2Bin%2BMinneapolis/2100-7351_3-6201561.html">says</a> Joe Caldwell, executive director of <a href="http://www.usiwireless.com/">USI Wireless</a> , the contractor for this project.  By order of the city authorities, they began to deploy the network in April, and by the end of June managed to cover about 47 km <sup>2</sup> , a quarter of the urban area.  Most of the coverage was in the center, just next to the bridge.

      As soon as the tragedy struck, USI Wireless immediately opened the city network for free public access.  Additional hot spots with a total bandwidth of 12 Mbit / s were installed near the disaster area.  Since cellular communication in the area was cut down due to congestion within 30 minutes after the disaster, it was WiFi that became the only channel through which smartphone owners could send at least some message. <br><br>  That evening, the number of WiFi users increased from the standard 1,000 people to 6,000. Among them were rescuers and police officers who were able to quickly exchange terrain maps, photos and other digital information. <br><br>  The USI Wireless company decided to take advantage of the situation in order to install WiFi cameras, which had long been purchased by the city and were waiting for their time to be installed.  Now they were attached along the coast of the river, so that a live picture from the scene of the tragedy was transmitted to the command center of the rescue operation all the time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13040/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13040/</a></p>
