  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sony Bloggie Camera Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About a month ago <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/82141/">I read here</a> that Sony Bloggie cameras were on sale, which allow you to shoot video 360 degrees.  After watching the video in the post, I immediately found it in the online store sonystyle.com and ordered it.  Let me present my short review of this product.  To compare the characteristics, I used a <a href="http://www.techhome.ru/Document/Articles/32654">Toshiba Camileo P-30</a> camera with similar properties, which has been with me for six months. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ce8/c45/b11/ce8c45b119d3e97fd0cef432b5fe40ed.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Unpacking</b>

    <iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/9752901&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi6ogKUILRSNZDv8NVuvxvaDH9HGQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Sony Bloggie unpacking" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the box is the camera itself, the battery, the wires for connecting to a Tulip TV on one side and Sony‚Äôs own connector on the other.  Also, a memory stick on 4Gb and the reason for which I bought all this design - a nozzle for shooting panoramic video.  There is no charger, because  The camera is charged via the built-in USB connector. <br><br>  The first conclusion that can be made is that the camera that removes HD-video does not have an HDMI connector, that is, it is impossible to transfer a picture directly from it in HD quality, which, in my opinion, is rather strange.  Lack of a charger and an integrated connector is a plus, although if you have a stationary computer, it can be a problem to plug in the camera for charging, because  the connector does not imply any kind of rotation and it may happen that the camera will touch the wires or protruding parts in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãUSB sockets on the computer case.  It connects to my laptop without any problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b15/48c/b81/b1548cb814458ca9821f0356a8cbee66.jpg"><br><br>  Is that the USB connectors in it are located so that when a camera is connected it is very inconvenient to print - you touch it all the time. <br><br>  <b>The quality of shooting.</b> <br><br>  I went out into the yard and walked with a camera to the store for cigarettes: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xtJ1hrcLYxQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh6ZKGc09_HA7dkna8qt9uipGKqag" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  For me, a few strange colors.  It was light outside, the snow was white, the sun was shining.  At the shooting, everything turned out somehow gray and dimly lit.  It is possible that this can be corrected by settings, but here it is right away - this is how it removes it.  Regarding the quality of shooting - this is quite decent HD, there is nothing to criticize. <br><br>  If interested, then you can see a comparative shooting of Toshiba Camileo P-30 vs.  Sony Bloggie: <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/9752979&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjwP1iwSfc6A0LYutB7hqNTDRFESQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Sony Bloggie vs. Toshiba Camileo P-30" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In terms of quality, it is practically the same, but it seems to me that Camileo has more juicy colors.  The main inconvenience when shooting, in my opinion, is that it is more physiological to hold the camera as shown in the photo on the right. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/649/d86/90e/649d8690ec6cc7397acf4668efcda157.jpg"><br><br>  I didn‚Äôt like the fact that we had to constantly control the position of the hand and direct the bent brush to the subject, unlike the standard version, when the lens is an extension of the hand and you can control the camera without looking at the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/122/052/76b/12205276b207ae6b9e1ad16574355579.jpg"><br><br>  Optics on the cameras is completely different.  So different that it is even surprising how, with such a tiny lens, the Japanese brothers squeeze the quality FullHD 1920 * 1080. <br><br>  <b>Panoramic (spherical) video.</b> <br><br>  Actually, because of what I bought this camera, so it is because of the possibility of "making a video like in Haiti."  Stripped off.  The result obtained seemed to me below any criticism.  <a href="http://www.tupayapizda.ru/video/index.html">See for yourself</a> (link opens in a new window): <br><br> <a href="http://www.tupayapizda.ru/video/index.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/015/6cb/d56/0156cbd56921c9ff48319b9ccd833986.jpg" alt="1267608847-clip-23kb"></a> <br><br>  This is EVERYTHING the camera can do.  Here in this quality on the street, the room is completely rotten.  It is suitable, of course, for the device store DVR, but no more. <br><br>  <b>Correspondence with Sony support.</b> <br><br>  I was so impressed by this shooting that I wrote a letter to tech support asking me to explain how on their stand everything changes abruptly right on-line and it turns out a high-quality picture, but in reality there is no such thing.  The shot spherical video cannot even be put on the web by any means.  There is no software other than a converter for local viewing. <br><br>  In response I received this letter, I quote: <br><br>  "... Unfortunately, this is the standard quality of panoramic video for a device with such parameters and characteristics ... <br>  ... The issue of video support with panning on blogs and video services is completely dependent on the owners of the respective services.  With the growing popularity of panoramic video among bloggers, we can expect the introduction of such support on popular video services ... <br>  ... We are sorry that the camera did not meet your expectations. <br>  ... In turn, we recommend that in the future, when choosing a product, it is more critical to refer to reporting clips that demonstrate not the result of the shooting, but a demonstration of the result on the exhibition screen.  Accurately determine the quality of video on such videos is impossible. <br>  Please also note that the <b>MHS-PM5K is a special budget compact device optimized not for high-quality amateur video filming (like high-resolution Handycam video cameras with powerful optics and arrays), but for real-time shooting of events</b> in the format that is most compatible with supported video services and Internet photo hosting sites.  Actually, the device is called the HD Snap Camera (in the sense of a camera for quick and easy shooting in high resolution, or more simply, ‚Äúvideo receiver‚Äù) .... " <br><br>  This is somewhat surprising in terms of what is written on the <a href="http://www.sony.ru/product/dph-mobile-hd-snap-camera/mhs-pm5k">camera description</a> page <a href="http://www.sony.ru/product/dph-mobile-hd-snap-camera/mhs-pm5k">on the Sony website</a> . <br><br>  <b>Summary.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8b9/809/cce/8b9809cce98ebe20faa438e8ea518397.jpg"><br><br>  From the aggregate of data, it can be said that there are now a significant number of cameras on the market that allow you to shoot video in FullHD, with a more convenient design and a comparable price and size.  Engineers should work on ergonomics, and marketers - on the truthfulness of descriptions.  The only difference of this camera, because of which it is worth buying, is implemented in such a way that it would be better if it did not exist at all. <br><br>  The final assessment: "completely disappointed, I will not advise anyone." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86160/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86160/</a></p>
