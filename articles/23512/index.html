      I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world.  I never graduated from college.  Truth has been told  I want to tell you my life.  That's it.  No big deal.  Just three stories. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first story is about connecting the dots. <br>  I’ve gotten out of school for six months, but then I’ve been quit.  So why did I drop out? <br>  It started before I was born.  It was a graduation student.  It is a fact that she felt very strongly.  Except that when I’ve been popping out, they really wanted a girl.  So my parents, who were on the list, asked: “We have an unexpected baby boy;  Do you want him? ”They said:“ Of course. ”It was never graduated from high school.  She refused to sign.  She only relented a few months later when she promised that I would go to college. <br>  And 17 years later I did go to college.  But it wasn’t been working for my college tuition.  After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.  Help me figure it out.  I have been spending their money.  So I’ve been OK to work out.  It was pretty scary.  It was interesting. <br>  It wasn't all romantic.  I’m not sure if I’ve been in the middle of a room. meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple.  I loved it.  I’ve gotten stumbled into the price after my curiosity and intuition.  Let me give you one example: <br>  Reed College at that time in the country.  Throughout the campus, every beautiful poster, label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed.  Because I’ve been dropped out, I’ve gotten out.  I learned about the serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space.  Found it fascinating. <br>  Even had a little hope for any practical application in my life.  But ten years later, we’ve been designing the computer.  And we designed it all into the Mac.  It was a computer typography.  If I never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.  And since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s not possible.  If I’ve never been dropped out, I’m not allowed to get out.  I was in college.  But it was very clear looking backwards ten years later. <br>  Again, you cant forward;  you can only connect them looking backwards.  So you will connect in your future.  You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.  This is what I’ve made in my life. <br>  My second story is about love and loss. <br>  I was lucky - I found what I loved to do.  I was 20. I worked on a garage for a couple of years.  I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.  How can you get fired from a company you started?  Well, so far as it went.  But then our visions of diverge and eventually we had a falling out.  When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him.  So at 30 I was out.  And very publicly out.  It was devastating. <br>  I really didn't know.  I felt that I had been dropped to me.  I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.  I was thought to be running away from the valley.  But I still loved what I did.  Apple had not changed that one bit.  I had been rejected, but I was still in love.  And so I decided to start over. <br>  But it turned out that it wasn’t happened to me.  It will be possible to make sure that it is again, less sure about everything.  It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. <br>  It is a woman who has become my wife.  It’s a funky way to make it.  I’ve come back to the world of Apple’s current renaissance.  And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together. <br>  I'm pretty sure I hadn't been fired from Apple.  It was awful tasting medicine.  Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick.  Don't lose faith.  I was wondering what I loved.  You've got to find what you love.  It is for your lovers.  It is a great work.  What are you doing?  If you haven't found it yet, keep looking.  Don't settle.  You can find it.  And it’s like  So keep looking until you find it.  Don't settle. <br>  My third story is about death. <br>  When I’m 17, I’m reading something like that: “If you’re there, you’ve certainly been right.” past 33 years, I’m about to say today? ” I know I need to change something. <br>  Remembering the most important tool in life.  It’s all that you’ve left behind.  I’m thinking about what you’re losing.  You are already naked.  Follow your heart. <br>  About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer.  I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed on my pancreas.  I didn't even know what a pancreas was.  It is incurable to live.  My doctor advised me to go to my office.  You haven’t been around for a few months.  It will be as easy as possible for your family.  It means to say your goodbyes. <br>  I lived with that diagnosis all day.  I’ve had a biopsy, where I’m thirst for it.  It has been noted that it was not a problem.  I had the surgery and I'm fine now. <br>  I get there for a few more decades.  Having lived through it, it’s a bit more true: <br>  No one wants to die.  Don't want to die there.  And yet death is the destination.  No one has ever escaped it.  And it’s because there’s no need for it.  It is Life's change agent.  It clears out the old way.  It is not a long time for you to be cleared away.  Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true. <br>  Your life is limited.  Don't be trapped by dogma -  Do not make noise of others.  And most importantly, have your courage to follow your heart and intuition.  They want to become.  Everything else is secondary. <br>  When I was young, I was young, there was one of the bibles of my generation.  It was created not only by the world.  It was made with a typewriter, scissors, and polaroid cameras.  It was a kind of Google’s 35-year paper before it was ideal. <br>  It is a matter of course, they’ve put out a final issue.  It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.  If you were so adventurous.  Beneath it were the words: “Stay Hungry.  Stay Foolish. ”It was their farewell message.  Stay Hungry.  Stay Foolish.  And I have always wanted that for myself.  And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you. <br>  Stay Hungry.  Stay Foolish. <br>  Thank you all very much. <br><br>  <b>Transfer:</b> <br>  It is a great honor for me to be with you today to present the diplomas of one of the best universities in the world.  I did not graduate from institutions.  Today I want to tell you three stories from my life.  And that's all.  Nothing big.  Just three stories. <br>  The first story is about connecting points. <br>  I quit Reed College after the first 6 months of training, but I stayed there as a “guest” for about 18 months, until I finally left.  Why did I leave school? <br>  It all started before I was born.  My biological mother was a young, unmarried graduate student and decided to give me up for adoption.  She insisted that I was adopted by people with higher education, so I was destined to be adopted by a lawyer and his wife.  True, a minute before I got out into the world, they decided that they wanted a girl.  Therefore, they got a call at night and asked: “Suddenly a boy was born.  Do you want it? ”.  They said, "Of course."  Then my biological mother learned that my foster mother was not a college graduate, and my father had never been a high school graduate.  She refused to sign the adoption papers.  And only a few months later, I still gave up when my parents promised her that I would definitely go to college. <br>  And 17 years later, I went.  But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my parents' savings were spent on preparing for it.  After six months, I did not see the meaning of my training.  I did not know what I wanted to do in my life, and did not understand how the college would help me to realize this.  And so, I just spent the money of parents, which they saved all their lives.  So I decided to quit college and believe that everything will be fine.  I was scared at first, but looking back now, I understand that this was my best decision in my whole life.  The minute I left college, I could stop talking about the fact that the required lessons were not interesting for me and attend those that seemed interesting. <br>  Not everything was so romantic.  I didn’t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends ’rooms, I donated 5 cents of Cola bottles to buy food and walked 7 miles across the city every Sunday evening to have a normal meal once a week in the Hare Krishna temple.  I liked him.  And much of what I came across, following my curiosity and intuition, turned out to be invaluable later. <br>  Here is an example: <br>  Reed College has always offered the best calligraphy lessons.  Throughout the campus, each poster, each label was handwritten in calligraphic handwriting.  Since I left and did not take regular lessons, I signed up for calligraphy lessons.  I learned about serif and sans serif, about the different indents between the combinations of letters, about what makes excellent typography beautiful.  She was beautiful, historic, and artistically refined to such an extent that science could not understand it. <br>  None of this seemed useful to my life.  But ten years later, when we were developing the first Macintosh, it all came in handy.  And Mac became the first computer with beautiful typography.  If I hadn’t enrolled in that college course, Mac would never have had several typefaces and proportional fonts.  Well, since Windows just blew it off of the Mac, most likely, personal computers would not have them at all.  If I had not expelled, I would never have enrolled in that calligraphy course and computers would not have such amazing typography as now. <br>  Of course, it was impossible to connect all the points together when I was in college.  But after ten years, everything became very, very clear. <br>  Once again: you cannot connect the points, looking forward;  you can connect them only looking to the past.  Therefore, you will have to trust those points that you somehow connect in the future.  You have to rely on something: your character, destiny, life, karma - whatever.  Such an approach never failed me and he changed my life. <br>  My second story is about love and loss. <br>  I was lucky - I found what I love to do in my life quite early.  Woz and I founded Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and ten years later Apple grew from two people in the garage to a $ 2 billion company with 4,000 employees.  We released our best creature, Macintosh, a year earlier and I just turned 30. And then I got fired.  How can you be fired from the company you founded?  Well, as Apple grew, we hired talented people to help me manage the company and in the first five years everything went well.  But then our vision of the future began to diverge and we eventually fell out.  Board of Directors went over to his side.  Therefore, in 30 years I was fired.  And publicly.  What was the meaning of my whole adult life is gone. <br>  I did not know what to do for a few months.  I felt that I had failed the past generation of entrepreneurs - that I dropped the baton when I was handed it.  I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for what I had done.  It was a public failure and I even thought about running far away.  But something slowly began to clear up in me - I still loved what I was doing.  The course of events at Apple only slightly changed everything.  I was rejected, but I loved.  And, in the end, I decided to start all over again. <br>  Then I did not understand this, but it turned out that the dismissal from Apple was the best that could happen to me.  The burden of a successful person has been replaced by the frivolity of a beginner, less sure of anything.  I was released and entered one of the most creative periods of my life. <br>  Over the next five years, I founded NeXT, another company called Pixar and fell in love with an amazing woman who became my wife.  Pixar has created the very first computer animation film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.  In the course of amazing events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology developed in NeXT became the heart of the current revival of Apple.  And Laurene and I became a wonderful family. <br>  I’m sure none of this would have happened if I hadn’t been fired from Apple.  The medicine was bitter, but it helped the patient.  Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick.  Do not lose faith.  I am convinced that the only thing that helped me to continue the business was that I loved my business.  You need to find what you love.  And this is as true for work as it is for relationships.  Your work will fill most of your life and the only way to be completely content is to do what you think is a great thing.  And the only way to do great things is to love what you do.  If you have not found your business, look for.  Do not stop.  As with all matters of the heart, you will know when you find it.  And, like any good relationship, they get better and better over the years.  So look until you find.  Do not stop. <br>  My third story is about death. <br>  When I was 17, I read a quote - something like this: “If you live every day as if it’s the last, you will be right someday.” The quote made an impression on me and since then, for 33 years, I look in the mirror every day and ask myself: “If today was the last in my life, would I want to do what I’m going to do today?”.  And as soon as the answer was “No” for several days in a row, I understood that something had to be changed. <br>  The memory that I will die soon is the most important tool that helps me make difficult decisions in my life.  Because everything else is another's opinion, all this pride, all this fear of embarrassment or failure — all these things fall in the face of death, leaving only what is really important.  The memory of death is the best way to avoid thinking about what you have to lose.  You are already naked.  You have no reason not to go to the call of your heart. <br>  About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer.  I received a scan at 7:30 in the morning and he clearly showed a tumor in the pancreas.  I did not even know what the pancreas is.  The doctors told me that this type of cancer is not curable and that I have no more than three to six months to live.  My doctor advised me to go home and put things in order (which, in the case of doctors, means getting ready for death).  It means trying to tell your children what you would say in the next 10 years.  It means making sure that everything is safely arranged, so that your family will be as easy as possible.  It means saying goodbye. <br>  I lived with this diagnosis all day.  Later in the evening I had a biopsy - they put an endoscope in my throat, climbed through my stomach and intestines, stuck a needle into the pancreas and took several cells from the tumor.  I was blacked out, but my wife, who was there, said that when the doctors looked at the cells under a microscope, they started screaming because I had a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that can be cured by surgery.  I had an operation and now everything is fine with me. <br>  Death then came closest to me, and I hope the closest in the next few decades.  Having lived through this, I can now say the following with more confidence than when death was a useful, but purely fictional, concept: <br>  No one wants to die.  Even people who want to go to heaven do not want to die.  Still, death is the destination for all of us.  No one could ever escape her.  It should be so because Death is probably the best invention of Life.  She is the cause of change.  It clears the old to open the way to the new.  Now the new is you, but once (not very long), you will become old and clean you up.  Sorry for such drama, but it's true. <br>  Your time is limited, so don’t waste it on someone’s life.  Do not fall into the trap of dogma, which says to live with the thoughts of others.  Do not let the noise of others' opinions interrupt your inner voice.  And most importantly, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.  They somehow already know what you really want to be.  Everything else is secondary. <br>  When I was young, I read the amazing publication The Whole Earth Catalog (“The Catalog of the Whole Earth”), which was one of the bibles of my generation.  She wrote a guy named Stewart Brand, who lives here near Menlo Park.  It was at the end of the sixties, before personal computers and desktop publishing houses, so it was made with the help of typewriters, scissors, and polaroids.  Something like Google on paper, 35 years before Google.  The publication was idealistic and overflowing with big ideas. <br>  Steward and his team made several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog and, eventually, published the final issue.  It was in the mid 70s and I was your age.  On the last page of the cover was a photo of the road in the early morning, like the one on which you might have caught cars if you loved adventures.  Below her were the words: “Stay hungry.  Stay reckless. ”  This was their farewell message.  Stay hungry.  Stay reckless.  And I have always wished for this myself.  And now, when you graduate and start anew, I wish you this. <br>  Stay hungry.  Stay reckless. <br>  Thank you all very much. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23512/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23512/</a></p>
