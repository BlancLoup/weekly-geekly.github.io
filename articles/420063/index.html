  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Holy" Timlid and his followers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are two weeks left before <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/">Saint TeamLead Conf</a> , a conference on the pain of the tmilid.  In this conference, we no longer wanted to simply identify as many problems as possible, but wanted to reveal each topic from different points of view.  We, <b>together</b> with the program committee, based on the February TeamLead Conf, <b>put together all the main activities of the team leader</b> (let's not forget that while everyone is investing in this role is different).  The resulting was generalized, structured and used as building blocks for building a program: communications;  measurement and evaluation;  work with knowledge;  team building and building processes;  team motivation;  and work on oneself, which includes the same thing: ‚ÄúI have become a team leader, and what now.‚Äù <br><br>  The schedule turned out to be very <b>balanced and balanced</b> , I think there are several reports in each of the 10 areas, and the presentations within one section follow each other and the participant will not need to choose which communication report is more interesting to him.  You just come on September 24, on Monday, into the second room, comfortably settled, you lay out a brochure and a notebook - and absorb someone else's experience.  During breaks you ask questions and communicate with ‚Äúcolleagues in misfortune‚Äù.  It will be convenient, and, we hope, <b>will allow everyone to find tips for their tasks</b> . <br><br>  Under the cut, briefly about each topic to show you our thoughtful conference structure.  But the report is 32, so in general it is long.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4t/d9/m2/4td9m2pbqymww0sbpe43acbzv54.png"><br><br>  <strong>TL; DR:</strong> Here is a link to the <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/schedule.html">schedule</a> , you can poke only in separate reports - they all have a lot of living experience, practice and very specific recommendations. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  September 24, Monday <br></h2><br>  We need to start with something vigorous, so let's start with the <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3827">story of</a> <strong>Yuliya Kurapatsenkava</strong> about how Spotify <strong>works</strong> .  We will look at the <b>experience of a large foreign company</b> from the inside and try to understand how this is applicable in our realities.  By the way, the report will be in English - at the same time we are activating our brains in the morning. <br><br>  At the same time, in the second hall there will be a completely different <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3989">report</a> from <strong>Ekaterina Evtukhova</strong> about the transition from the developer to the team leader and further adventures.  It will be interesting to those who are approaching the leadership or have just started and discovered a wonderful new world of completely unexpected problems. <br><br>  After the entry, divide the audience.  One track for those who adhere to strict views and prefers to measure everything with concrete numbers, including the effectiveness of employees and teams.  The second is about those very communications. <br><br><h3>  Measurement and Evaluation <br></h3><br>  <strong>Max Boguslavsky</strong> generally loves to count something and has long been interested in collecting metrics.  To discuss on the subject of <b>whether metrics are needed</b> , we will not, and <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3820">we‚Äôll</a> better <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3820">understand</a> which ones and what decisions can be made on their basis.  There will be many examples of unobvious data, or even obvious ones, but which are forgotten all the time. <br><br>  <strong>Sergey Semenov</strong> from GitLean <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3983">will show</a> that it is possible to automatically collect data and about the processes in the team, tell you how to implement it, and again, what to do with it then. <br><br>  After lunch, let's focus on <b>team efficiency</b> . <br><br>  <strong>Alexey Kataev</strong> <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3866">will tell you</a> about Skyeng‚Äôs experience of using dozens of metrics to evaluate teams.  We will listen to which of them helped to reveal the bottlenecks, and which did not work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i5/iq/ua/i5iquasfotavrjw_tz_e6nab6ri.png"><br><br>  After that, <strong>Igor Lukanin</strong> <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/4046">will share the</a> detailed results of the annual and large-scale research of SKB Kontur.  This is not to say that the result is shocking - <strong>intuition does not work</strong> .  Then we will deal with the struggle for efficiency "by instrument", and not by instinct. <br><br><h3>  Communications <br></h3><br>  Speakers will learn to communicate by their own example - they are all experienced and cool storytellers. <br><br>  <strong>Stas Michalsky</strong> (Biglion) <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/4026">will tell you</a> that verbal agreements are great, but it is better to manage them.  Personally, I will go to listen, because the farther up, the harder it is with this question. <br><br>  <strong>Alexander Ziza</strong> (Aletheia Business) promises, after his <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/4022">report</a> you will receive a concrete plan for the development of the communicative skill <strong>from the level of ‚Äúbeginner‚Äù to the level of ‚Äúvery cool‚Äù</strong> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pi/ov/-u/piov-utr9pudajn6qfydavillcy.png"><br><br>  They will certainly take part in the <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3755">round table</a> , which, under the leadership of <strong>Georgy Mogelashvili</strong> , will close the first day with the debate on " <strong>How to measure a programmer</strong> ." <br><br>  <strong>Evgenia Golev</strong> from Tech.Lamoda <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3901">will talk</a> about communication for the purpose of sharing knowledge, or as her report is called: "Knowledge Sharing In and Out." <br><br>  After lunch, we will further delve into the issues of working with knowledge. <br><br><h3>  Knowledge <br></h3><br>  <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/4015">Report by</a> <strong>Maxim Babich</strong> on knowledge management through competency models.  He has a whole startup on this topic, so there will be a <strong>lot of experience</strong> . <br><br>  <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3873">The story</a> from Iponweb will be presented by <strong>Svetlana Novikova</strong> and <strong>Konstantin Kaftan</strong> - about the use of the competence matrix in order to adjust the management and exchange of knowledge. <br><br>  <strong>Vladimir Romanko</strong> from Kaspersky Lab <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3816">will put forward</a> an atypical position <b>about the dangers of labeling on competencies</b> .  If a person can and wants to solve a problem, it is necessary to give him such an opportunity, even if he has not left the rank. <br><br>  This idea translates us smoothly to the next report on motivation. <br><br>  <strong>Evgeny Peshkov</strong> will tell how to introduce, and motivate, of course, people on all that agile and turquoise principles that are applied in Dodo Pizza.  This is the last <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3997">report</a> in the track, it will be possible to torture the speaker with questions until he escapes to the afterparty. <br><br><blockquote>  Reports will be very useful, but the importance of networking has not been canceled.  There will be meetings, backstage discussions, stand discussions and, of course, an evening program.  There we will discuss everything that does not fit in the reports. <br></blockquote><br><h2>  September 25, Tuesday <br></h2><br>  In the morning session of the second day there are two competing tracks: about building a team, and about finding and developing people.  They seem to be similar, but in fact they solve different problems.  The first is the history of team growth, about changes in processes and about people. <br><br><h3>  Team building <br></h3><br>  <strong>Evgeny Fedoreyev</strong> banki.ru about how the engineering team was experiencing repeated changes of technical directors, which did not prevent the growth and the emergence of new full-fledged development teams. <br><br>  Dodo Pizza with their performances at other conferences and, for example, have established themselves as process maniacs.  Chief Agile Officer (whatever that means) <strong>Anton Bevzyuk</strong> on Saint TeamLead Conf <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3646">will tell</a> about the ficacomand. <br><br><h3>  Search and development <br></h3><br>  And in a parallel track about how to search and then <b>develop fighters</b> .  The shortage of shots rolls in waves, and now, in my opinion, this topic is again hot. <br><br>  <strong>Andrei Timonich</strong> will <strong>begin with a</strong> <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3804">report</a> on how Tinkoff.ru works with juniors and grow superheroes from them - it will be interesting to stop being guided by rumors and learn the inner kitchen. <br><br>  Next will be the <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3876">report of</a> <strong>Anatoly Panov</strong> from Avito.  This is again a level above the team lead - it is just about his search, both within the team and outside.  But it <b>will be useful for everyone</b> , because it will help to look from the outside, why the long-awaited promotion within the company does not always happen, but someone from the outside is taken. <br><br>  <strong>Katerina Gavrilova</strong> heads the staffing agency DigitalHR, which is engaged in the selection of technical posts.  I have conducted hundreds of interviews and <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/4014">will tell you</a> how to work as effectively as possible in participating in hiring people in your team. <br><br>  It turned out <strong>versatile</strong> : how to grow within the company, to recruit from the street, how to properly organize the selection and effectively conduct it. <br><br><h3>  Building processes <br></h3><br>  After lunch, we will tilt over to the burning and therefore the most extensive topic about processes.  In it, and tech reports and more soft. <br><br>  <strong>Sergey Kuks</strong> from JetBrains promises to <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/4004">tell you</a> how to release seven related products just in a quarter and not kill each other.  Using the example of a company whose products everyone uses to develop faster and better, let's see what is at the next level.  We will get acquainted with <strong>technical solutions</strong> for streamlining business processes and establishing communication between teams. <br><br>  <strong>Timur Pavlov</strong> <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3634">will tell you</a> how Positive Technologies plans and organizes production bug fixes along with the development of new functionality.  A problem familiar to everyone whose products live long enough and need support.  From the report we learn <b>how to take into account the time to fix bugs</b> and continue to move forward with the planned speed. <br><br>  Continuing the theme, but with a greater admixture of non-technical peculiarities, the <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3700">report by</a> <strong>Alexander Afenov</strong> from Lamoda ‚ÄúTechnical mortgage: what and to whom should the team leader‚Äù.  Let's talk how to cope with all the challenges and what approaches have worked well. <br><br>  <strong>Viktor Fabrichenko</strong> from Iponweb promises to <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3807">share a</a> unique story about two projects with similar problems: the conflict between business and development.  One of these projects managed to cope with the problem, and with the help of just a few simple techniques.  It will be interesting on real examples of <strong>positive and negative experiences</strong> , which companies usually prefer to hush up, to compare exit strategies from the crisis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vb/n0/o7/vbn0o7lmlqgir0hcdbv4utki-fo.png"><br><br>  Meanwhile, <strong>Sergey Popov</strong> from League A. / HTML Academy increases the degree of difficulty.  His <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3930">report</a> on what everyone is afraid of - <b>junior, and even on the remote</b> .  Company League A essentially lives on this, it helps them to cope with the shortage of personnel and to develop steadily. <br><br>  <strong>Victor Nikishin</strong> from Tinkoff.ru will complete the program with a <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3858">story</a> about how you can, without being an expert in this field, recruit a team, set and evaluate tasks for it and successfully develop the project. <br><br><h3>  Self-development for development managers <br></h3><br>  <strong>Evgeni Kot</strong> opens this section with clever thoughts about what to do when you become a team leader.  This is a <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3818">story</a> for those who wrote their code calmly, and then suddenly bang - and you have to do a lot of everything else, often new.  It will be about the fact that <b>hardskie is good, but there are softskily</b> , without which nothing good will work. <br><br>  <strong>Alexey Shagraev</strong> from Yandex in his <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/4096">report</a> plans to destroy the popular myth that it is impossible to <strong>combine management and engineering activity</strong> .  It turns out you can successfully develop managerial skills and continue to pump technical. <br><br>  <strong>Stanislav Belyaev</strong> <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3867">will tell you</a> how to prepare for changes in the team and how to survive them being in the heat of the moment.  What is important, we will analyze the implementation in organizations and with a horizontal, structure and vertical. <br><br><h3>  Development <br></h3><br>  The working title of this small section was ‚ÄúThe Future‚Äù, in fact, because we are going to talk about approaches that may have a future. <br><br>  <strong>Maxim Tsepkov</strong> attends many conferences, knows a lot and actively shares his experience.  At Saint TeamLead Conf he will <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3786">enlighten</a> us on the topic of <b>turquoise organization</b> .  Everyone is interested in her, they are vividly discussing, but they are often poorly understood and have not seen living examples.  So we will try to understand what it is when the responsibility for decisions on the performer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yk/rd/8q/ykrd8qye6fanoksbeo1vsbwdx4y.png"><br><br>  This also includes a report from a representative of Sberbank-Technologies.  We do not often see them at conferences, although many interesting solutions are being introduced.  Therefore, the report of <strong>Yevgeny Rtishchev</strong> with the hyip name ‚Äú <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/3822">Motivation of the team through the mining of game currency</a> ‚Äù should be very exciting and at the same time very useful, since the issues we discuss are really very complex.  Even just a call to think about them already pulls on value. <br><br>  And at the end of the second day, <strong>Alexander Polomodov</strong> from Tinkoff.ru will tell an amazing <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/abstracts/4029">story of</a> how the development department had to be done from the marketing department.  The point is that the customers of this team, like those of the marketing department, have an insane amount.  Again, the growth of employees on the order.  All this with features and examples will be great. <br><br><h2>  Master Classes <br></h2><br>  This is more than traditional mitapas in HighLoad ++, where some narrow questions are simply humanly discussed.  <a href="https://teamleadconf.ru/spb/2018/meetups">Master classes</a> at Saint TeamLead Conf will be practically exercises. <br><br>  We specifically invited <strong>Alexandra Baptismanskaya</strong> , who will play with those who wish in the Agile-game ‚Äú <b>Collaborative origami</b> ‚Äù.  In the course of the game, participants will personally evaluate the effectiveness of different types of communication (personal meetings, video calls, mail, messengers, etc.) and draw valuable conclusions. <br><br>  And on the second day, in continuation of the speech, Stas Michalsky will hold a <strong>practical workshop on creating agreements in the Scrum team</strong> .  The workshop is practical, so we will develop a practical skill - how, within the framework of the Scrum framework, to create in the team working arrangements that will make Scrum really work. <br><br>  As well as traditional and diverse coaching at the Aletheia Business booth. <br><br>  Here is a plan.  I expect that it will be very <b>cheerful and informative</b> .  In addition, the conference in St. Petersburg - culture, architecture and the Baltic (sea or beer - underline the necessary). <br><br><blockquote>  I repeat, participation is also an opportunity to ask various tough specialists about how it happens in other areas and companies.  In addition, as the practice of the February conference showed, these are interesting to the team leaders, developers, managers, CTO, and all Relations.  If in doubt - do not hesitate, <a href="https://conf.ontico.ru/conference/join/tl2018-spb.html">book tickets</a> . <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/420063/">https://habr.com/ru/post/420063/</a></p>
