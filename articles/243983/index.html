  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Keystone NAP will transform steel plant in data center</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Keystone NAP is building a new data center at the site of a former steel mill in Bucks County, PA.  Commissioning is planned for the first quarter of 2015. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DW_Do6TsTKk8%26feature%3Dyoutu.be">steel plant</a> was built 60 years ago and at one time was one of the largest steel producers in the United States.  Steel production declined, but the huge energy infrastructure remained.  That's just her Keystone NAP plans to actively use and integrate with the modular building for the new data center, and Schneider Electric will help her in this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/47b/989/e32/47b989e327e4442cb47f6513625159c8.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚ÄúPay attention to the scale of projects launched by companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook,‚Äù says Peter Ritz, Keystone NAP‚Äôs executive director - their projects cost billions of dollars, our company is interested in developing projects that would bring real benefits less costly than the projects of Internet giants.

      Bax County is just an hour north of Philadelphia.  Although here the market for data centers is underdeveloped, but the location of Philadelphia and Bucks County is advantageous, as they are located between several major data center markets.  ‚ÄúIn the northeast, and in particular in eastern Pennsylvania, there is now a growing demand for data centers as an alternative to markets such as New York and New Jersey,‚Äù said Kelly Morgan, data center research manager at <a href="https://451research.com/">451 Research</a> , Philadelphia, a good combination: free space, energy resources, labor, give us every reason to expect that Keystone NAP will soon feel the high demand for a new facility. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4bd/92f/2b8/4bd92f2b87554089be3f7adf59677c65.png"><br><br>  The company received <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seriesa.asp">funding for Series A</a> with the support of well-known Philadelphia investors, led by Ira Lubert, as well as the support of DH Capital investors.  Ira Lubert was the owner of <a href="">NAP of the Americas</a> , a huge data center built in Miami, which was eventually sold to Terremark (now part of Verizon). <br><br><h4>  On the shoulders of giants </h4><br>  The modular approach, which the company adheres to, perfectly combines with the master plan.  ‚ÄúWe thought that choosing this place for a data center of this type would provide great opportunities.  We stand on the shoulders of giants who used to be here, ‚Äùsaid Peter Ritz, referring to the metallurgical plant, the construction of which many years ago used a number of complex engineering technologies.  A similar project, <a href="http://www.cra-architects.com/project/data-center-mission-critical/steel-orca-data-center/">Steel Orca</a> , had already been proposed several years ago, right down to its location (a steel mill on the Trenton River, New Jersey).  Keystone NAP introduces many concepts and innovations at the right time. <br><br>  The company is currently in the process of refurbishing the engine room of the former steel plant.  The metallurgical plant used arc furnaces that consumed about 300 MW.  ‚ÄúSurprisingly, despite the fact that engineers did not have supercomputers in the 1950s, the plant never stopped in its history due to power loss,‚Äù said Peter Ritz. <br><br><h4>  Wide fuel selection </h4><br>  Four independent substations will produce 2,000 MW on site.  The fuel for the independent power plants will be used: natural gas, coal, gas from organic waste released from garbage.  The fuel produced will become a strategic fuel reserve. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7f/4e0/479/c7f4e04791154fbaa29d3d3be52e4630.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúWe provide different types of fuel.  During Hurricane Sandy (a powerful tropical cyclone formed at the end of October 2012 and affecting Jamaica, Cuba, the Bahamas, Haiti, Florida coast) situations that have developed in many enterprises, prompted me to become independent from the suppliers of diesel fuel.  Our solution is to be close to the production of fuel, to use different types of fuel in order to avoid problems, ‚Äùsaid Peter Ritz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/455/3c6/4b5/4553c64b5e664720978a23371b6908c0.jpg"><br><br>  As for cooling, the Delaware River flows near the chosen place, and there is also a small bay, which in total creates a good water reserve, which will serve as an addition to the basic method of air cooling. <br><br><h4>  Schneider Modules </h4><br>  Keystone NAP in partnership with Schneider is going to build a data center using the so-called KeyBlock.  As a result, compact modular data warehouses are obtained, which make it possible to provide infrastructure that is flexibly customizable by the customer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf8/368/ad3/bf8368ad37f34377a0b9b4be17e1e609.jpg"><br><br>  The modules are quickly and easily put into operation, while ensuring uninterrupted power supply up to 400 kW per KeyBlock.  Data warehouses have different levels of access, which allows Kaystone NAP to guarantee the quality of the services provided, based on an agreement on the level of individual service with an individual client. <br><br>  The engine room of the former Fairless Hills was once the center of activity of a metallurgical plant.  But very soon it will become the data center management IT center and will support the technological needs of Keystone NAP along the entire east coast. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vwGrYFQtn5A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/243983/">https://habr.com/ru/post/243983/</a></p>
