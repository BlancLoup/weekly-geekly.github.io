Smarty CRM web service brand manager met him personally and found out how and what innovations penetrate into everyday life and what will change in 10 years.  In this article we want to share the main ideas from his speech.  I ask those interested under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Tom Rafteri's presentation is available <a href="https://docviewer.yandex.ru/view/692303626/%3F*%3D8WILupE%252B5pw97mT2OfIhajApi2d7InVybCI6InlhLWRpc2stcHVibGljOi8vTjl3c2krN0tUekFpYWovOWhjQUVMa0lmcVhUVXYvSmhBOW00WDVCanRoQ2haeUtyQ3JwZHE1TDhHaUFGRU96R3NMSzJXYndCa1IvL3FmbVZIb1BpbHc9PSIsInRpdGxlIjoiSW9UQ29uZk1vc2Nvdy1Ub21SYWZ0ZXJ5LnBkZiIsInVpZCI6IjY5MjMwMzYyNiIsInl1IjoiNjEwODA5MzA4MTUwNTIxNDY5MyIsIm5vaWZyYW1lIjpmYWxzZSwidHMiOjE1NTQ0NDQ4NzA5MTF9">here</a> . <br><br><h3>  Production </h3><br><h4>  Briefly about the forecast </h4><br>  The business-as-service business model will spread.  This means that the product is created on demand, but not stored in the warehouse, but immediately sent to the customer.  This significantly reduces the cost.  Customization is available.

    <h4>  Solutions </h4><br><ul><li>  <b>Motorcycles.</b>  Harley-Davidson offers customers to customize the parameters of the motorcycle.  You must go to the site, determine the characteristics and place an order.  You can even come to the factory and follow the process of creating a motorcycle.  Production time was reduced from 21 days to 6 hours. </li><li>  <b>Spare parts.</b>  UPS manufactures spare parts using 3D printers.  The list of parts is available on the website of the company.  The client must upload a 3D model to the site, select a material and determine the price.  After payment, he receives the order at. </li><li>  <b>Air.</b>  Kaeser Kompressoren at the request of customers makes compressed air.  It is needed to use pneumatic energy, for example, for jackhammers, diving cylinders or in paintball.  The customer sends the requirements and promptly receives a batch of cubic meters. </li></ul><br><h3>  Power industry </h3><br><h4>  Briefly about the forecast </h4><br>  Energy from the sun and wind will be cheaper than energy from gas and coal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pl/ty/aj/pltyajzb9w20w1igxv_xysxnus8.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  Solar power </h4><br><ul><li>  <b>Swanson effect.</b>  The watt of photovoltaic cells from crystalline silicon dropped from $ 76.67 in 1977 to $ 0.36 in 2014, that is, almost 213 times. </li><li>  <b>The amount of energy.</b>  In 2018, the power of the obtained solar energy reached 109 GW.  This is a record.  In 2019, growth is forecast to 141 GW. </li><li>  <b>Battery capacity.</b>  The capacity of lithium-ion batteries is growing.  By 2020, the mileage of the car without recharging will reach 1000 km, which is comparable to the "diesel". </li><li>  <b>Cost kWh</b>  The price of battery kWh is annually reduced.  If we compare prices for 2018 and 2010, it has decreased by 6.6 times. </li></ul><br><h4>  Solutions </h4><br>  The breakthrough is carried out not by energy companies, but by autocar manufacturers.  New technologies help to get solar energy and convert it into electricity.  It is used to ‚Äúcharge‚Äù cars and ‚Äúsmart‚Äù homes. <br><br><ul><li>  Tesla has signed a contract for the supply of solar panels and lithium-ion batteries for 50,000 homes in Australia. </li><li>  Similar products and services offered by Nissan, which has developed its own technology. </li></ul><br>  The new solutions are reminiscent of virtual cloud-based factories.  For example, an electric car has an 80 kWh battery.  250,000 cars are 20 gWh.  In fact, it is a mobile, distributed and managed energy storage. <br><br><h3>  Wind energy </h3><br>  In the next 10 years, it will become the largest energy source in Europe.  Wind turbines will be more profitable than gas or coal. <br><br><h4>  Solutions </h4><br><ul><li>  Tesla has built a battery station in Australia that runs on wind turbines.  Its creation cost $ 66 million. In the first year of operation, it ‚Äúbeat off‚Äù $ 40 million of investments, in the second year it will pay off in full. </li><li>  Hywind Scotland, a wind station on the water, provided energy to 20,000 UK households.  The power factor was 65%, for gas and coal it is lower on average - 54-55%. </li></ul><br><h4>  How it will affect </h4><br>  You will become more energetic :) <br><br><h3>  Health care </h3><br><h4>  Briefly about the forecast </h4><br>  Doctors will be able to monitor the health of patients 24/7 and receive alarming signals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e3/42/l8/e342l8fjnut1iyikqmvkfksbzjw.png"><br><br><h4>  Solutions </h4><br><ul><li>  <b>Monitoring</b>  Sensors monitor health parameters: pressure, pulse, sugar level, etc.  Data is collected 24/7, transmitted to doctors in the cloud, alerts are configured.  Example: FreeStyle Libre. </li><li>  <b>HLS.</b>  Gamification is used to lead a healthy lifestyle.  Users complete tasks, get loans, buy drinks for them and go to the movies.  They are less likely to get sick and recover faster.  Example: Vitality </li><li>  <b>Transportation.</b>  B2B platforms help to bring people to clinics and hospitals faster.  Examples: Uber Health, Lyft and Allscripts.  It's like a normal Uber, just an ambulance. </li><li>  <b>Clinics.</b>  IT organizations have established medical clinics.  They treat only their employees.  Examples: Amazon (with JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway) and Apple. </li><li>  <b>Artificial Intelligence.</b>  Now Google AI detects breast cancer with an accuracy of 99%.  In the future, the corporation plans to invest in disease diagnostics, data infrastructure, and health insurance. </li></ul><br><h4>  How it will affect </h4><br>  The patient will know the diagnosis and get a prescription before contacting a doctor personally.  If you need to go to the hospital, you will not have to wait for an ambulance.  Drug injections are automated. <br><br><h3>  Transport </h3><br><h4>  Briefly about the forecast </h4><br>  Electric engines will significantly press internal combustion engines. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h-/bf/dv/h-bfdvmuaswcajtvmdter3mzgh8.png"><br><br><h4>  Solutions </h4><br><ul><li>  For cars: Toyota, Ford, VW, GM, PSA Group, Daimler, Porsche, BMW, Audi, Lexus. </li><li>  For trucks: Daimler, DAF, Peterbilt, Renault, Tesla, VW. </li><li>  For motorcycles: Harley Davidson, Zero. </li><li>  For airplanes: Airbus, Boeing, Rolls-Royce, EasyJet. </li><li>  For excavators: Caterpillar. </li><li>  For trains: Enel, which supplies lithium-ion RZD batteries. </li><li>  For ships: Siemens, Rolls-Royce. </li></ul><br><h4>  Laws </h4><br>  In Spain, ordinary cars have already closed access to the center of Madrid.  Now only electric cars and hybrids can enter there. <br><br>  In Sweden, since 2030, they have banned the production of cars with an internal combustion engine. <br><br>  A ban similar to the Swedish was introduced in Norway, but it will come into force 5 years earlier: in 2025. <br><br>  In China, it is required that at least 10% of the vehicles supplied to the country be electric.  In 2020, the quota will be expanded to 25%. <br><br><h4>  How it will affect </h4><br><ul><li>  Liquidation of gas stations.  They will be replaced by refueling V2G (Vehicle-to-grid).  They will allow you to connect the car to the grid.  As the owner of the electric car, you can buy or sell electricity to other car owners.  Example: Google. </li><li>  Transfer of weather data.  You can install sensors that collect data about the weather: precipitation, temperature, wind, humidity, etc.  The data will be bought by meteorological companies, since the information is more accurate and relevant.  Example: Continental. </li><li>  Batteries for rent.  Car battery is expensive.  Not everyone buys a few pieces, but it depends on how far the transport will travel without recharging.  Renting additional batteries will allow you to travel long distances. </li></ul><br><h3>  Autonomy </h3><br><h4>  Briefly about the forecast </h4><br>  Drivers will not be needed.  To drive will become unprofitable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ed/e8/6i/ede86i7y4_m1eviefqymzdqxkr0.png"><br><br><h4>  Solutions </h4><br>  Created a class of self-driving cars, which is more effective than usual. <br><br><ul><li>  Without steering and pedals.  General Motors has released a car without manual controls.  It operates independently and carries passengers. </li><li>  Self-propelled taxi.  Waymo ("daughter" of Google) has launched a taxi service, which costs virtually no driver. </li><li>  Tesla autopilot.  With him the risk of getting into an accident decreased by 40%.  Insurers offered discounts to those who use autopilot. </li><li>  Goods delivery.  Kroger supermarkets launched unmanned grocery delivery.  Previously, the company organized 20 robotic warehouses. </li></ul><br><h4>  How it will affect </h4><br>  Transportation will be cheaper to decline due to lower cost and increased payback. <br><br><ul><li>  Round-the-clock work.  Self-governing cars constantly take orders and do not stop at the "smoke". </li><li>  Lack of drivers.  They will not have to pay.  Driving schools will close.  You do not need to pass on the right. </li><li>  Reducing the number of breakdowns.  In conventional cars - 2000 moving elements, in autonomous - 20. Less breakdowns - cheaper maintenance. </li><li>  Reducing the number of accidents.  Self-governing cars are less likely to have an accident.  No need to spend money on auto repair and treatment of the body. </li><li>  Savings on parking.  After the trip, you can send the car to carry other passengers or send it to the garage. </li></ul><br><h3>  Conclusion: what will happen to people? </h3><br>  Even with total automation, people will not be left without work.  Their employment is transformed with the new infrastructure. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hb/se/eb/hbseebdbefbg3sffua2zozjhm4c.png"><br><br>  Routine operations will be performed without human intervention.  The quality of life will increase.  There will be more time for yourself and solving world problems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447838/">https://habr.com/ru/post/447838/</a></p>
