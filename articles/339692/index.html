  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to successfully implement the Help Desk? 12 examples (part 2)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last week, the creators of the <a href="https://okdesk.ru/">Okdesk</a> cloud Help Desk service published the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/okdesk/blog/339170/">first part of</a> stories from around the world about the results of the Help Desk implementation for ‚Äúexternal‚Äù customer support.  Now, if you want to justify to your management the need for a project to launch an after-sales service automation system, then as an example you can talk about how: <br><br><ul><li>  Sennheiser reduced the response time to applications more than 5 times; </li><li>  Whirpool reduces incoming emails by 20%; </li><li>  Jamberry reduces support staff by more than 20%; </li><li>  Keisystems-Ivanovo - increased the satisfaction of supporting its customers (state and local authorities) to 96.4% </li></ul><br>  Today we publish the second part of the stories of successful implementation of such solutions. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/7b/59db7be90a351820313921.jpeg" width="600"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  1. Cloud Lifepics photo service reduces the talk time with the client by an average of 70% </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/7c/59db7c040e310383870141.jpeg" width="500"></div><br>  It is believed that when improving support processes, it is not necessary to insist on reducing the time of communication with the client.  On the contrary, it is better to attend to an increase in the number of incidents resolved during the first appeal.  Despite this, reducing talk time (i.e., optimizing the employment of contact center employees and, ultimately, saving on salary) sometimes becomes a related bonus. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      So, for example, the photo-service Lifepics switched to a tool for accounting client requests with a simpler interface. <br><br>  The main consumers of the service are private users who are far from technology, as well as electronics retailers, among which there is a high turnover (and therefore, re-training in solving the same issues).  It is this contingent that forms the lion‚Äôs share of support appeals.  Thus, most of the applications can be considered typical. <br><br>  The new toolkit allows you to quickly document the essence of calls and search for problems in the knowledge base.  A <b>reduction in talk time allowed for the same time to process approximately 70% more calls, which ultimately increased customer satisfaction by 40%</b> . <br><br><h2>  2. MetroHealth System saves a week in each month of work of employees, due to more simple reporting </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/7c/59db7c028fe2c520760828.jpeg" width="500"></div><br>  Unlike most companies, which were discussed earlier, the MetroHealth System hospital system has long been automated to record support applications.  But the selection of a tool with a more user-friendly interface for reporting on the work of the Service Desk <b>made it possible to free up a specialist week (Service Desk Manager) in each month of work</b> .  Previously, this week was spent on analyzing the work of the department (and under this it was necessary to keep a separate ‚Äúguru‚Äù exporting the data needed by the management), and now the required documents are formed in a few hours, and the data can even highlight the manual itself - i.e.  employees who are not narrow specialists in the automation system. <br><br>  That is why when choosing the Help Desk you need to pay attention to the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/okdesk/blog/306326/">most important functions</a> . <br><br>  It should be noted that the result was achieved, despite the inevitable complication of the entire system, due to the fact that the organization works in the field of medicine in the United States.  They take the secrets of personal data and medical information seriously.  Accordingly, in such organizations, when working with tickets, one should take into account the degree of confidentiality of information that comes into the view of IT professionals. <br><br><h2>  3. "Business Technology" 100% eliminates customer churn and concludes a larger number of contracts on a subscriber basis. </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/7b/59db7be957262965417440.jpeg" width="500"></div><br>  In the summer of 2017, at the height of the holiday season, the company ‚ÄúBusiness Technology‚Äù (Sochi), engaged in the automation of HoReCa and other industries, left 2 customers for a month, who brought 100,000 rubles annually while being on subscription service.  This happened due to the loss of their applications and, as a result, business downtime from failure to eliminate faults. <br><br>  Taking into account the fact that the attraction of new customers has recently become very expensive, Business Technology, which has not yet used the Help Desk, made an immediate decision to implement a specialized <a href="https://okdesk.ru/">accounting system and solutions for</a> Okdesk <a href="https://okdesk.ru/">client applications</a> . <br><br>  The result of the implementation was not only 100% exclusion of customer churn due to the loss of applications, but also the conclusion of a larger number of contracts on a subscriber basis.  The introduction of Okdesk made it possible to immediately understand that only 20-30% of applications come from customers on the subscription fee, the rest of the applications come from customers who do not agree to the subscription fee and pay for services after the fact.  When making decisions about the implementation of appeals in the company, they were guided by ‚Äúnoise,‚Äù or rather, priority was given to those who scream more, who are ‚Äúon‚Äù, etc.  By changing the approach to work and reorienting it to customers with a monthly fee, the company managed to reasonably transfer a large number of customers to long-term service contracts. <br><br><h2>  4. Heartland ECSI saves time, equivalent to loading one full-time employee </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/7c/59db7c02aec7b580865302.jpeg" width="500"></div><br>  The history of Heartland ECSI is a good example of the fact that you can search for a suitable solution for a rather long time.  Although usually companies that jump from supplier to supplier rarely really find the optimum - more often they spend the budget on constant re-implementations without gaining important benefits. <br><br>  Heartland ECSI provides financial services to colleges and students enrolled in them;  services include payments, debt tracking, etc.  within the American education system.  In fact, the company has two areas of support: for its own clients (college staff) and for students.  The last and currently used solution to automate the recording of applications for support was selected after evaluation of 15!  various tools.  The tested solutions did not have the necessary flexibility of the company in the appointment of tickets (especially in their visibility).  Accordingly, no solution previously could not reflect the working business processes. <br><br>  The solution implemented as a result allowed us to save support time equivalent to the working time of one employee in full time.  At the same time, in accordance with the latest trends, many channels of communication with customers are supported. <br><br><h2>  5. Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel LLP up to 80% increase in the proportion of calls addressed after the first call </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/7c/59db7c03c09aa584979687.jpeg" width="500"></div><br>  The law firm Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel LLP is in the top 100 companies in its industry in the world.  Its employees use a variety of IT tools, the performance of which is critical in order to meet the deadlines for interaction with the judicial system - periods of filing lawsuits, appeals, etc.  Emerging IT problems are solved by internal support, whose task is to minimize staff downtime due to infrastructure. <br><br>  Through the use of a convenient tool for automating the accounting of applications for technical support, up to 80% of problems are solved after the first call.  This toolkit has been used for more than 15 years - since 2001.  During this time, employee satisfaction with internal IT support services increased by 85%, reaching a rating of 4.9 out of 5.0.  This happened due to the continuous improvement of the solution.  Those.  The final high score was not achieved by a one-time implementation, but by continuous long-term improvement. <br><br><h2>  6. The company INNIKO, serving commercial real estate, reduces 300 man-hours of downtime per month </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/7b/59db7be9263d3025805021.jpeg" width="500"></div><br>  Until recently, the company INNIKO, serving commercial real estate in the city of Perm, kept records of client requests in the Excel spreadsheet (why <a href="https://okdesk.ru/blog/no-excel">Excel is a poor means for recording and processing requests,</a> we wrote on our blog).  Because of the impossibility of the normal planning of the work of field specialists, the staff every day more than an hour, or even two, waited for referrals to clients. <br><br>  The introduction of the new cloud <a href="https://okdesk.ru/">Helpdesk system,</a> according to the company‚Äôs estimates, <b>helped save about 300 hours of downtime per month, while optimizing the payroll by 20%</b> .  At the same time, the company did without forced layoffs: the team really declined, but due to a well-thought-out loading system, first of all the best employees were left by the most low-skilled workers, and on their own (due to underload).  Those.  the company has only benefited from this. <br>  It should be noted that the company was able to find the right way of implementation, which did not meet much resistance of employees.  You can read more about this story in <a href="https://okdesk.ru/blog/innico">this article</a> . <br><br><h2>  An average business wins up to $ 20,000 from introducing web-based tools for recording and automating work with support applications. </h2><br>  Our last story is not about the company, but about the market segment. <br><br>  According to TechValidate, <b>medium-sized businesses win $</b> 10‚Äì20,000 <b>per</b> year in money, staff time, or other resources, <b>through the implementation of the Help Desk automation tools</b> .  Statistics was collected by TechValidate among current users of one of the automation systems for recording applications for technical support relating to the medium-sized business segment (several dozen companies participated in the survey). <br><br>  <i>In all the above stories we are talking about real and serious benefits achieved through the introduction of customer service tools and Help Desk systems.</i>  <i>Of course, these advantages are not always financial.</i>  <i>But often, indirectly, they generate significant revenues (or reduce costs).</i>  <i>Unfortunately, companies in Russia do not always take into account such an indirect method of return on investment.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>It is also important to note that improvements can be assessed only if the company has already calculated any metrics.</i>  <i>In the absence of values ‚Äã‚Äãof certain indicators, the effectiveness of innovations cannot be measured - but this does not mean that there are no problems and there is no need to ‚Äúautomate‚Äù.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339692/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339692/</a></p>
