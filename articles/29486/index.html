A meeting at the level of directors gives the result after 30 minutes.  Often enough is a regular phone call.  Is it a question of the powers of the people or something else?

      Perhaps the root cause is that due to our fast-growing industry, the leaders of many IT companies are people who are specialists in their fields, but do not know how to perform the functions of managers, and often do not know how to agree, hear the other side. <br><br>  He discussed a similar problem with the director of a construction company, Victor Nevara.  An experienced and mature man, he says that in the Soviet Union people have worked in the same position for years and gained experience, studied and grew in proportion to their experience and knowledge.  And now the market is sublimating ‚Äúpositions‚Äù, while knowledge and heads remain at the same level. <br><br>  This morning I had breakfast and watched Discovery.  They told about the history of cars and the Japanese philosophy of production values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the customer.  I have long been fond of the Japanese strategy for producing maximum value added, and not just turnover or maximizing profits.  But then I heard the new word Muda (muda).  I repeat the meaning of the word. <br><br>  <strong>Muda (muda)</strong> - means losses, unjustified expenses - any activity that consumes resources, but does not create value for the client. <br>  <em>"Many losses at the enterprise that impede efficiency are embedded in the organization of interaction between the divisions," says Andrei Gavrichenkov.</em>  <em>- In carrying out their functions, employees often do not think at all about how they will continue to interact with their neighbors ‚Äî internal suppliers and customers.</em>  <em>Everything that does not bring value to the client can be attributed to losses.</em>  <em>This is an unnecessary movement of people, an extra stage between treatments, waiting in the process of order processing, transportation.</em>  <em>Everything that we spend resources on, but not needed by the client, refers to losses.</em>  <em>And this concerns not only production processes, but also work with documents.</em>  <em>For example, the process of endorsing a document takes three hours, but at the same time 90% of this time with the document does not perform any operations - it just lies on the table.</em>  <em>We must not forget that for the customer the lead time of the order is an indicator of the value of services.</em>  <em>After all, wasted time often entails additional costs (for example, for the rental of premises) or downtime at work. "</em> <br><br>  A source: <br>  <a href="http://www.kioda.ru/art_kaizen2.html">www.kioda.ru/art_kaizen2.html</a> <br><br>  As an example of Muda, I will give a case from my life.  At that time I worked in a bank and headed the department of Internet technologies, telecommunications and payment systems.  And on duty, he oversaw the lease contracts for sewage through which the wires from the bank building pass.  And once Telecommunications increased the rental price by 3 times!  ‚ÄúThe horror,‚Äù said the vice-president of the bank, is unacceptable, ‚Äúmake‚Äù them.  The lawyers worked for two weeks, made up complaints, corresponded with Telecommunications, time dragged on ... and the new contract was not signed and we were going to cut off the wires. <br><br>  Nobody remembers that Telecommunications, being a monopoly, approves their tariffs in the anti-monopoly committee and the price will not change.  And the employees of Telecommunications did not understand, apparently, in general, the meaning of the letters of our legal department.  But it was not the funny thing. <br>  The rent price has really increased 3 times, from 100 rubles to 300 (conditionally, I don‚Äôt remember the price exactly, but this is the order). <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt understand much about efficiency issues yet, I just needed to work and not disconnect the bank from communication.  I brought the contract to the vice-president and showed him the amount, said that in the last month we spent so much that we could dig our ditch through the avenue and that it was better to sign everything and forget about the tariff increase 3 times.  The contract was signed in 2 minutes exactly showing its amount.  And I understood this lesson as a lesson, most likely, quite recently, when I myself was faced with the same inefficiency of the work of the lawyers and consultants we hired. <br><br>  Need to learn!  Everyone, and directors and heads of departments and employees. <br><br>  And from time to time it is worth looking at yourself and your work and company a little from the outside and mark the areas in which we successfully produce MUDA, which our customers do not need, and ourselves. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29486/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29486/</a></p>
