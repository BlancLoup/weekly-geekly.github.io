The problem can only consist in the fact that with the conditional presence of a choice there are practically no really iconic models, and only those who appreciate design in mobile devices have absolutely nothing to profit from. <br><br>  HTC Desire SV is the second device of the company, created to fill the segment of high-quality smartphones with two SIM cards.  When creating it, the wishes related to the first-born Desire V were taken into account, and the tendencies of smartphone construction were observed, one of which is a gradual increase in the diagonal of the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/20c/180/95b/20c18095b065505e763a7b29afafaa3b.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you remember, in the Desire V the display was four-inch, whereas the successor has this parameter is already 4.3 inches.  It would seem that quite recently this size was considered flagship, and now it is already quite widespread among the devices belonging to the middle class.  In any case, this did not affect the usability with one hand, and the comfort of the information consumption from the screen increased.  The dimensions of the device are 130 x 68 x 10.7 mm, and the Desire SV weighs 131 grams, being in this respect quite an average smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/252/1a3/009/2521a3009383fed50f782b7782833b27.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f65/6de/9d3/f656de9d341964d8c1b96aebd4738870.jpg"><br><br>  Resolution remains the same, it is 800x480 pixels (WVGA), so that the compatibility of the absolute majority of software can not worry.  In addition, the company traditionally adheres to the technology Super LCD 2, pleasing the user with natural color reproduction.  Viewing angles can not be called a record, but the phone does not claim to be a media player for the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/975/789/85a/97578985a2725bea11f31d382248e9c0.jpg"><br><br>  The display is protected by Gorilla Glass 2 glass, and during the test operation, coupled with carrying in various pockets and compartments of the bag, not even the slightest trace appeared on it.  Capacitive matrix supports up to four simultaneous touches, which should be enough for the absolute majority of users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/83b/bef/aff/83bbefaff2563d12bd95410ea30c8ec7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd0/e49/948/bd0e4994821846af3caac3fd83f9e0e2.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the screen, on the front there are three touch buttons and a large speaker grill, which makes it possible to distinguish the model from the workshop colleagues and other representatives of the line with relative success. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/86c/c93/f75/86cc93f751fda75d33dc3d3a9acc49b5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c2/ff0/a15/4c2ff0a156c518ee44aee12d84373e27.jpg"><br><br>  The location of the controls is absolutely standard, so you do not have to relearn.  On the right is the volume control rocker, the upper end is occupied by a 3.5mm headphone jack along with the power button, but the microUSB port for charging and syncing has finally moved to the lower end, which is good news. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/275/2f5/4e1/2752f54e124a638f0facfc250b9b349d.jpg"><br><br>  The most interesting, as always, "under the hood."  To remove the back cover, made of non-slip matte plastic, it is enough to pry it with your fingers at the top and snap it off along the perimeter.  Your gaze will open two slots for microSIM-cards, located next to the slot for a standard memory card microSD.  In principle, replacing a card with any operator does not cause the slightest problem, but after a much more compact Desire V, equipped with full-sized slots, this picture is a little surprising. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/71b/a02/dcd/71ba02dcd4fd07e2e98021362a6d04ba.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/871/476/de7/871476de7f3ed58cb23ae3558f365c03.jpg"><br><br>  The speaker and the Beats Audio logo on matte plastic are complemented by a camera lens and an LED flash.  Judging by the complete absence of additional protective glass, it is supposed to wipe the ‚Äúpeephole‚Äù with the cover removed, in which case it will be in full view.  As already noted, SV is larger than its predecessor, but it is far from the transition to the category of "spades". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5c4/ac8/933/5c4ac8933a1959ab76fe75e976974258.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dab/906/9b0/dab9069b0da417e43a6b0567feff3f5d.jpg"><br><br>  If you dig even deeper, you can find out the following details: the operability of the device is provided by a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 (MSM8255) dual-core processor operating at 1 GHz.  Paired with him working graphics accelerator Adreno 203. RAM 768 MB, and built-in - 4 GB, from which the user is available by default about half. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f91/406/167/f91406167c44fc7a41048f37b8cd4371.jpg"><br><br>  The subject of the review, perhaps, will not interest fans of flagships and maximum characteristics, but in its category it is one of the most productive solutions.  The results of synthetic tests are shown in the screenshots, and as a comment you can add only positive impressions of the smoothness and speed of the interface and application programs, complain about the "brakes" and reloading the user interface did not have to. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/263/8e8/60c/2638e860c04a614b18af9373da01d81d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f8b/371/b18/f8b371b1877aee17ee4338e4adfcba14.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ced/29f/33c/ced29f33c3ffef3c4a332923543629ea.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c1e/bd3/eb3/c1ebd3eb3c7526b6af62e126627550d1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a58/1a7/297/a581a7297cedaa85886cf453e8a23c50.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/593/c3c/d0c/593c3cd0c4a5189765d422be33cdc75a.png"><br><br>  The default smartphone comes with Android OS 4.0.4 along with an updated proprietary interface Sense 4.1.  We dare to assume that you are familiar with its features, but you have heard about the possibilities of branded add-ons and services of the NTS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/078/e20/b34/078e20b344a84dba50b534721bd72371.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d3/d77/f64/5d3d77f64e535795efab745ae6e53d65.png"><br><br>  Let us dwell only on the implementation of two SIM-cards.  As in the previous model, a clear indication of calls and messages sent from a particular card is provided.  High-speed data transfer supports only one slot, but you can adjust the restrictions on the amount of transmitted traffic for both SIM cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e4/5a2/b5d/3e45a2b5df1af10094a97c8ecaec1368.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/458/e0c/479/458e0c479b5ea7dd4941bbd0200e7e79.png"><br><br>  If both carrier data carriers are installed and active, then two visual call sending keys will appear in the dialer, and in the corresponding settings section you can rename the card by selecting a symbol no more than four characters.  The radio module in the device is one, so when using 3G Internet on the first SIM card and receiving a call to the second session, it will be interrupted.  However, finding devices with two radio modules is still a task, and the issue of power consumption in this case will be particularly acute. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f56/a4b/d04/f56a4bd043625f6c11d2117888c643fd.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/faf/c67/b1d/fafc67b1d24d93a100459785198a2f6f.png"><br><br>  It is expected that all modern interfaces are provided, including Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP profile and support for aptX codec, as well as Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n (and Wi-Fi Direct at the same time).  They are complemented by their proximity, light and position sensors, which allow, among other things, to implement etiquette functions in public places. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f08/b3d/690/f08b3d69060fb65822f21e18d652c3c4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/22c/e83/475/22ce83475d1353d8f8257a7aed0f7b19.jpg"><br><br>  The quality of communication does not cause complaints, the interlocutor is heard well, and the call is difficult to miss.  Similar to other NTS devices, it is enough to take the phone in hand to muffle the ringtone, and to reduce the volume to zero you need to turn the device over. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fd4/e2a/015/fd4e2a0151b4bc8b4903b84c1ab4e425.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e39/978/12f/e3997812f302a29b66fbf0492a1d7630.png"><br><br>  As in Desire V, you have additional options for managing and backing up contact data, including importing them, exporting and transferring from one SIM card to another.  However, it is more convenient to once enter the data into the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù of Google, in order not to worry about the possibility of losing this information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0f5/f84/293/0f5f842938d1964e70491d46efe36c08.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ff/97d/23c/7ff97d23cfc5db27de8845d511e4d6f1.png"><br><br>  Corporate music player has not undergone significant changes and continues to be a convenient way to listen to your favorite music.  In the presence of integration with the popular online services TuneIn Radio and SoundHound, and about the traditional FM-radio that works when you connect the headset, the developers have not forgotten. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/933/62c/135/93362c135ea612afac4884016645cc4b.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/410/4be/242/4104be2426df247cb696c0a41a6803d7.png"><br><br>  To improve the sound profile is provided Beats Audio, which can control the status directly from the notification area.  The sound of the model was evaluated with Klipsch S4a headphones, and the results were very decent, although music lovers will certainly find something to complain about. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/266/ffd/3be/266ffd3bee4552555ad50a1e63f013e7.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ea0/9a8/283/ea09a82839d85cfaa06f60d202c24d43.png"><br><br>  Continuing the conversation about the multimedia component, it is impossible not to mention the camera.  The resolution of the sensor has increased from 5 to 8 megapixels compared to the previous model, and the quality of the images has definitely improved.  Unfortunately, there were certain problems with the sunshine during the testing, but the pictures in the room and under the sky filled with clouds cannot be called a failure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1f5/fe4/8b0/1f5fe48b0a6b79138f061af0f9895e68.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f5/3fc/a9d/9f53fca9d3c2a0646dacb3e62e94786c.png"><br><br>  There is a reverse illumination of the matrix, and the lens aperture is f / 2.2.  The flash is endowed with several levels of triggering, but the best examples are camera samples that you can familiarize yourself with. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ebe/cb7/e99/ebecb7e99b72c3122075a93425e23ab8.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/db8/928/ae5/db8928ae5c9db0d800be9c5aebbabeee.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f4c/7b1/965/f4c7b196553cb5fcf3b70f86ec32c086.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/497/b8a/21b/497b8a21b5ad207b1ae727ea3abe9e3e.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/23a/bbf/ec4/23abbfec4095bd0372b582e5ba3f5342.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a61/bf6/dfc/a61bf6dfc82cdc264dd0955c0875bdc1.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/895/33c/44f/89533c44fd6e0dad962ba118f0f875fc.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/76f/b69/217/76fb69217650cfe3d542692a10235150.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5ae/58f/666/5ae58f666190894b57c4c63e2d70d0d6.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6fb/c1e/861/6fbc1e86192103698f0665b38576e226.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/216/755/c14/216755c14b9c2b85fa5d2a1213362941.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/de0/85a/71c/de085a71c8bd166647dde23ef244d31b.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/32c/92a/c19/32c92ac1926f8066cf4dada07019607f.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The maximum resolution when recording video is limited by the screen settings, so FullHD-video will not be recorded.  As for the quality, you can evaluate its level by reading the example by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DKeoGmeDv5js">reference</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d6a/9b4/d9b/d6a9b4d9b84e3877f72cbb48823c54bc.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ffb/9ca/6de/ffb9ca6de0ffc1ebe4ae7f78c05d3bd3.png"><br><br>  Of the additional features - customizable effects familiar to other devices of the company, HDR and panoramic shooting.  As in the older models, while recording video, you can take photos, but their resolution still does not exceed 800x480 pixels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/49e/bd9/7f8/49ebd97f8655ac31d9cb3dd15a20321e.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/769/b6b/aee/769b6baeef49a7aa611088a812d98297.png"><br><br>  The device copes with the playback of HD 720p video, not to mention the less high-quality material, but to play MKV, as before, you will have to install third-party programs.  The gallery is up to date with the latest cloud trends, and the phone‚Äôs memory is just one of the available sources of content.  Connecting to Dropbox, SkyDrive, Flickr and Facebook is no problem, and Picasa Web Albums are an integral part of your Google account and become available immediately after entering your credentials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cfd/644/f6a/cfd644f6aa65756bf011b87cd838447b.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ecb/473/836/ecb4738361710695a43e7bc7fa41262d.png"><br><br>  The battery has a capacity of 1620 mAh, which can not be called an outstanding value by today's standards.  With average use, including making calls, social networking, along with listening to music and occasional use of the camera, you can always count on a day of battery life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f87/0bf/3af/f870bf3af92c0ef1aacbc2892ead5691.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/08e/0c1/e37/08e0c1e3770cd90ccc1d41f2ccd45ab2.png"><br><br>  Who is this smartphone for?  For those who want a stylish and practical thing with relatively good performance, and most importantly - with two slots for SIM-cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ea1/48e/461/ea148e461c5f759c0c62c90236fa45aa.jpg"><br><br>  The device has no front camera, and the main lens cannot claim to be the creator of masterpieces, but everything you need is provided, and you can use the device right out of the box.  Along with the Google Music client, even the Chrome browser is preinstalled along with a standard browser that has been modified by NTS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/819/855/ce7/819855ce72f1ae02ad391917b975e69e.jpg"><br><br>  The company managed to present to the public a balanced apparatus, finally separated from the budget segment and able to satisfy even the discerning user.  Replacing SIM-cards with smaller format carriers is not difficult, but otherwise this phone is completely ready to work from the very beginning. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165431/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165431/</a></p>
