Emotions have cooled and it's time to share with you useful information. <br><br>  Actually this post is for parents interested in the development of their children in the technical field, heads of circles for young programmers and anyone interested in the topic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a17/362/913/a173629131a84a0b8d9d00eadf080e46">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What happened </h4><br>  We were <a href="https://www.google.com/edu/resources/programs/google-rise-awards/index.html">37 organizations</a> from around the world.  For 3 days we intensively listened to lectures, worked with other projects and stormed.  The original outline is available <a href="http://issuu.com/tbates1621/docs/googlerise_journal_final_singlepage">here</a> .  Among the topics that were touched upon are the involvement of parents in the educational process, the involvement of volunteers, the evaluation of the effectiveness of educational programs, marketing and fundraising, a review of teaching tools. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad1/ec3/0da/ad1ec30dae0d4d0ebf4e9cd49d6d505e.png"><br><br><h4>  Who was </h4><br>  A significant proportion of projects, mainly America and Europe, are devoted to the involvement of girls in IT.  Google generally pays a lot of attention to this topic.  Projects for African Americans.  Well, there is a place to be, given their number of projects dedicated to teaching children to programming in general. <br><br>  To be honest, the educational programs and the approach of all is the same.  Scratch / Blockly, Raspberry, Arduino. <br>  We make games and animations with children.  We play music on bananas and oranges, connected to Raspberry. <br><br>  There were our idols - the company <a href="http://codeclub.org.uk/">CodeClub</a> from the UK.  They teach children to program on Scratch after school hours almost throughout England.  They use the model of corporate volunteering, which we, according to their instruction, will try out ourselves this year.  For several years, they have grown from 0 to more than 2 thousand clubs. <br><br><h4>  Organization </h4><br>  Just know that these beautiful pictures in this publication were made by an insanely talented girl who drew all this in real time with markers in the course of reports and unfolding discussions.  Just a plague!  And I will not even add about breakfast lunches, dinners in the Google office, a boating tour of the Boston Bay and a google bag of sweets, which is given when you check in at Marriot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a89/0ef/836/a890ef836e9544b9a5ae0409886bdd2f.png"><br><br><h4>  Instruments </h4><br><h5>  1. <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/">App Inventor 2</a> </h5><br>  Google revived the MIT App Inventor project.  The bottom line is that you can create Android applications in the visual programming language Blockly.  Form design, write code for events. <br><br>  To watch how it works you need to download the emulator.  Or, by QR code, open immediately on the target Android, after installing the agent (MIT AI Companion) on the device.  In the future, it still works through the agent by the QR-code.  That is, the application itself is stored in the App Inventor cloud. <br><br>  This is a really quick way for kids to create their first app.  It is possible to complete a basic course on Scratch or Code.org and you can try App Inventor. <br><br>  Here's an example calculator :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/809/86e/e7b/80986ee7bd0e4ca4bd6ad5b87445cf05.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b21/87e/a4f/b2187ea4f4204d059d6bc98c5a62fefa.png"><br><br><h5>  2. <a href="http://pencilcode.net/">PencilCode</a> </h5><br>  The tool is positioned as a transition from visual programming to text.  We can switch between visual Blockly and text CoffeeScript.  Inside there are many tasks on the topic of animation, and not only. <br><br>  The project is wonderful and pleasant.  There is a <a href="http://book.pencilcode.net/">book</a> , while in English. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b87/6a4/450/b876a4450a7d4243922fbdfcc4dc43e4.png"><br><br>  And switch to CoffeeScript. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ee/e04/aeb/5eee04aebfb74be3aff392dcd2ce4dda.png"><br><br>  It develops very dynamically.  What we watched in May and what we have now differs dramatically.  Google absorbed the developer and supplied resources so that he would not be distracted from the product. <br><br><h5>  3. <a href="http://cs-first.com/">CS-First</a> </h5><br>  Not so long ago, Google launched its own set of online courses on Scratch.  Before that, they conducted a study on the interests of children and made really very cool thematic courses.  Only 8 directions, 8 lessons in each.  Music, fashion, design, games, sports, art and others.  With video instructions and starting scratch projects.  The code is clean, documented :) <br><br>  For example, a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/28594752">virtual podium</a> for girls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2dd/d3d/cbe/2ddd3dcbeefb4ed8a46a4ee3a25e066e.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/226/016/882/2260168827bd4db58bab5ea49082b839.png"><br><br>  Or <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/46428166/">Dinobol</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/650/02d/a2d/65002da2d1754359b0651d68341cdb28.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a2/d63/38b/7a2d6338bed347d3b7b758db5a5affd4.png"><br><br>  And many others.  The entire list is available <a href="http://www.cs-first.com/materials">here</a> .  We are now building a team for translation. <br><br><h4>  Offtop </h4><br>  There we met with Ammanuel.  He is very reminiscent of the hero from the movie 1 + 1. <br>  Snow-white smiles, the local beer calls colored water, jokes about Putin and the Crimea and teaches Kenya's children to program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/47d/f37/3f1/47df373f13a242f993e567ab9ef0e1a2.jpg"><br><br>  If we haven't covered any areas that are interesting to you, write in the comments, be sure to share. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261093/">https://habr.com/ru/post/261093/</a></p>
