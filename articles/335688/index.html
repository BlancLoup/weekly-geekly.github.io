At first they steal, and when you win, they kill you.</a> <br><br>  The reaction to the first article was very strong.  First, DIT responded to it.  Their representative appeared in the comments, and then the head of the DIT gave a response to the article.  Secondly, the Internet reacted to it.  A large number of media outlets told this story to their readers. <br><br>  In this article there will be an analysis of the answer DIT, a couple of ‚Äúhorror films‚Äù from the side of DIT, the disclosure of the activities of Altarix LLC and 1000 reviews from children and parents.  And yes, I have good news - an application to the FAS has been filed.

I was forced to merge the source code not to an employee of the DIT, but to an employee of Altarix LLC, who are developing my competitor.  Great deed, DIT! <br><br><h3>  Horror ‚Ññ2 </h3><br>  Want another great deed?  DIT found the best application without competition!  <s>Apparently remained a habit from tenders</s> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6b0/55f/2ed/6b055f2ed5d04e7ab58230b04b178681.png"><br><br>  Here they did not even place my application on the site, although I wrote to them about it.  What do children think? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/604/e58/1e7/604e581e760e476aa8d9e3ec53f690c2.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Funny moment: the sum of all tenders related to the EMP is more than 1,000,000,000 rubles!</i>  <i>At the same time, the API of the diary closes with a click of the fingers.</i> <br><br><h2>  Results </h2><br>  In general, it is surprising how, after entering the public field, DIT was frightened and because of this, he changed the reason for disconnecting the API, hiding behind children.  The very fact of the change of the reason already says that the truth is somewhere else, but let's look at the answer? <br><br>  In his response, Yermolaev said that the IPA was disconnected <b>due to advertising</b> , although after that incident with advertising I was unblocked and for <b>8 months</b> there were no complaints from them. <br><br>  He said that <b>this was due to security</b> , although DIT never worried about children simply because the data from the EMP are transmitted via <b>http</b> , the logins and passwords of most children are the <b>same</b> , and in general: the data in the EMP are impersonal. <br><br>  He said that this was due to personal data (assessments), but for some reason, methods that work with fines were left in the EMP, and there is actually real personal information. <br><br>  DIT says about the violation of some points that a huge number of complaints were received because of me, Yermolaev said something even about the court, but why didn‚Äôt I receive a single letter from you?  In my understanding, this means that the complaints are invented. <br><br>  DIT, you say that taxpayers are not willing to pay for the IPA, but let's not make a decision instead of people?  Let us be judged not on the basis of someone‚Äôs separate interests, not on the basis of: ‚ÄúI think so, so the rest think the same way‚Äù, but on the basis of surveys?  You asked people what they want? <br><br>  <a href="https://vk.com/mrkoapp%3Fw%3Dwall-67674677_6090">Here I asked.</a>  <a href="https://vk.com/mrkoapp%3Fw%3Dwall-67674677_6090">And here are 1000 reviews from children and parents.</a>  Can you listen to them? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f10/c37/d1d/f10c37d1d51344c99d9fa0e86f6928c8.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a5c/ae6/626/a5cae662682a4c6a95a9faa16f174a08.jpg"><br><br>  After the first article, DIT had to say that they close all applications altogether, and I even believed in it, but then I came across a post in VK: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ee8/248/eac/ee8248eac67940a3b7a9a8dcb6b23289.png"><br><br>  And it seems to be an ordinary comment, but when you remember that Tactic Labs == Altarix, the meaning is completely different.  A la "do not go far." <br><br><h2>  What else is Altarix doing? </h2><br>  In the last article, I already talked about the site <a href="http://cloud4smartcity.com/">cloud4smartcity.com</a> ( <a href="http://cloud4smartcity.com/">Before</a> your eyes there was the strongest habraeffekt in history! The site not just fell, but also retired) <br>  This site has a neighbor, boomerang.cloud4smartcity.com, on which development is advertised on behalf of FIREGLIDE. <br><br>  Hmm ... FIREGLIDE?  Something familiar ... Exactly!  The LLC TaktikLabs company is owned by LLC FEYRGLAYD. <br><br>  We punch the owner of the cloud4smartcity.com domain and see that it is ‚ÄúAltarix‚Äù LLC.  No questions left. <br><br>  What does FIREGLIDE do?  We find the site <a href="http://fairglide.com/">fairglide.com</a> , which has already been prudently removed.  Here, for example, on one of the pages <a href="http://fairglide.com/smartcity">is sold the application "Gosuslugi"</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a58/9a8/403/a589a8403382424c91ce9457b8fe019d.png"><br><br>  Convenient, yes?  You develop an application for the money of the state, and then sell it several times abroad! <br><br>  Then we find the performance of one of the employees at the GovTech conference: <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;" data-tweet-id="793393928615714817"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br><br>  At the request of ‚Äúfairglide govtech‚Äù we find the <a href="https://www.govtech.co.za/sites/default/files/2016%2520Presentations/2_Govtech16_EkaterinaSolovyeva.pptx">presentation of the same Ekaterina Solovieva</a> .  Here we see a story about the achievements of FairGlide, as the developer of ‚ÄúBOOMERANG PLATFORM: NEW TOOLS TO SCALE YOUR SMART CITY PROJECTS‚Äù.  The presentation says that the application created the application MosRobot, the service "Our City", Active Citizen and "CLEAN CITY SELANGOR". <br><br>  <b>CLEAN CITY SELANGOR</b> is a service created for the city of Selangor, which is located in Malaysia.  Cool? <br><br>  And someone will say: ‚ÄúAltarix is ‚Äã‚Äãa private company, why don‚Äôt they trade in what they have developed?‚Äù, But the only question is that the contracts that Altarix receives <b>occur without competition</b> . <br><br>  This is either the purchase from a single supplier, or the tender is won by OJSC Electronic Moscow (Founder DEPARTMENT OF PROPERTY OF THE CITY OF MOSCOW), but in some way Altarix is ‚Äã‚Äãstill engaged in the development.  And once without a competition, it means that this is the exclusive property of Moscow and no one else. <br><br>  At the same time, yes, it would be great if we could return the money spent on the tender back to the budget, but FairGlide, unfortunately, is not a state-owned company, which means the money received from the cases go somewhere else.  <s>No wonder they clean all their sites?</s> <br><br><h3>  And now what? </h3><br>  And now I would like to know the answer from DIT, and the answer to the whole article, and not an attempt to prove that I am some kind of hacker, marginal and porn baron. <br><br>  1. Opinion DIT on recall of 1000 people <br>  2. Attitude DIT to the activities of Altarix <br>  3. The attitude of the DIT to Taktik Labs LLC. <br><br><h3>  About application </h3><br>  I will not give my application to anyone.  I will fight for him until I sort out all the options that exist at all.  Just because the decision to close is not based on logic, not on a survey of residents, not on technical difficulties, but on the desire to make money. <br><br>  I know that I have a useful project that users love.  I see that 1000 people responded to the simplest post in the VC, which means the truth is on our side! <br>  The best part is that I have support!  Thank you all! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9f3/564/8f5/9f35648f5d8f4117bd326a7770a1c8a7.jpg"><br>  <a href="https://vk.com/wall-29534144_6972855">Via Lentach</a> <br><br><h3>  A spoon of honey in a barrel of tar </h3><br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/plushev">Alexander Plyuschev</a> suggested that the head of DIT meet me on Ekho Moskvy radio.  At the moment, Ermolaev Artyom Valerievich agreed.  The event will occur in early September, I will try to highlight the exact date on Habr√©. <br><br>  Let us hope that they will not give up, as they refused to <a href="http://radio.mediametrics.ru/bezopasnaja_sreda/51832/">meet on the radio Mediametriks</a> , which will pass anyway, but without DIT. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9c0/dff/8a3/9c0dff8a39d64a8d97f31c19d4e16ffe.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335688/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335688/</a></p>
