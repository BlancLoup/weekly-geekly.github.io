      Sincerely yours, <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> full-line operator <br>  ( <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> - turn your online store into a computer game) <br><br>  Finding a new friend is much easier than finding a new customer.  If you need a friend, just go to any stranger, offer to treat him to coffee, chat without any obligations. <br>  Business relationships are full of strained strings, and such an approach as a friendship is not enough.  In the end, it's not just friendship, and much is at stake. <br><br>  How to convince a client to entrust you his money?  There is no specific algorithm for building a client base; there are some universal tips that you can use to expand your list of clients.  For starters, here are seven recommendations for finding more clients: <br><br><h4>  <b>1. Create your own customer base</b> </h4><br>  It sounds weird that you need to narrow the boundaries, because you want to expand your customer base;  but finding your own niche is key to expanding your business.  First, before diversifying the range of its services, you must be able to provide at least one service, but do it very well. <br>  Second, find out what demographic needs your product and services need most and target those needs.  Start by creating marketing persons (an archetypal character created to represent different types of target users for demographic, behavioral, or other characteristics that your site, brand, or product can use), so that knowing the types of customers you are likely to work with , you will target your business and marketing aspirations to them. <br>  It is important to start small, focus on your target audience and gain a strong reputation among your first customers. <br><br><h4>  <b>2. Ask for customer feedback</b> </h4><br>  Speaking of reputation, ask reviews from previous clients to understand where you have strengths and weaknesses.  Customers will appreciate this step in their direction, as an interest in their opinions, and their feedback will help identify the problem areas, as well as the most important strengths of your company. <br>  As part of the process of collecting feedback, ask customers whether it would be difficult for them to share a review about your company, provided that you publish it on the site to promote your product / service.  Eighty-eight percent of consumers trust online reviews more than any personal recommendation, so let your customers convince potential buyers to join the mailing list. <br><br><h4>  <b>3. Share your knowledge</b> </h4><br>  No one likes to share something for free.  After all that time and money spent on creating your product or service, you now realize how much it costs, and you are not going to just share this knowledge. <br><br>  While this may not sound particularly attractive at first glance, the suggestion to use free trial versions or access to certain resources is a great way to get new customers directly, and this can give you a huge payback in the long run. <br><br>  If your clients, for example, are looking for UI designers, then give them the opportunity to understand how you can interview such designers or what the ideal portfolio of such a designer should look like.  This gives potential clients an involvement in the experience of your company, and it will show them that if they pay more, they will get access to information of a much higher quality and level, which, as it seems to them at first glance, is not even needed or they don‚Äôt suspect the existence and necessity of such. <br>  And this strategy applies to any sphere: just let the client swallow the bait, and if he likes it, he will definitely come back for a larger portion. <br><br>  The fact that you share information will not only contribute to the fact that the client looks to your company, but also strengthens your business at the expert level in your industry. <br><br><h4>  <b>4. Reward loyalty</b> </h4><br>  While your intuition will lead to accepting that your attention should be paid to finding new potential customers to increase your base, do not be distracted from existing customers and pay them enough attention.  Sixty-six percent of customers are beginning to use the services of a competitor due to poor service to the original company. <br>  Do not reduce turnover as soon as you begin to receive cash proceeds from customers;  after all, at the end of the day, they can stop using your services at any time.  Instead, reward customers and encourage them to repeat orders, offer discounts, special offers, early access to new products and everything else that will help remind customers that you care about them and want them to stay with you and use your services. <br><br><h4>  <b>5. Treat customers like ordinary people.</b> </h4><br>  Everyone wants to believe that they are that way.  Of course, clients in the first place are just people, and they need to be treated appropriately, but it is not always easy to do so. <br>  It is hard to be patient with a client at the moment when you make ends meet and are engaged only in your own success.  However, it is always worth staying honest and adequate. <br><br>  Since childhood, we remember: ‚ÄúTreat others as you want them to treat you‚Äù - this is true for business relationships too.  Respect your customers, and they will respect you and more than pay for services rendered. <br><br><h4>  <b>6. Interact with the customer via email.</b> </h4><br>  Email is a great marketing tool.  The economic effect of using emails is much higher than from any other digital channel, so use an email list to build a customer base. <br>  Affect the interest of the client by sending him a welcome letter immediately after his subscription, thereby reminding him of your company and what services or products you can offer. <br><br>  However, remember also that your letters are sent only if the client permits to receive letters from you, and must also contain a link to unsubscribe.  Otherwise, your letters will simply be sent to spam (not to mention the legality of this event). <br><br>  And finally, do not forget to make your messages suitable for reading on mobile devices, because according to statistics, 53 percent of emails are viewed from them. <br><br><h4>  <b>7. Give customer access to your network.</b> </h4><br>  If you help clients, they will help you.  One of the ways to do this is to share the thoughts and materials of your other clients with your customers and personally vouch for their quality.  If you are afraid of being unnecessarily intrusive, you can offer features such as hosting, posting information or articles in a guest blog that give customers the opportunity to share their knowledge on relevant topics with your network. <br><br>  This can help your company, because getting more content will allow you to use Rule 80 \ 20 (Pareto Rule: ‚Äú20 percent of efforts yield 80 percent of the result, and the remaining 80 percent of effort - only 20 percent of the result‚Äù): 80 percent of the material that you post should be about abstract things, not about your company and its services. <br>  Using relevant relevant information in your network helps your network stay in trend.  Also, this strategy gives customers the opportunity to share content hosted on your sites with their own audience of the client, which will further increase the coverage of new customers by your company. <br><br>  Building a customer base is crucial to increasing the profits of your business, try using the above tips for this.  With more buyers comes more income, which gives you the opportunity to broader coverage and direction of business in the desired area. <br><br>  Subscribe to our blog, there will be a lot of interesting things further. <br><br>  Sincerely yours, <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> full-line operator <br>  ( <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> - turn your online store into a computer game) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300474/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300474/</a></p>
