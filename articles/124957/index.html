Perhaps, there is nothing more important than its normal working capacity, since without electricity, today's planet and we cannot exist with it.  But, oddly enough, modern energy, studying new ways of generating electricity (solar panels, recovery), uses the architecture of building power grids and methods of analyzing it, originally from the shaggy 90s. <br><br>  Why?  It is possible that until recently it was not possible to efficiently and thoroughly take readings from household meters of consumed electricity and quickly monitor data from the whole city or even the country in the control station of the power station.  But do not try to do this - all the same what to eat on a strict diet and sit all day flicking the remote from the TV, in the hope that the body itself will acquire the desired shape.  It really can do it, but, as we understand, it will be much more effective to pick up a dumbbell. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is the development of such a "dumbbell" that <a href="http://www.emeter.com/">eMeter is engaged in</a> , creating various intelligent and effective solutions in the energy industry, in particular - in your future home.  The company found the right approach to its mission and decided to start with the main thing - with the end user, that is, literally, with us, creating an absolutely new electricity meter.

      How does it differ from the counter with the disk installed in each house or apartment?  Firstly, it is completely electronic.  Secondly, it does an incredible amount of operations, reading the data on the power consumption in your house and sending them to the power station.  What is this amount of data for? <br><br>  It is said that the amount of information produced by the world power network is comparable to or exceeds the amount of data appearing on the Internet - I think you can imagine how unrepresentable this number is.  In the same way as in the case of a diet, there is no point in not trying to use this amount of information as reasonably as possible for the benefit of the user. <br><br>  From the meter installed in your home, the information is read once a month - by you, or by a representative of the company selling you electricity.  It is unlikely that from one such record you can get information about how, for what, at what time of the day you spend electricity.  But this is critical information - if you knew it, you could yourself reduce the consumption of the whole house or apartment.  A power plant could better manage its own tariffs, reducing prices for the consumer. <br><br>  Therefore, the meter from eMeter sends information about what happens to the power grid, every 15 minutes, removing it, on average, every 2 seconds.  Moreover, you, as the owner of such a counter, can follow in real time where your money goes, in the direct meaning of the word.  Thanks to the technologies that were developed by IBM in collaboration with eMeter, you get a virtual picture of power consumption on the Internet. <br><br>  Is this data important?  Without a doubt.  It is the collection of such a volume of information and its subsequent analysis that will make it possible to build electric grids of the future, where not only electricity producers will be responsible for their own actions, but also every person will be able to learn from his own experience what energy is used in his house. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wS6_w0VhE9c&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi5rp4OJan0cWPy94ZfHONkEKRbEg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  IBM not only helps build intelligent products, in this case - energy networks operating on the most modern equipment, but also helps these technologies fall into the hands of the consumer.  So, any large company engaged in the distribution of electricity, can take advantage of this operating time, which is easily controlled and scaled.  The capabilities of the eMeter Smart Grid are, on average, 4 times as high as the most modern industrial standards in the field of building electrical grids, in part this is possible thanks to <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/ru/power/">IBM Power Systems</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124957/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124957/</a></p>
