Universities do not teach web development, web design and internet marketing, at best they are trying to do it, but the results are still poor.  Observing this tendency, we decided to get down to business and start teaching what we know, namely: PHP, Python, Ruby, JS, Internet marketing, e-commerce, IT management, etc. <br><br>  For this important undertaking, we need your help.  Yes, it is yours, the help of each of you is useful.  Firstly, we need volunteer specialists who can provide training and lectures free of charge (both for the teacher and the student), we will provide the technical platform and all the necessary resources for this, and secondly, we will be happy to cooperate with HR ' These are Internet companies and are ready to send our students to you in your regions absolutely free of charge, and thirdly, we will not be prevented from helping us spread information.

      Who cares about the future of the industry, please under the cat.  This education is important! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Why can we learn? </h4><br>  A little background.  We have been studying for a long time, but earlier we did it mainly for our own internal purposes.  A year ago, we had the first free courses on Python / Django, there were two groups for a total of 30 people, of which more than 10 successfully completed the course for 4 months.  We still learn daily. <br><br><h4>  Our concept </h4><br>  We teach practice.  This is the meaning and purpose of our training, each course, each training.  Every day we ourselves work on different projects, big and not so big, for the CIS, for the West and for the East.  We can and are ready to show in our training exactly how we do it, give out professional secrets and even talk about the difficulties that everyone faces in one way or another. <br><br>  The purpose of this kind of practical training is to prepare specialists who can work independently, even in Junior positions or, if the course is not for beginners, but for specialists, to share experience and raise the level of knowledge.  All who are ready to respond to our call will have to follow this principle, and we, of course, will help with this. <br><br><h4>  What are we learning now? </h4><br>  We started with what we know best.  Already worked out several courses and trainings.  The most part is still paid, to be honest, but I hope to find support in Habr's faces and make more free ones. <br><br>  At the moment we have courses and trainings in the following areas: PHP, Python, Ruby, web design, internet marketing, e-commerce.  We are planning to launch soon: business, management, a number of other programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand QA.  It all depends on the wishes that can be expressed below. <br><br><h4>  How to help us? </h4><br>  We have already invested a lot of our own resources in this undertaking, but help will not hurt us.  Namely: <br><br><ul><li>  We are looking for volunteers teachers.  If someone has strong practical knowledge and is ready to teach for free, at least sometimes - you are welcome.  And if you can not only tell, but also write - it is generally wonderful!  I understand that you don‚Äôt go far on a free one, so you can combine a part to make it free, and a paid one, this will allow the market to bring useful knowledge and earn each teacher personally.  In addition, on our part, over time, we will allocate small grants.  With us, a technical platform and advertising, with you an interesting training.  Interested please email: <a href="">info@digitov.com</a> </li><li>  We are looking for HR'ov.  We are ready to send students free of charge (with their consent) and transfer the results of their testing to any interested employer.  You can choose the best.  Interested please email: <a href="">info@digitov.com</a> </li><li>  We are looking for media partners.  If you can help to inform about free courses (trainings), in the media or even in a group on a social network - we will be happy.  Interested please email: <a href="">info@digitov.com</a> </li></ul><br><br><h4>  The first free training </h4><br>  Once we have made this mess, we and the first step to do.  We invite everyone to two free watch training on design (UX / UI) of portals and online stores.  We will conduct in the form of a webinar in several groups of 50 people each.  Trainings will be held December 2-5.  To register, write to: <a href="">info@digitov.com</a> with the subject letter "design training."  Next up are free trainings on Python / Django, PHP / Symfony, Ruby / Ruby on Rails, Internet marketing, web design, QA, and much more. <br><br><h4>  What do you want to learn? </h4><br>  We accept suggestions for new courses and trainings.  Long courses, unfortunately, are rarely done free of charge, but small trainings can easily be conducted free of charge.  Vote or write your comments in the comments.  We will all take into account and emphasize the most demanded and expected. <br><br>  School website: <a href="http://digitov.com/">digitov.com</a> <br><br>  Thanks and hope for support! <br><br>  PS I have already been thrown into tomatoes about the school site.  Actually, we made it "in haste" for the week, so do not judge strictly.  We are already working on a decent modern website, a little patience, everything will be tip-top!  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204204/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204204/</a></p>
