  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Back to the roots": why the IT giant returns 22-nm process technology</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In <a href="https://habr.com/company/it-grad/blog/422501/">one of our materials,</a> we told why manufacturers are increasingly postponing the development of new process technology.  There we mentioned that Intel again postponed the output of 10-nm chips - this time until 2019.  Last month it became known that the company plans to go "further" and <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-14nm-shortage-h310c,37819.html">return</a> to the 22-nm process technology.  Today we decided to discuss the situation, to talk about the reasons for such a decision and about how this can turn out for users. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/it-grad/blog/425781/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_o/am/oz/_oamoziwaxf0cyj3cbclsbdog98.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/130561288%40N04/17708621619/">Fritzchens Fritz</a> PD</i></font> <br><br><h2>  Why did it happen </h2><br>  Intel planned to release chips on the 10-nm process technology in 2016. But over the past two years, the company has <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-cpu-10nm-earnings-amd,36967.html">regularly</a> postponed the release.  Now the release date of the new chips is scheduled for 2019 (and it remains unclear which half of it is).  The company <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3293397/components-processors/intel-says-it-will-finally-have-10nm-pc-processors-by-holiday-2019.html">says</a> that the delay is due to the inability to achieve a high percentage of the output of ready-made processors.

      Despite the fact that the IT giant has thrown all its forces into the development of 10-nm chips, production volumes are growing slowly.  Intel release 10-nm chips in small quantities.  For example, the first Core i3-8121U processors are made on the 10-nm process technology and are already <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3273556/components-processors/intels-first-10nm-cannon-lake-chip-is-a-core-i3-for-notebooks.html">installed</a> in Lenovo devices.  However, the company does not yet talk about large-scale production. <br><br><h2>  How it turned out </h2><br>  The race for the 10-nm process technology led to a <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/14nm-processor-intel-shortage-9000-series,37746.html">shortage of</a> 14-nm processors on the market.  PC makers who counted on 10nm devices were forced to purchase more 14nm solutions.  The IT giant's production lines were unable to meet growing demand. <br><blockquote>  As a result, processor prices began to rise.  Resident Reddit <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Dx5hYp1">has calculated</a> that in recent months, one of the German retailers, the cost of Intel processors has increased by 25% (third graph). </blockquote>  Intel has had an impact on the situation and on the supply of cellular modems for Apple.  In particular, the latest models of the iPhone - XS and XS Max - <a href="https://3dnews.ru/975801">have</a> Intel PMB9955 <a href="https://3dnews.ru/975801">modems</a> , which are implemented on the 14-nm process technology.  Considering that Apple <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-many-iphones-have-been-sold-1999500">sells</a> millions of new smartphones annually, Intel‚Äôs production facilities have been heavily loaded. <br><br>  The problem with the shortage of chips <a href="https://habr.com/company/it-grad/blog/337630/">immediately reflected</a> in the alignment of forces in the market of processor manufacturers: Intel and AMD.  In June, the share of AMD <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/intel-chip-supply-woes-amd-ryzen-sales-september-etailer">was equal to</a> 45%, in August - already 51%, setting the number of sold CPUs at a record high.  Intel's failures can also affect the market as a whole. <br><br>  JP Morgan analysts <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/14/jp-morgan-says-intels-chip-shortage-is-worsening-and-will-hurt-pc-sales.html">say a</a> 14nm shortage could cut PC sales by 7%. <br><br>  Intel is already working out ways out of the situation.  In particular, the company has <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/supply-update/">invested</a> another billion dollars in the production of 14-nm chips, and also came up with a temporary solution. <br><br><h2>  What will do </h2><br>  Intel has <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-14nm-shortage-h310c,37819.html">decided to</a> return to the 22-nm process technology.  With the use of this process will be released chipset H310C.  This should help to redistribute the load on production capacity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a8/k-/ve/a8k-ven74kb4g9dxwljfshoysmw.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="">Jpogi</a> <a href="">CC</a></i></font> <br><br>  Plus, this will allow "to ease financial pressure" on the budget of the IT giant, since the cost of producing 22-nm microcircuits is significantly less than 14-nm.  In Gartner, it is <a href="https://semiengineering.com/22nm-process-war-begins/">estimated</a> that designing a chip using a 14nm process technology costs $ 80 million, and using a 28nm process costs $ 30 million (22nm is likely to be a bit more expensive). <br><br><h2>  Effects </h2><br>  The production of 22nm chipsets will allow the company to regain market share.  These devices will cost less and, as the manufacturer claims, <a href="https://semiengineering.com/22nm-process-war-begins/">will not lose much</a> in performance.  Therefore, they are quite able to become a temporary alternative to the 14-nm for office and home PCs. <br><br>  Note that when Intel announced that they could still supply the required number of chips and satisfy the demand, AMD shares <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/28/amd-shares-plunge-after-intel-says-it-can-meet-its-guidance.html">fell</a> by 5.2%, while Intel shares rose by 3.1%.  In addition, according <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/supply-update/">to</a> Acting Intel CEO Bob Swan (Bob Swan), the company has enough power to regain its position in the market before the end of the year. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>PS We also write about IaaS and not only in our <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog">Telegram channel</a> :</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/164">How to handle PD in Russia and Europe</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/163">What is there in VMware: three new items</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/126">IaaS for amusement parks</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425781/</a></p>
