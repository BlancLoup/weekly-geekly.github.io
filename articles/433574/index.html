  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Headphone Review Sony SBH90C: Wireless or USB Type-C?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m8/ox/pr/m8oxprskwnot6kpnrlbomrijkfq.jpeg"><br><br>  The widespread rejection of the 3.5 mm headphone jack broke smartphone users into two camps: some were unhappy that they would have to make compromises in terms of sound quality and charge another device, others enthusiastically accepted this change, appreciating the more monolithic design of the devices and the convenience of the wireless connect.  The most advanced even fantasize about the possible rejection of wired charging, but this still seems to be a too radical change in user experience.  A compromise between the two opposing sides was found in the Sony SBH90C headphone model - you can use them via Bluetooth or connect a wire to listen to high-resolution audio. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nq/qz/q7/nqqzq7tdchv0fi-2avpyolmm3ks.jpeg">

      While walking or using public transport, you should prefer the Sony SBH90C wireless connection and get all the advantages of wireless headphones in terms of ease of use, and in a quiet environment at home or office you should choose a USB Type-C connection to listen to Hi-Res Audio.  In addition, with a wired connection, the headphones will start charging, which means they will always be ready to work via Bluetooth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3t/hp/c6/3thpc6wull-uojafmj5xi-pcnpm.jpeg"><br><br>  In terms of design, the Sony SBH90C is a classic neckband model.  This made it possible to make the headphones themselves compact (no problems with glasses or a cap) and at the same time put batteries of sufficient capacity.  The stated work time is up to 7.5 hours of listening to music or up to 9 hours of talk time.  However, the actual autonomy is even higher, if we talk about the average volume level.  It takes 2 hours to fully charge the battery, regardless of whether the Sony SBH90C is connected to a smartphone, computer, or power adapter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kq/ug/_u/kqug_uz-sz89_aqc5baixn2ce90.jpeg"><br><br>  Buyers can choose one of two colors: classic black or soft beige.  The headphone case is made of soft-touch silicone, and the headphones themselves also have shiny chrome accents.  The exterior of the Sony SBH90C is versatile, they look stylish and at the same time do not pay an excessive amount of attention to themselves - they will look equally good with casual clothes, business attire and even extravagant street fashion.  The neck rim itself is quite soft and flexible, in combination with a small weight (about 27 grams), this makes it almost impossible to feel the headphones during use.  Another convenient solution is headphone magnets that help avoid tangling of wires when the headset is not in use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nq/qz/q7/nqqzq7tdchv0fi-2avpyolmm3ks.jpeg"><br><br>  The controls are spaced apart on both sides of the rim: the right is the power button and the NFC module to quickly create a pair, the left are the volume buttons and the start or stop key.  By the way, the play / pause button is tactilely different, which allows you to avoid erroneous clicks, such as lowering the volume instead of answering the call.  The left side of the rim also contains a USB Type-C connector for charging or wired music.  Due to the non-slip matte silicone, the rim fits securely around the neck and there is no feeling that the cable pulls the headset to one side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xm/ty/qv/xmtyqvwtg4pvdotdh_kwjkrl88y.jpeg"><br><br>  The Sony SBH90C uses 9.7 mm drivers.  Frequency characteristics - 20‚Äì40 000 Hz (USB Audio), 20‚Äì10 000 Hz (Bluetooth).  Normal impedance is 22 ohms (1 kHz).  With wireless connection (Bluetooth 4.2), SBC, AAC, Qualcom aptX audio is supported, with USB Audio there is support for audio up to 192 kHz / 24 bit.  Quality assessment is always very subjective, and each student has his own ideas about how to play the "right" headphones.  However, we can say that the Sony SBH90C is a universal model that is suitable for any genre without inclination to certain areas.  Headphones of this class sound equally well as tops of streaming services, as well as complex compositions that it makes sense to include in Hi-Res Audio format.  Thanks to the Sony SBH90C's in-channel design, they have good passive sound insulation, and in combination with a good volume margin, this avoids problems with distracting outside sounds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ji/tn/o1/jitno15g91tumm2nsolwhqt73ok.jpeg"><br><br>  Sony SBH90C is a great model for two categories of customers at once.  Firstly, it will be easier to get used to the distribution of wireless audio and gradually forget about the 3.5 mm headphone jack, and secondly, they are suitable for those who are not willing to spend money on two Bluetooth models for outdoor use and Hi-Res support. Audio over the wire to listen to music in a relaxed atmosphere. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433574/">https://habr.com/ru/post/433574/</a></p>
