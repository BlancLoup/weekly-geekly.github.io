      Those of you who follow the news of mobile technologies, surely know that everything is fine with us, the work is in full swing, and we are full of interesting ideas and a desire to implement them (sometimes even despite the dissatisfaction of engineers and technologists). <br><br>  For those who have dropped out of the rhythm and devoted themselves completely to tracking news about political events in the country and the world, we will briefly tell you what happened to us since our last airing: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e2/5cb/536/1e25cb536ea555cbe57d52737698edca.jpg"><br><br>  1. Last December, sales of the first generation YotaPhone started. <br>  Information about where it can be viewed live (and immediately purchased) is on <a href="http://yotaphone.com/">this page</a> .  If you are ready to purchase it without looking / stroking (or looking / stroking it before and perfectly imagine how good it is), then you can use our <a href="http://shop.yotaphone.com/">online store</a> . <br><br>  2. At Mobile World Congress 2014, we announced the second generation of the YotaPhone.  One of the key differences from the previous smartphone was that now the second screen has become a touch screen and allows you to write SMS, answer calls and perform other usual actions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10a/254/887/10a2548878952b287ed8c9b3c6ef3d5d.jpg"><br><br>  The device will receive a quad-core processor with a capacity of 2.3 GHz and two cameras - an eight-megapixel with LED flash, and two-megapixel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d78/464/b10/d78464b105b909bd7e9af02effd841e4.jpg"><br><br>  The amount of RAM YotaPhone is 2 GB, the amount of internal memory - 32 GB. <br><br>  Rozetked prototype video review: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLoIXL-Ru8Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi_CFyJgTnXzlhBOwiRm_SImZoGdg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We tried to take into account all the comments that were voiced by our users (and also to the audience, for which we thank you all so much), and made the device such that many journalists and bloggers who visited our booth at MWC 2014 called YotaPhone the new generation the best, what they saw at the show. <br><br>  Here is an incomplete list of ‚Äúunlocked games‚Äù: <br><br>  - The most innovative product version of Computer Bild. <br>  - The best product on the show according to Expert Review. <br>  - The best innovation at the MWC 2014 exhibition according to the version of Laptop Magazine. <br>  - The best product on display by Tom's Guide. <br>  - The best product on display by Tom's Hardware. <br>  - The best product on display in the PC Mag version. <br><br>  3. We are well aware that a good prototype that everybody likes is one, and a commercially successful product that has become a favorite phone for millions of people around the world is another.  And between these two ‚Äúcheckpoints‚Äù there is a lot of work, not only to refine the ‚Äúiron‚Äù component, but also to polish the software part.  And the ultimate goal of these efforts is to make the user enjoy not only tactile, but also emotional. <br><br>  Therefore, we launched YotaPhone SDK (you can familiarize yourself with it here: <a href="http://developer.yotaphone.com/docs/getting-started/building-your-first-app/">http://developer.yotaphone.com/docs/getting-started/building-your-first-app/</a> ) and invite Android application developers to extend the capabilities of their applications using E -Ink screen.  We promise that ‚ÄúHelloWorldOnBackscreen‚Äù will give you almost as much pleasure as you received from your first ‚ÄúHelloWord‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88f/1b7/dd3/88f1b7dd34352e0fadde68bb7857ae36.png"><br><br>  We continue the incredibly interesting work on the YotaPhone of a new generation and promise to share with you all what we are living now - namely, reflections on mobile information security, advances in the development of E-Ink technology, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25CA%25EB%25FD%25E9%25F2%25F0%25EE%25ED%25E8%25EA%25E0">cleatronics</a> , design, cloud computing, quantum psychology etc. <br><br>  Well, for sweets - we invite you to the YotaPhone Idea Camp conference, which will be held tomorrow at the Garage Education Center ( <a href="http://ideacamp.yotaphone.com/">Moscow, Gorky Park</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e40/7ed/76a/e407ed76a2e93e84a2ed616774feca6b.jpg"><br><br>  On it we: <br><br>  - we will tell about how work on the next generation of our smartphone is progressing; <br>  - we learn from you and other guests what you would like to see in it; <br>  - we will discuss trends in mobile technologies; <br>  - we will listen to the opinion of world experts; <br>  - we will hand over our smartphone to the author of the most interesting idea; <br>  - let's talk informally at a party. <br><br>  Read more at <a href="http://ideacamp.yotaphone.com/">http://ideacamp.yotaphone.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217163/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217163/</a></p>
