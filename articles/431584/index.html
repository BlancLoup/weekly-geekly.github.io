Other people's mistakes are an experience that can be both exciting and rewarding.  And finally, recently there have been several cosmic accidents with completely IT reasons.  Therefore, I decided to speak at the SQADays 24 testers conference with a story about what testers can learn from astronautics.  And since the other activities of the same trip for a separate publication are too small, a vinaigrette from: <br><br><ul><li>  My SQADays report </li><li>  The best reports SQADays-24 </li><li>  Video reconstruction of the accident "Union MS-10" with instructions on how to repeat it at home </li><li>  Some photos of the pavilion "Cosmos" at VDNH </li><li>  Visit to Laba.Space, where the 435nm project is located </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/of/it/k1/ofitk1fnhgfjf7wp-rr8w3hufmi.jpeg"><br>  <i>Illustration by Alfred Kelsner</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  SQADays </h2><br>  The conference was held on November 23-24, and the organizers not only managed to process the video, but also posted it in public access. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/303144833" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In more detail about the given examples in the following publications:

Video <a href="https://vk.com/video-68365367_456239107">link</a> . <br><br>  Orbiter is available for free, you can install add-ons and see the crash scripts shown. <br><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://www.orbiter-forum.com/download.php">Orbiter 2010</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.orbithangar.com/searchid.php%3FID%3D6907">Ship "Union"</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.orbithangar.com/searchid.php%3FID%3D5126">Ship "Vostok"</a> </li></ol><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/428530/">The cause of the accident "Union MS-10."</a> <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Walk on the pavilion 'Space' ENEA</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> It happened by chance that the last time I ended up in Moscow just a day before the official opening of the restored pavilion "Cosmos", so now, naturally, I decided to spend a free evening to go there.  On Habr√© there is a report from the month of April, so you can see what has changed in six months. <br><br>  General view of the pavilion from the entrance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uf/1k/dk/uf1kdkby_eevf6kdcal97dmkv64.jpeg"><br><br>  The dawn of the Soviet cosmonautics - GIRD missiles and the first engines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tz/so/um/tzsoumotlcfq8lai3up8c0oxykq.jpeg"><br><br>  A rarer exhibit is the payload of a suborbital geophysical rocket.  Climbed into space for a few minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7o/ta/b3/7otab39ahxfqxpagi4zasvktuai.jpeg"><br><br>  The pavilion was created with the participation of the Polytechnic Museum, the strength of which are interactive stands, here they also exist, and of very good quality.  This is the ‚Äúprepare to go into space‚Äù quest, which is rather long and complicated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1c/sg/up/1csgupaj8mlcj3vd5r5y8irvdmi.jpeg"><br><br>  And this is almost a real space simulator.  Moving forward is automatic, but the roll and offset along two axes must be controlled independently.  Great stand! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/90/se/_o/90se_oq2wqmqxkdqbimgond34f0.jpeg"><br><br>  But the idea with the exhibits in the drawers I did not really like.  Children may be curious, but the need to constantly push and pull drawers personally quickly began to annoy me.  Plus, they are slowly starting to get loose, I'm afraid it will be worse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j6/jb/kq/j6jbkqijgdjieyxxc3xwswo0ixc.jpeg"><br><br>  A very relevant exhibit is the mast of the emergency rescue system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l8/qn/1h/l8qn1hmfcshxp0rr7-2pvvd7_xa.jpeg"><br><br>  Around the middle of the hall, the engines NK-43 and NK-33. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w1/o-/5y/w1o-5ytg0e5sni7rqg4zfzhamey.jpeg"><br><br>  Side hall, very conceptual huge astronaut.  For some reason, I remember a giant child from Solaris, which is not very pleasant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iu/fe/x2/iufex2b9ocn_qmrfrpkgolhnzey.jpeg"><br><br>  Top of the far side of the room.  Satellites, right GLONASS-K. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a9/dx/ox/a9dxoxpqasnt44diti6_tatvzji.jpeg"><br><br>  Layout MCC, an interesting idea. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_i/l1/0f/_il10feeg1xezxmzl3zv8s8s_9e.jpeg"><br><br>  The restored dome in the far part of the hall is very beautiful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/45/bm/qq/45bmqq-_v1g-kc7xkp3ianclij4.jpeg"><br><br>  "And the whole world is not enough". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z_/dn/nt/z_dnntl5a-x5vnuz7tgedprjw1k.jpeg"><br><br>  Robot Fedor.  That's right, let it be not only history, but also structures that have not yet managed to fly.  Photos from the side, because in front of him a constant line of people willing to talk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gn/22/ce/gn22ceprlocg5g1okkd-7z__nea.jpeg"><br><br>  View from the far end of the hall towards the entrance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t8/n9/qd/t8n9qdqvvurnq-smr6l0vqqyvna.jpeg"><br><br>  On a dais fantastic pictures and acting ion engines.  You can't take it from me! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/20/xn/ua/20xnuatv83xdlt1pltchvy7ee2a.jpeg"><br><br>  On the left of the entrance are historical spacecraft - "Mars", "Venus", "Lunokhod". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yu/nw/ez/yunwezjcoi8ai1g3qq3t21cnvma.jpeg"><br><br>  On the right hand spacesuit ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c9/ir/ys/c9irysvhgr6m1ve44rtypzraw1q.jpeg"><br><br>  And rockets.  Family "Angara". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9j/zp/-m/9jzp-mni6-fpkcqnkhos3xd-kng.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/64/gy/kg/64gykgz_ffqtaeysuggnbr3t6ug.jpeg"><br><br>  And the legendary family of "sevens" from the ballistic "R-7" to, suddenly, "Union-5". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kv/q3/cv/kvq3cv6w10siboijakxg_pe4xni.jpeg"><br><br>  The fact that the pavilion is open not so long ago still makes itself felt.  This is the most outrageous mistake that has not yet been corrected.  Wrong signatures from "Angara" and "Soyuzov", while curiously, the paint was written correctly, "carrier rockets". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mr/yx/qc/mryxqcms0m-ebm2gwuqhhdyqxg8.jpeg"><br><br>  I went to the caretakers, asking if they often complain about this mistake.  The answer is that yes, and that it is not the only one.  A whole commission arrived, made a list, but the inaccuracies have not yet been fixed.  Still, they say, on the left there is a mock-up of Lunokhod-2 with a sign Lunokhod-1.  Well, let's hope that the errors are corrected. <br><br>  In general, I liked the pavilion, VDNH now became the most museum-space site of the country, do not be lazy, take a walk around the Museum of Cosmonautics, and the pavilion "Cosmos". <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Project news 435nm</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Alexander Shaenko, who successfully gathered crowdfunding to the Mayak satellite, launched a new 435nm project in the spring.  He wants to get a life-support system closed in oxygen.  In March, Alexander successfully raised crowdfunding funds for work and was about to set up a ‚Äúdeath experiment‚Äù in the fall - breathing oxygen that chlorella produces.  Alas, as is often the case, the deadlines were estimated too optimistically, and winter is already on the nose, and the experiment will have to wait a long time - chlorella is still growing poorly, and the ‚Äúiron‚Äù is not ready. <br><br>  This is how the Chlorella test bench looks like so far. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j2/y7/a0/j2y7a0hasea29gdum9jfm1ttxts.jpeg"><br><br>  Alexander Shaenko and breathing mask. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2t/iz/qh/2tizqhmpltizdxlce_oiqok60c8.jpeg"><br><br>  The works are carried out in the Laba.Space space, a very geeky place, with an entrance through a rusty fence near a garbage can, a passage through capitally repaired premises and a set of appropriate equipment located in the basement - 3D printers, milling machines, laser cutting machines, and even a pressure chamber, which is why something stubbornly do not want to call a pressure chamber. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ly/h4/ti/lyh4tiektr4m5a-5qphgoowwxgq.jpeg"><br><br>  Work on the project is underway, so that, if not as soon as we would like, we will most likely see a working reactor that gives oxygen for breathing. <br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431584/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431584/</a></p>
