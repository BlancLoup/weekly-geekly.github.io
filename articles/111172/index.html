I also immediately noticed that JunOS is based on FreeBSD, and this inspired hope for virtualization.

    <h4>  All ingenious thought up to me </h4><br>  I did not immediately think about going to the official site of the GNS3 project, and it was idle for me there that Q (J) EMU, included in GNS3, allows <i><b>‚Äú... Cisco IOS Juniper or to check configurations that need to be deployed later on real routers ‚Äù</b></i> . <br>  I decided to check the above statements. <br>  I download the full GNS3 package, install and see before me the familiar graphical environment.  In node types, you can observe (previously unnoticed by me) Juniper router.  Drag it to the topology window and: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/0f/b3/0fb35faaf63aabb8c4313d519b1ca8cb.png" alt="image"><br>  Of course, if everything worked right away, well, it was not at all interesting. <br>  Well set up. <br>  Interested point <b>Binary image</b> .  Google  As expected, this is an OS image (more precisely HDD) for QEMU.  Immediately there were several articles on the self-build ‚ÄúJunOS over FreeBSD‚Äù (as I collected my image I will tell you next time). <br>  I want to mention the project Olive, it is the initial attempt to run JunOS on a regular PC (more details in the links). <br><br>  And so while we use ready-made way.  Just want to dwell on the choice of version of JunOS.  Version 9.3 is interesting for me, in view of the work of real pieces of iron at work on it. <br><br>  And so Here we found the image according to the description that suits us: <br>  - Image for QEMU <br>  - JunOS version 9.3 <br>  - Login / Password Details <br><br>  This is how our configuration will first look like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/1f/db/1fdb15b31a8ebb2bab2f192ebeb5749e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, let's assemble a simple test stand: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/bf/3f/bf3ffc58fd3397427b1def72b4ed514f.png" alt="image"><br>  As a second router, I use my favorite 7200 chassis. <br>  We set ourselves a simple task to connect between two routers with a network of 192.168.0.0/24 and ping from both sides in order to fully ensure success.  And so we will launch the stand. <br>  We have a QEMU window: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/70/2e/702e3f4bca365681e6534784a38fd7f4.png" alt="image"><br>  Go to it and click. <br>  And we begin to wait.  Now loading our virtual machine. <br>  Visually, one can only observe the inscription: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e9/87/e987c1b2c99002aca122c85b99a0ecc7.png" alt="image"><br>  As a result, we will see a greeting for the login and password.  We enter and get into the FreeBSD console: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/eb/7a/eb7aaefd24296b6e7c8bb6c7cbaa0174.png" alt="image"><br>  Perform <b>top</b> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/3a/96/3a96e48a6eb9707a1d916eba7176cc7c.png" alt="image"><br>  But let's not get distracted by JunOS, run <b>cli</b> and we can see the classic prompt, execute <b>sh ver</b> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/4e/08/4e08cd11e25dbcee4b4b3258d63848fa.png" alt="image"><br>  Here we have successfully launched JunOS.  We proceed to the setting. <br>  First, let's see the list of available interfaces. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/31/d7/31d75fea1e95662cd39302a84d9278d3.png" alt="image"><br>  Fine.  We have <b>em</b> interfaces (these are our Virtual Intel 1000e Pro NICs). <br>  View the port status of <b>em0</b> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/fe/19/fe19ad17dc03f713389327f79913b1a8.png" alt="image"><br>  The interface is up.  Full-duplex 1Gb / s, MAC is present. <br>  Now you can register the address to fulfill our goal. <br>  Go to configuration mode: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/8a/24/8a249ac3045ea83e79e766e2931f4ccc.png" alt="image"><br>  Perform: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c3/06/c306bdf71d6c3c7aa3cec96147d9d828.png" alt="image"><br>  Once again, let's see what we did and check the candidate version: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/24/dc/24dcdcf7bbdecb03dbbde97a5ef2af04.png" alt="image"><br>  And apply the configuration: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/63/d7/63d73176585d86a96812edaddbdf4f5e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's exit configuration mode and ping a Cisco72xx node (192.168.0.1/24). <br>  The process of configuring interfaces on IOS is well described and I omit it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/57/60/5760fe20865ae8792a675829590253b6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And on the reverse side of Cisco72xx (192.168.0.1/24): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/9e/19/9e19ab9ab2357b660f3d34539313e15e.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br><br>  As a result, we have achieved our goal: <br>  - JunOS virtualization <br>  - primary setup <br>  - successful simple check <br><br>  A couple of words about virtualization.  Juniper solutions are hybrid in nature and some of the calculations are performed hardware in special modules (typical of the MX / M / T series of routers), so there will be a number of problems in the implementation of certain things on our stand. <br><br>  But I haven‚Äôt mentioned the J series yet, it‚Äôs considered ‚Äúprogrammatically‚Äù and if you assemble a stand on it, then many difficulties can be overcome. <br><br>  <i>This is a trial article with pictures about the initial stage, I have a desire to make a cycle of articles and consider different issues from typical CE-PE schemes for BGP / VPLS, MPLS PE-PE and, of course, consider a policer, etc.</i> <br><br><h4>  Links </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.juniper.net/ru/ru/">Juniper Networks official website</a> <br>  <a href="http://juniper.cluepon.net/Main_Page">Juniper Clue wiki</a> <br>  <a href="http://juniper.cluepon.net/index.php/Olive">About Olive</a> <br><br>  <b>UPD: Corrected with the review / image ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/torin666/" class="user_link">Torin666</a> remark)</b> <br><br>  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111172/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111172/</a></p>
