  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As NASA with Roskosmos to be friends banned</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some day today in the space program that words containing the letters ‚ÄúP‚Äù and ‚ÄúC‚Äù come to mind.  Electro-L got sick, and here the State Department also forbids NASA to be friends with Roscosmos.  The number of comments, under the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/218079/">news</a> , as if hints that this question is of concern to many. <br><br>  Upd: <a href="http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/news/2014/04/04/n_6059641.shtml">it turns out the</a> State Department did not prohibit, and the ban came from the administration of NASA. <br><br>  I'll try to clarify a little on my part, since I took up the space program.  Moreover, I recently <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/216695/">raised a</a> related topic.

To close it because of some political squabbles is the height of recklessness.  It can not be frozen either - it will fall.  Therefore, we pull together. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55e/6ad/2b1/55e6ad2b18a248b2211b0f6dcc6e1a68.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Deliveries of rocket engines are also not folded.  First, in the US, engines have already been delivered until 2017.  Secondly, I know how Habr√© is loved by the private space company SpaceX, but the United Launch Alliance (Lockheed Martin and Boeing), Orbital Sciences, Sierra Nevada Corporation and others are also private companies.  Therefore, any bans on the relationship of state officials - they are completely up to the lantern.  Perhaps such a ban may affect the conclusion of future contracts that will require the participation of government representatives.  But so far, there has been nothing heard about such negotiations, and if they are conducted on the sly, then no one will know that the State Department ban has been violated.  And no one forbade meeting in the neutral zone.  A bunch of aerospace salons and conferences are being held around the world, where everyone can go and calmly agree on anything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a7/f32/e9c/5a7f32e9c92f14cdeeb63d4645c86920.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The joint study of Mars and the Moon also does not stop and does not stop. <br><br>  Everything is very simple: scientists are not officials.  Nobody forbade them to cooperate and communicate.  Yes, even if I tried to do it, something tells me that they didn‚Äôt really obey.  The Russian rover drivers, being in Moscow, both drove Curiosity and drive (or, more precisely, fire Mars with neutrons).  Russian nuclear physicists, as studied Mars and the Moon from an orbit, and study. <br><br>  And another such moment: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which deals with the management of NASA interplanetary vehicles, is also a commercial organization.  Therefore, the ban on them, too, does not apply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/497/71b/b18/49771bb18b0354a80580639c4799e7b5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/184662/">Radioastron</a> ‚Äù is the same. <br><br>  Upd: explanation from the head of the scientific program of the Radioastron project Yury Yuryevich Kovalev: <br><br><blockquote>  NASA came out of all the "Spectra" many years ago ... <br>  Now the situation is changing slowly. <br>  And, for example, for RadioAstron, for the last six months I have been working to get NASA‚Äôs 70-meter DSN antenna at Goldstone to observe with RadioAstron, as one of many ground-based telescopes.  With this, I expect, nothing will come of it because of the latest decisions of the State Department, and the consequences for NASA.  But since they (Goldstone) have not yet begun to work with us, accordingly, this cannot be called a loss either. <br><br>  Two more NASA antennas from DSN work with us at Robledo &amp; Tidbinbilla (Spain).  But they want this on account of their (national) time, and NASA should not be concerned with this. <br><br>  Our contract tracking station at Green Bank (US) has nothing to do with NASA. <br><br>  Our interactions with other foreign ground-based telescopes (Japan, Australia, Korea, China, Europe, USA, etc.) operate on the principle of scientific collaborations and the symmetric principle of open skies (open access to observational time for everyone through the call for proposals).  It is precisely because we have built our work on this principle, and not on the principle of political interaction between countries, so far I do not see any negative consequences of recent known events. </blockquote><br><br>  Those.  as I said before: current bans could affect negotiations on any future joint projects.  But I have not heard of such.  Now we have much more agreements with Europe, for example, on the same ExoMars or JUICE.  The European Space Agency is much calmer in the current situation.  Russia for EkzoMarsa two rockets to Mars promised at their own expense, ESA is unlikely to refuse such a gift. <br><br>  The situation as a whole is ugly, but IMHO is a purely demonstrative gesture, such as last year‚Äôs <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/196054/">NASA outage</a> . <br><br>  Upd1: Although <a href="http://zelenyikot.livejournal.com/34578.html%3Fthread%3D2866194">there are</a> less optimistic points of view. <br>  Upd2: And <a href="http://zelenyikot.livejournal.com/34578.html%3Fthread%3D2859538">more</a> .  It seems that the situation will not significantly affect the fundamental programs, but by education and joint conferences, it‚Äôs not for fun. <br>  Upd3: <a href="http://mursic.livejournal.com/67844.html">another opinion</a> from the other side. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/218183/">https://habr.com/ru/post/218183/</a></p>
