      The bottom line is this.  In my second half at work I began to blunt the laptop immensely, well, like, the registry is dirtied, what virus could it, etc.  About a year ago, she turned to me with a request to help “fix” her working computer, the computers of her colleagues.  I did it a couple of times, dropping on the way home from work to my spouse's office and spending all of an hour or two on everything.  Well, I took the computer once home, when I had to save everything and rearrange the Windows.  I was offered money for these services by my boss, but I’ve been embarrassed lately to take money from mine.  Why your own?  Well, just my girlfriend works in a small-scale agency where informal relations reign, all with everyone for a particular “you”, including me;  more than once they drank with them on holidays, were hanging out, well, it was somehow embarrassing for me to take money for a simple job. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But I didn’t always want to mess with their (my wife’s desk) office equipment.  Then somehow (about half a year ago) they called for some kind of “computer help", which smashed them up to 4000 rubles.  (it seems) for reinstalling the blue-eyed Windows.  I, of course, prefigel from the prices, but it was still flowers. <br><br>  Berries were yesterday, when my faithful again began to die computer.  He calls and says: “Well, I can’t work, the computer will be repaired again.”  I was still kidding: “Again for 4 thousand?”.  “No,” he says, “for a thousand!”  Well, I think, okay.  Will come and quickly make a thousand.  Although, if she had voiced at least the same 4 thousand, I would suggest, nevertheless, do everything myself and take a couple of thousand.  They (the firm of them) pay money anyway, so, I think, it’s okay that I would take a couple of thousand - and so it is twice cheaper than “computer help”. <br><br>  “10,000 rubles today the repair is out” - my betrothed declares to me last night.  “Dooooooooooooooooo?” I asked and swelled the amount.  Well, he says, he had a price list with him (“aha,” I say, I can print them to the printer for you, these price lists ”), which means: bykap letters from Outlook - 2000. Reinstalling Windows - 4,000. Recovering letters from backup is 2000. Antivirus is 500 - 1500 rubles and, attention, <i>“installing Punto Switcher is 500 rubles, Adobe Flash Player is 500 rubles,”</i> etc. <br><br>  Well, mine, of course, is not a complete kettle, it looks at him and says, you, they say, keep it up with all the idiots with Punto Switcher and Player (yes, there was also a winamp offered for 500 rubles).  He smiled, they say, well, you can do it yourself.  At the same time he bred in black: they say, you have a nontrivial case here, it is impossible to “backup” letters “regularly”, and then “it was impossible to“ deploy ”regularly…  Final amount: 17,000 Russian rubles!  This is one departure per day to gullible clients - GESTURE! <br><br>  I, 10 years ago (in my 15 years), also ran the computers, set up, but I had a conscience on the spot and I did not dilute anyone. <br><br>  And here are the goons, sorry, stupid no conscience.  Yes, a person may not understand what a computer is and what to do with it (not all of them IT professionals), but repairing such chaos ...
