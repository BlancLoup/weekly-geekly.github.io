Go to the goal, work in the right direction, show the world that this is important to you, and it will respond. <br><br>  I am writing this post on board the Moscow-Zurich aircraft at 16:40, March 16, 2010.  I treat an event that should have happened more than 4 months ago. <br><br>  A day later, on March 17, I will have the opportunity to attend the <a href="http://swisstestingday.ch/">Swiss Testing Day</a> conference, where I came as a guest at the request of James Whittaker, who is known to the specialist in the testing environment, who now works at Seattle's Google Test Director.

      On the evening of the same day, which is also St. Patrick's Day, this photo will be taken, which shows that testers are people too, also love beer and value pagan holidays too =) From left to right: BJ Rollison (Microsoft), I, Timur Khairullin (Yandex) and James Whittaker (Google) <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dd3/5a6/7bd/dd35a67bd735627aecb412b63744b24d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  I will write a report about the conference itself as soon as it ends, but now, while I am flying, I want to tell you how this all happened.  Such a simple, simple testirovchitskaya tale =) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all began in August 2009. When Thimson told me about the <a href="http://www.gtac.biz/">GTAC</a> conference and gave a link to the speech of James Whittaker on GTAC 09, then he also worked at Microsoft.  I have special relations with conferences: starting in 2008, I attended 9 conferences in the field of software testing and development, spoke at 7, was on the organizing committee twice, and now I‚Äôm a member of the program committee for the third time.  I really appreciate the fact that at conferences you can communicate with people who are doing something that interests me.  They do it well, and they are ready to tell how they do it.  And here - Google, Whittaker, Zurich, AAAAAAAAAA ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ <br><br>  According to the rules of GTAC 09, registration took place in August, applications were accepted until August 28, then the organizing committee considered them for several days and, starting from September 3, approved invitations and refusals were sent. <br>  I was just sure that I would receive confirmation, because when I submitted the application I wrote out my activity in the Russian-speaking community of testers in the column ‚ÄúWhy do you think?‚Äù. <br>  And here, on September 4, I receive a letter with the text " <i>Thank you for applying for attendance GTAC 2009. Unfortunately</i> , I‚Äôm not <i>happy</i> .  This, however, was very unexpected.  It‚Äôs good that I have a big monitor that hid my emotions from my colleagues. <br><br>  Rest assured, I began to think, why did the refusal come to me?  Ali, I'm not good =) Maybe the organizers did not read my comments?  Or I wrote little in them.  And I started writing an appeal. <br><br>  The letter turned out, in my opinion, quite emotional and at the same time contained enough facts. <br>  I will quote some points from it: <br><br>  <i>Let me explain why I'm striving to get GTAC ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>It is a fact that the main purpose of the GTAC is</i>  <i>You really do a great job.</i>  <i>Thanks for this.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I do the same for Russian-speaking testers.</i>  <i>I often speak at conferences and seminars.</i>  <i>Common solutions ............................................</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>My contribution to Russian-speaking testers.</i>  <i>I‚Äôm a member of the QA and QC engineers all over the ex-USSR area ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We‚Äôll give you a chance to learn their knowledge .................................................</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>So we are working in the same field with you.</i>  <i>I do believe that there are a lot of things I can learn from you.</i>  <i>Also you are happy.</i>  <i>We work hard to let people work easier ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I would like to review your request for getting GTAC one more time.</i>  <i>I get that you will be planted into fertile ground.</i>  <i>I promise. ‚Äù</i> <br>  However, after 2 days I get a negative, but, it should be noted, quite humane response from the organizers: <br><br>  <i>"Julia - thank you for your re-consideration - have declined the invites. "</i> <br><br>  Nenene, guys from Google.  You probably do not understand how I want to get to this conference =) <br><br>  But I know who can understand. <br>  James Whitaker.  Well, of course!  Such a cool and awesome uncle can't not respond to my desire.  Especially since by that time he had already become Test Director at Google.  Especially since he will surely perform there.  I get his contact, and my next letter flies to him.  Whittaker answered the next day.  In a rather friendly tone, he wrote that <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, you‚Äôve gotten the number of applicants this year was exceptionally high.</i>  <i>It turns out that it‚Äôs not.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Thanks for the note.</i>  <i>I am pleased with the discipline.</i>  <i>I hope we meet in person some day. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  I reply thank you, congratulate him on the Day of the tester (something happens on September 9) and already lay down my arms when I receive a letter from James, in which he writes 2 things: <br><br>  1 - " <i>I will be speaking in February</i>  <i>I‚Äôll be sure you‚Äôre up for the conference. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  2 - <i>"This is the book of Exploratory Software Testing. This is about his book.)</i>  <i>I'll get them.</i>  <i>I‚Äôll be visiting as well. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Here the monitor did not save me =) Yes, and why was it necessary to hide my emotions =) <br><br>  Looking ahead, I‚Äôll say that the book‚Äôs translation didn‚Äôt work, because the copyright holder James brought me in a rather dry form informed me that they don‚Äôt work with translators, but only transfer the rights to publish a book to a local publisher, and those themselves decide the issue of translation.  At my request to recommend me as a translator to a publishing house, with which they will cooperate on the subject of publishing a book in Russia, the manager of the publishing house-copyright holder advised me to look for suggestions on how to work an interpreter on the websites of Russian publishing houses =) <br><br>  Here Whittaker was powerless.  But on the other hand, our communication resulted in the translation of the cycle of his articles ‚Äú7 test evils‚Äù, which are published in my blog and on software-testing.ru.  By the way, I posted the translation of the first article on the very first day of GTAC 09, as if in revenge =) <br><br>  Slowly exchanging letters in mode 1 letter in the week with the subject ‚Äú <i>another article translated and posted‚Äù - ‚ÄúOh, great, thank you</i> ‚Äù, I completely calmed down, and I was warmed by the final phrase in the last letter from the organizers of GTAC ‚Äú <i>we're looking forward GTACs in the next years!</i>  " <br><br>  And so, on November 23, I receive a letter from James: <br>  <i>‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking at the Zurich on March 17. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve been able to get involved in the Zurich event.</i>  " <br><br>  I will not talk about how I had to transfer the plane, because I did not have time to deliver my passport with a visa from Kiev to Moscow.  I will not say here thanks to the people who helped me a lot, I said and I will tell them personally. <br>  I will not talk about the difficulties of obtaining a visa to Switzerland at the Ukrainian embassy, ‚Äã‚ÄãI can only say that it is quite possible for myself. <br><br>  And it is quite possible to get where you really want, if you go in this direction.  You should always shout about what you want, because the probability that a person who can help is in the audibility zone is very high. <br><br>  And still - listen, please, suddenly you can help the one who shouts nearby =) <br><br>  Thank, <br>  And I will continue to admire the clouds =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87990/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87990/</a></p>
