And sometimes experienced freelancers make mistakes when setting bids. <br><br>  <strong>So what could be the mistakes and how to avoid them?</strong> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's first digress from the rates a bit and speculate a little.  Imagine yourself in the role of a client who has an interesting project, say $ 1,000.  You published the project by selecting one of the freelance exchanges.  As a rule, if the exchange is large and well-known and you have a project from popular areas of web development, then from 10 to 30, and sometimes more people will respond to your project (for example, to understand who you should choose in <a href="http://www.free-lance.ru/blogs/view.php%3Ftr%3D143584">this project</a> it is necessary to revise the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe portfolio for meaningful rates in this project in general, no).  And at this very moment the most important question arises before the customer: how to choose from such a number of offers - one and not miscalculate? 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The answer is very simple, the majority of customers in such situations simply do not react to the rates of newbies with comments in the style ‚ÄúI am the most super-duper developer, I will do it for N dollars‚Äù.  Such comments do not make the eyes ‚Äúcatch on‚Äù for something interesting. <br><br>  In order to draw the customer‚Äôs attention and ‚Äúforce‚Äù him to choose you, he must be interested, for example, by showing that you understand this area. <br><br>  In order not to argue unfoundedly, let's take <a href="http://weblancer.net/projects/21759.html" title="webcasting project">this project</a> , which was won by a freelancer (and in combination with a habraiser) <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/tvv/" class="user_link">tvv</a> Vadim Timofeev.  Rate can be found <a href="http://weblancer.net/projects/21759.html%3Fsection%3Dbids">here</a> . <br><br>  The project, judging by the task, is quite simple.  What did you need to do to win a project?  It was necessary to make the <b>customer's eye</b> when reading bets <b>caught on</b> the bet. <br><br>  How to achieve this? <br><ol><li>  Firstly, the customer will certainly be interested in the rating in the system (such a conclusion can be made based on the fact that the customer himself has a rating in the system, hence he trusts the rating) </li><li>  Secondly, to look more profitable in the eyes of the customer, you need to describe the process itself, how you will implement the project </li></ol><br>  The second item was made only by two (!) Of 9 people (in fact, at the time of publication of the note on Habr√©, there are already 7 out of 9, which undoubtedly indicates that freelancers also pay attention to their rating), the remaining 7 people are customer probably did not even look, and if he did, it did not take long.  But on the first point I won from 2 people, which fulfilled the second point - only one of them had a rating - the winner of the project. <br><br>  Of course, situations are different and customers with rating do not always come across who pay attention to bets with meaning, however, by making a bet with meaning, and not just ‚ÄúI will.‚Äù  Write in icq ‚Äù- significantly increases your chances of winning the project.  Attach to the description, show what you are capable of, sort through the task.  This will be the first step to the project, if you choose. <br><br>  <b>So, what mistakes do when betting:</b> <br><ol><li>  The rate is uninformative, does not force itself to "catch" </li><li>  The comment to the rate is not literate, contains many errors, both grammatical and syntactic, spelling </li><li>  According to the comment to the rate it is clear that the performer did not even read the description of the project.  For example, the draft says that PHP development is not to be offered, but the contractor writes ‚ÄúI will do it in PHP‚Äù.  These bets immediately go to the "trash" </li><li>  Comment to the rate - template - that is, in the style of "write in icq" </li><li>  Do not write too little price for the project.  Do not write and too big </li></ol><br>  <b>How to increase your chances of winning a project with your bid?</b> <br><br>  To do this, try to do this: <br><ol><li>  Make meaningful bets on projects.  Show the customer that you are ‚Äúchopping the chip,‚Äù and not just ‚Äúone of the 30 who wrote‚Äù </li><li>  Write correctly, try to avoid mistakes, for example, ‚ÄúI will do it kohichestvenno‚Äù </li><li>  Read the project description.  Very often it is written in them that the client wants to see from you or that does not want </li><li>  Do not make template bets.  Or if you use them, think about 3-4 templates in advance for different cases, so that it doesn‚Äôt happen that the client asks to write, how you see the work on the project, and in return receives a ‚Äúteam of 40 professionals who will do your work for ...‚Äù and further everything like that and not a word about what the client asked </li><li>  Do not look at the customer rating and image.  The price you set for the project should not be guided by who the client is.  Do not specify too low a price - this is a reason to think that you underestimate yourself or simply do not understand what you have to do if the client chooses you </li><li>  Bet among the first - ideally first, but with the points described above. </li><li>  Format the text of the sentence.  Large monolithic pieces of text do not allow the eye to cling to the information that you would like to convey to the customer </li></ol><br>  For item 7, a special thank you to the vovixldr <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/vovixldr/" class="user_link">user</a> <br><br>  I hope that after reading this note, you will correct your mistakes (if any) and your bids will become more meaningful and understandable to customers, and the bet / won ratio of the project will tend to unity. <br><br>  <b>Successes.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27804/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27804/</a></p>
