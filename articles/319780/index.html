  <section class="page js-page"><h1>JetBrains master class on C ++ Russia 2017</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  On February 24-25, 2017, Moscow will host the next annual <a href="http://2017.cppconf.ru/">C ++ Russia conference</a> organized by the C ++ User Group Russia community.  JetBrains has been developing C ++ products for several years and traditionally participates in this event.  You can find our employees at the exhibition booth during both days - ask a question, ask for help with a problem with any of our products, ask about the capabilities of our tools, our plans for the future, or just talk about the C ++ language and not only. <br><br>  If you want to become a real development guru in C ++, then note that on the eve of the conference, February 23, a whole series of master classes from experienced developers is planned. <br><br>  The <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/cpp_russia/blog/319116/">C ++ User Group Russia blog</a> has already written about some of them.  We want to talk about the master classes (and there are as many as three planned!) That JetBrains employees will conduct.

      By the way, a master class ticket is separate from the conference ticket, it includes participation and meals and allows you to attend any master classes from the <a href="http://2017.cppconf.ru/">program</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Tools for Effective C ++ Development </h2><br>  The C ++ language is not easy to learn and use, and the breakthrough evolution of recent standards (the so-called <i>modern</i> C ++) has solved many problems, but it has significantly increased the level of complexity of the language.  Creating quality C ++ code quickly and efficiently is a particular art.  Fortunately, there are tools that help us in this.  The development of such tools is the company JetBrains. <br><br>  This series of workshops is designed to teach you how to improve the efficiency and quality of C ++ development using CLion and ReSharper C ++.  We also want to give you the opportunity to get acquainted with one of today's most popular project building systems - CMake. <br><br>  Among other things, you will have the time and opportunity to ask any questions about our products to members of the CLion and ReSharper C ++ teams, even if they are not directly related to the materials of the master class. <br><br><h3>  Part 1: Productive Cross-Platform C ++ Development Using CLion </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75e/0e2/197/75e0e2197f2c451fb5c859a783b0848b.png" width="200" height="200"><br>  Cross-platform development in C and C ++ is distinguished by the variety of tools and libraries involved, the wide range of language standards used, and the abundance of legacy code. <br><br>  CLion is a cross-platform integrated development environment for C and C ++.  As part of this master class, we will analyze the basic scenarios of working with C ++ code and see how CLion helps us navigate through them faster and more efficiently, analyze a lot of typical C ++ problems and how to solve them with the help of CLion. <br><br>  As a result, you will learn: <br><br><ul><li>  quickly understand the new code based on additional information provided by CLion and derived from code analysis - a resource-intensive and difficult task if solved manually (a typical example could be type inference or understanding of code that uses overload resolution widely) </li><li>  use the powerful features of the IntelliJ platform for working with code, including integration with VCS, the built-in terminal and plug-ins for many other languages ‚Äã‚Äãbesides C ++ </li><li>  find errors and correct them on the fly (without compiling the project), including complex scripts related to the data flow in your program </li><li>  refactor C ++ code without ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù it </li><li>  debug code efficiently </li><li>  and even generate a lot of standard code in one keystroke on the keyboard (thereby saving yourself from copying errors and different coding styles) </li></ul><br><h3>  Part 2: CMake is a build system that every C ++ developer should know about. </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/028/862/345/028862345cd9459495cf6693f3ce9491.png" width="274" height="254"></div><br>  You have probably heard that CMake is gradually becoming the de facto standard in the C ++ world, many projects (for example, LLVM) are migrating to it.  Or maybe they even tried to transfer your project to CMake or, at least, thought about this possibility?  Then this is the part for you! <br><br>  As part of this master class, we will try to explain why CMake is not really an assembly system in the usual sense, to outline the main scenarios for using CMake and to talk in detail about key concepts, commands and approaches.  In addition, we will pay attention to how CLion uses information from CMake files and how it can facilitate their writing. <br><br>  As a result, you will learn: <br><br><ul><li>  understand what opportunities CMake provides you </li><li>  create basic CMake projects </li><li>  use third-party libraries in your CMake projects </li><li>  understand and work with the basic commands and constructs of the CMake language </li><li>  use ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù and avoid CMake anti-patterns </li><li>  use CLion features to make CMake writing easier </li></ul><br><h3>  Part 3: Productive Development in C ++ using ReSharper C ++ </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/523/017/1ad/5230171ad83b436bb79dcb65c1b6cadf.png" width="200" height="200"></div><br>  ReSharper C ++ - Visual Studio extension for C and C ++ development.  As part of this workshop, we will examine common scripts for working with C ++ code and see how ReSharper C ++ can be useful in them.  Let's see how ReSharper C ++ finds and helps to fix some problems typical for C ++. <br><br>  As a result, you will learn: <br><br><ul><li>  quickly understand the new code.  Here are some features of ReSharper C ++ that help in this task: <br><br><ul><li>  navigation, including non-trivial cases of overloaded functions and specialized patterns </li><li>  various searches (by symbol name, by redefined methods, search by base classes, ...) </li><li>  symbol documentation tooltips </li><li>  Type Hierarchy, Include Hierarchy, File Structure </li></ul><br></li><li>  find errors and suspicious places in the code and correct them on the fly </li><li>  debug complex compile-time errors when expanding macros and template metaprogramming </li><li>  create and run unit tests </li><li>  refactor C ++ code without ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù it </li><li>  and even generate lots of standard code with one keystroke on the keyboard </li></ul><br>  In addition, the master class will provide recommendations on how to optimize the performance of ReSharper. <br><br>  Much of the functionality that will be discussed is not C ++ specific, so it is also available for other languages ‚Äã‚Äãsupported by ReSharper. <br><br>  All details are available <a href="http://2017.cppconf.ru/workshops/jetbrains">here</a> . <br><br>  <i>We will be glad to see you at our workshops and at the conference itself!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>C ++ JetBrains team</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319780/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319780/</a></p>
