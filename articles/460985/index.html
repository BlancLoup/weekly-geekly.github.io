      If you are just about to <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/hygger/blog/351576/">switch to Kanban</a> and take a closer look at the popular methodology, be sure to immerse yourself in the affordable <a href="https://hygger.io/blog/quick-kanban-tutorial-insight-concept/">Kanban guides</a> and <a href="https://hygger.io/blog/quick-kanban-tutorial-insight-concept/">guides</a> for beginners. <br><br>  In short, Kanban is a project management method aimed at minimizing multitasking, increasing production efficiency and optimizing the speed and quality of work.  The method is widely used in large teams, startups and for individual purposes. <br><br>  Correctly selected software with the Kanban function will allow you to focus on priorities, keep your team informed of what is relevant and what will happen in the near future, as well as control all work processes. <br><br>  An effective Kanban tool will help you manage your Agile development with convenient boards and cards, workflow, Swimlanes and WIP limits, charts and timelines - all that help you visualize workflow management. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/00b/743/cbd/00b743cbd3b39449aded80402f81416f.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  What Includes Powerful Kanban Software </h3><br>  At first glance, the Kanban system may seem complicated and not always applicable.  But the real strength of Kanban is that as soon as the team begins to apply its principles, it can immediately optimize and standardize work processes. <br><br>  However, there are solutions that do the job better and more efficiently than others.  Consider the main criteria for finding the best Kanban tool: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Kanban board</b> - a system that is designed to organize cards with tasks using horizontal columns (Swimlanes), restrictions (WIP limits), subcolumns, as well as a standard set of columns ("To-do", "In Progress" and "Done"). </li><li>  <b>Kanban card</b> is an element of the Kanban system that assigns tasks using checklists and attachments.  Cards allow you to link tasks, add a hierarchy, and assign the necessary resources. </li><li>  <b>Analytics</b> - a system that allows you to create reports. </li><li>  <b>Integration</b> - the ability of the tool to easily integrate with other project management systems. </li><li>  <b>Automation</b> - the ability to customize the workflow in accordance with the conditions of your project. </li></ul><br><h2>  Best Kanban Project Management Tools </h2><br>  You basically have two ways: <br><br><ul><li>  Do not bother and thoughtlessly register with the proven and notorious JIRA or Trello. </li><li>  Spend some time exploring a new wave of cool Kanban-oriented project management software to select the most suitable software for your needs. </li></ul><br>  In any case, the choice is yours.  Here is a brief description of some of them: <br><br><div class="scrollable-table"><table><tbody><tr><th>  BY </th><th>  Best for </th></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a> </td><td>  For software development by Agile teams.

This is a really popular universal RM software, which allows development teams to plan tasks, assign performers, work with sprints, set priorities and deadlines, and much more. <br><br>  JIRA provides a large number of filtering settings, convenient visualization, detailed reports and a convenient time tracker. <br><br>  <b>Doubts:</b> JIRA is well suited for technical teams, but small companies and startups simply will not be able to use all the features of the service.  There is no way to assign multiple performers for one task. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bad/e82/778/bade82778adc9224dfef1fc4bcf5e447.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Trello </h3><br>  Trello is a popular management tool that lets you organize tasks, to-do lists, initiatives, discussions, and ideas on one board.  The service is quite simple and intuitive, and many companies just need its basic free version for work.  The Trello system is suitable for anyone who needs the basic functionality of Kanban boards. <br><br>  <b>Doubts:</b> Trello does not have its own time tracking, so you will have to pay for other software (such as Everhour or Toggle).  In addition, Trello has no WIP limits, Swimlanes, or Burndown charts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ed/51f/692/6ed51f692856f12b20e3068d6c8ffb00.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Hygger </h3><br>  Hygger is a vibrant representative of the new generation of PM tools, which is great for grocery companies, startups and mid-sized organizations.  The service provides convenient to-do lists with custom fields, Kanban boards, Swimlanes functions, WIP limits and Timelines. <br><br>  The advantage of the service is the ability to prioritize functions, ideas or tasks using various prioritization methods.  This factor is often crucial when choosing Hygger vs Trello.  By the way, if you are familiar with the functionality of Trello, then quickly getting used to Hygger is not difficult, because the platform has a similar interface. <br><br>  Hygger offers to prioritize using simple methods (Eisenhower matrix, Value vs Effort, Value vs Risk), as well as advanced techniques (ICE and RICE, Weighted Scoring). <br><br>  <b>Doubts:</b> There is not enough ability to switch from Kanban to timeline automatically, there is no multilanguage support. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13c/712/fdf/13c712fdf1f67f422026930932f294a1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Asana </h3><br>  Asana is no less popular service with affordable iOS and Android applications, which is good at managing tasks, tracking deadlines and setting priorities.  Asana allows you to qualitatively monitor the status of the implementation of tasks and the status of the project as a whole. <br><br>  Service is most often chosen for personal use and the work of small teams, which primarily need to-do lists and a basic Kanban board. <br><br>  <b>Doubts: The</b> form is unlikely to be useful to marketing and creative agencies or service companies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98d/b68/716/98db68716102b0743ffca92e91ff6e97.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Favro </h3><br>  Favro provides an innovative project management solution that is best suited for developers, marketers and executives who plan, track and develop their ideas.  Favro offers built-in support for Kanban and Scrum boards with dashboards, scalable backlags and reports. <br><br>  The Breakdown function in Favro helps break down your projects into different tasks.  The tool is integrated with Google Drive and Dropbox, which allows you to attach files to the planning board. <br><br>  <b>Doubts:</b> Managing boards is not as easy as it might seem.  Not all software functions can be fully used: better fewer features, but better service work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d9/2a2/94a/9d92a294a6bcae94c783ef6fa7e403c6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  MeisterTask </h3><br>  MeisterTask is suitable for teams of any size and composition.  Key areas the tool can help are file management, time tracking, and reporting. <br><br>  MeisterTask Kanban boards help users view and manage ongoing activities and active projects, create project plans, and collaborate with team members.  The platform offers integration with GitHub, DropBox, Zendesk and Bitbucket. <br><br>  <b>Doubts:</b> Lack of a calendar that could show when you planned your tasks.  There are no Gantt charts to set the duration for tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c6/380/6d2/3c63806d20c951662e57c5936ef61c85.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Kanbanchi </h3><br>  Kanbanchi is another suitable solution if you need task management and collaboration software with Kanban boards, Gantt charts and time tracking. <br><br>  You easily visualize the work processes of all tasks and actions with the help of convenient project boards with lists and cards.  The tool is designed for G Suite.  You need to register with a Google account, manage boards in the form of files on a Google drive, put dates on a Google calendar, etc. The application is great for the departments of the company, because each member of the team knows what he is working on. <br><br>  <b>Doubts:</b> There is no mobile version and some important integrations; there is no way to group cards together. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c20/110/be2/c20110be2ea363444be13bce57db2121.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Paymo </h3><br>  Choosing Paymo, you get a fully functional management tool with a system of planning, task management, billing and time tracking.  The service is also great for teams who want to competently prioritize tasks.  Paymo allows you to work from one application without switching from one platform to another. <br><br>  <b>Doubts:</b> It will take some time to get used to Paymo, because there are many options on the desktop.  When working with dozens of small projects, the user interface becomes quite busy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cdd/9ff/8b0/cdd9ff8b04545c07ef90698f9db2096e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Breeze </h3><br>  Another great solution for managing client projects with Kanban boards.  Breeze is suitable for small businesses and freelancers who need to organize and monitor everything clearly and quickly. <br><br>  The tool is based on the principles of Agile and Lean and includes the following main functions: task lists, time tracking, project budgeting, reporting, calendar, data export, unlimited number of users, Android and iOS support, integration with Google Drive and Dropbox, etc. P. <br><br>  <b>Doubts: A</b> small number of tools with which Breeze can be integrated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/522/d43/bcb/522d43bcb8df7a6ffbd4b7c731c112de.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Blossom </h3><br>  Blossom has been developed for targeted use in projects managed by the Kanban methodology.  As with other Kanban-oriented tools, you should display project steps in lists.  The main difference between Blossom is that each list should be the next step in the process.  You must add new cards in the 1st column on the left, and the archive button is displayed in the last column on the right. <br><br>  Blossom allows you to use analytics with a count of the number of cards sent and a chart showing how much time it took to produce each card. <br><br>  <b>Doubts:</b> There is no free plan for personal use.  Integration capabilities - only sending updates to the Slack channel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/30c/62f/0c8/30c62f0c8be410db882176d473cfcb08.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Proofub </h3><br>  Well-known brands that have chosen ProofHub have appreciated this cloud-based project management software, which helps them easily manage deadlines and results. <br><br>  ProofHub offers advanced features and price packages in accordance with the requirements of various companies, as well as applications for iOS and Android, which allows users to work more productively.  Among the key functions, we highlight task lists, calendars, discussions, Gantt charts, convenient schedules, etc. <br><br>  <b>Doubts:</b> ProofHub may seem too simple at first glance, but may not be suitable for complex projects and large organizations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd5/72b/8de/cd572b8debbd20bca7d99589c1d41935.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Zenhub </h3><br>  The main advantage of ZenHub is that it integrates initially with the GitHub user interface, so developers remain in the familiar environment, and project managers can get a complete picture of the development process. <br><br>  The tool can be used to organize, plan and run sprints.  No special training is needed - ZenHub is widely used by both the development team and the products.  The main functions are Kanban boards, to-do lists, Burndown charts, time evaluations, integration with Slack, etc. <br><br>  <b>Doubts:</b> Zenhub does not provide enough analytical and reporting functions.  There are some ‚Äúquirks‚Äù in UX that can periodically distract and disturb. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e4/ac1/05a/2e4ac105aa4be4421e19fdc07799be49.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Taiga </h3><br>  Taiga - the choice of developers, project managers, designers and other practitioners of the Agile methodology.  The cloud platform includes project collaboration, task management, bug tracking, reporting, and a time tracking system.  When choosing a tool, you also get custom Kanban boards and backlogs. <br><br>  The service can be easily integrated with GitHub, GitLab, Webhooks, Bitbucket and Gogs.  Available mobile applications for Android, iOS and Windows. <br><br>  <b>Doubts:</b> The interface looks a bit old-fashioned.  The screens are quite complex - this is a bit confusing to work with their different types. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/519/899/655/51989965582374ffc31ec30e81ea9568.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Leankit </h3><br>  LeanKit is also an affordable Kanban service designed for companies of any size in various industries.  It helps project teams seamlessly implement Lean principles and practices. <br><br>  LeanKit offers a convenient way to connect project boards at the team and project level and provides users with complete visibility.  You will also receive a reporting and analytics module with useful metrics and metrics.  The platform supports integration with JIRA, Zendesk, Pivotal Tracker and other tools. <br><br>  <b>Doubts:</b> A lot of spam e-mail - even a small change to the task will be sent to you by email.  Lack of basic integration options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c5/eb8/980/0c5eb89801ca18137a9b6d8d6b6b2666.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Regardless of whether you choose a stand-alone Kanban tool or a wider project management package, you can be sure that using the Kanban system in a project management strategy will expand the capabilities of your team and make its life easier.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/460985/">https://habr.com/ru/post/460985/</a></p>
