    <h3>  ACP exams: what options does Atlassian offer </h3><br>  About 70,000 companies use Atlassian products.  Each of them requires a qualified administrator.  The management of these companies will prefer to work with a professional whose skills are officially confirmed by Atlassian. <br><br>  For this reason, in 2017, Atlassian launched a new certification system that is available not only to Atlassian Solution Partners, but also to Atlassian administrators, freelancers and companies who want to improve their employees' skills. <br><br>  Certification is not for beginners.  Administrators with 2 years of experience can confirm their status with the exam and discover new career prospects. <br><br>  Atlassian offers 5 exams for Atlassian Certified Professional (ACP) status and topics to prepare for. <br><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/university/certification/certifications/exam-acp-100">ACP-100 JIRA Administrator</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/university/certification/certifications/exam-acp-200">ACP-200 Confluence Administrator</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/university/certification/certifications/exam-acp-300">ACP-300 Agile Development with JIRA Software</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/university/certification/certifications/exam-acp-400">ACP-400 JIRA Service Desk Administration</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/university/certification/certifications/exam-acp-500">ACP-500 Atlassian System Administrator</a> </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9a4/277/495/9a42774957f74b60b98a894325c8148e.png"><br><br><h3>  Algorithm for obtaining the status of Atlassian Certified Professional </h3><br><ol><li>  Choose an exam. </li><li>  Examine the exam information on the links above.  Pay attention to the description of the exam. </li><li>  Download exam topics and evaluate the level of training. </li><li>  Repeat <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/alldoc/atlassian-documentation-32243719.html">Atlassian documentation</a> exam topics. </li><li>  Look for answers to incomprehensible questions in the <a href="https://community.atlassian.com/">Atlassian Community</a> . </li><li>  Complete <a href="https://training.atlassian.com/cert">preparatory courses</a> on the exam. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.certmetrics.com/atlassian/public/candidate_registration.aspx">Register</a> on the Atlassian certification portal. </li><li>  Find a nearby <a href="https://www.kryteriononline.com/Locate-Test-Center">Kryterion training center</a> . </li><li>  Select exam date. </li><li>  Pay exam card. </li><li>  Pass the exam. </li></ol><br><h3>  Certification Certification </h3><br>  At the preparation stage, you improve your knowledge: you repeat the material using the example of real business cases and learn new aspects of working with Atlassian products that you have not encountered before.  After passing the exam, you get access to Atlassian Badges - additional tests that confirm the in-depth knowledge of Atlassian features and extend the validity period of the ACP status received. <br><br>  Currently only the JIRA badge is available - <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/university/certification/badges/exam-acb-110">ACB-110 Advanced JIRA Workflows</a> .  It is in beta and costs $ 75.  The rest of the badges are at the development stage.  Examinations for the ACP are held at the Kryterion test centers.  The test for a badge you pass online from your home or office. <br><br><h3>  Timing </h3><br>  The validity period of ACP certification is 1.5 years.  Atlassian offers to extend the certification in two ways: pass the ACP exam again after 1.5 years or pass a badge test right after the ACP exam or while the ACP certification is valid. <br><br>  While your Atlassian Certified Professional status is active, we recommend earning appropriate badges to improve your skills. <br><br>  Each badge extends certification for another 18 months.  If you forgot to extend the certification, you will have to pass the ACP exam again. <br><br><h2>  Atlassian Certified Professionals recommend </h2><br><h3>  Training </h3><br>  Take one exam.  Because it is difficult to pass several exams at once due to the large amount of information. <br><br>  To prepare should be thoroughly.  Many have read the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-study-jira-administrator-certification-rachel-wright">blog of Rachel Wright</a> , who passed the JIRA administration exam, one of the first at the beta testing stage.  According to her, she spent about 10 hours preparing for the exam.  Don't forget that Rachel has been working with Atlassian products for a long time and wrote the book " <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-study-jira-administrator-certification-rachel-wright">JIRA Strategy Admin Workbook</a> ".  Therefore, we advise you not to overestimate your capabilities, even if you have many years of experience.  The ACP exam covers a much wider range of problems than an administrator encounters in real life.  You should be equally good at Server and Cloud versions.  If you are not an expert with the highest level of training with experience in curriculum development, we recommend that you allocate enough time for preparation: at least a week. <br><br>  Certified administrators point out the benefits of <a href="https://training.atlassian.com/cert">Atlassian training courses</a> : <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://training.atlassian.com/elearning/jira-administrator-certification-prep-ondemand">JIRA Administrator Certification Prep</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://training.atlassian.com/elearning/confluence-administrator-certification-prep-ondemand">Confluence Administrator Certification Prep</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://training.atlassian.com/elearning/agile-development-with-jira-sw-certification-prep-ondemand">Agile Development using JIRA Software Certification Prep</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://training.atlassian.com/elearning/jira-servicedesk-administrator-certification-prep-on-demand">JIRA Service Desk Administrator Certification Prep</a> </li></ul><br>  Courses increase your chances of passing the exam the first time and contain conditional examples of exam questions.  When you pass the preparatory course tests, you see your mistakes with explanations.  ACP preparatory courses are free for Atlassian partner companies.  Otherwise, the cost of 1 preparatory course is $ 150. <br><br>  Remember that you access the course for 120 days, i.e.  If you have not had time to go through all the topics in 4 months, you will have to pay $ 150 again. <br><br>  In the preparatory courses you will learn that you need to answer questions not from the point of view of your work experience, but from the point of view of best practices.  In the test, you may encounter a question to which all the answers may be correct in essence, but only one is correct in terms of best practices. <br><br>  Atlassian offer <a href="https://training.atlassian.com/%3Ftab%3Dcertification-prep">other</a> exam <a href="https://training.atlassian.com/%3Ftab%3Dcertification-prep">training courses</a> .  You can choose courses that match your level of knowledge. <br><br><h3>  check in </h3><br>  During registration specify the full name as written in the ID.  This is relevant for countries in which documents are not in English.  Due to the difference in the spelling of the name, there may be problems when you come to the Kryterion test center exam and at the time of receiving the certificate. <br><br>  On <a href="https://www.certmetrics.com/atlassian/login.aspx%3FReturnUrl%3D%25252fatlassian%25252f">the Atlassian certification portal</a> and in <a href="https://www.onlineproctoring.com/">the Kryterion test system,</a> first enter your personal email, and then add a worker.  Because the skill is attached to you as a specialist.  For example, if you leave the company, it loses its status as an Atlassian Solution Partner.  Accordingly, the company in which you settle, this skill can acquire. <br><br>  After registering on the Atlassian certification portal, click on the link to Kryterion to pay only with a card and select an exam date. <br><br>  After payment, you will receive a Test Taker Authorization Code (for example, eg AT0000123).  Be sure to take it with you for the exam.  It gives access to the examination tasks. <br><br>  Book an exam in advance, not less than 5 days before the desired date.  <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/university/certification/policies">You can transfer the</a> ACP <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/university/certification/policies">exam date for</a> free, the latest term is 72 hours before the exam.  If you decide to move the date in less than 72 hours, you will have to pay $ 150. <br><br>  Transfer of the online badge exam is possible in 24 hours, otherwise you will have to pay $ 75. <br><br>  To transfer the date, log in to your account from the computer.  The important point is that at the moment you cannot transfer the date from any mobile device. <br><br>  If you decide to cancel the exam, do it at least 72 hours before the start of the exam.  Otherwise, $ 150.50 will be deducted from the amount of your refand. <br><br><h4>  Exam </h4><br>  Take with you to the exam 2 ID document with your photo and signature, it is very important.  For example, a passport and driver's license. <br><br>  We recommend to come early to have time to go through registration and take your place in the audience. <br><br>  Do not forget the Test Taker Authorization Code, it provides access to the exam tasks. <br><br>  You cannot take personal belongings with you to the exam, including your wallet, cell phone, bag, outerwear.  You will be asked to leave all the excess in another room.  Non-speaker speakers are allowed to take an English dictionary for the exam. <br><br>  If you are distracted by extraneous sounds (typing on the keyboard, clicking the mouse or sounds in a nearby audience), bring earplugs with you. <br><br>  The exam lasts 3 hours, so we do not recommend to come hungry.  Be sure to eat so as not to be distracted during the exam. <br><br><h4>  Questions </h4><br>  It is allowed to review already answered questions and change the answer option.  You mark the questions you want to review.  They then stand out in the list. <br><br>  We analyzed the experience of our employees and tips on forums from those who have already passed certification.  Opinions on how to answer the exam questions were divided. <br><br>  In the comments to the post of Rachel, we found advice to first answer short questions.  Because long questions can be simple, but they take a lot of time to read, study the diagrams, understand the question and choose the right answer.  You are immersed in the topic and can lose time.  Remember that for every correct answer to any of the exam questions you get the same number of points.  Therefore, it makes sense to answer long questions after you have answered all short ones. <br><br>  There is also an opposite opinion: after all, look at the questions and answer in turn, and those in doubt have to postpone and reconsider at the end.  Because somewhere in an hour there are already problems with concentration, which can prevent you from going into long questions. <br><br>  During the exam, we suggest assessing the pace and, depending on your level of training and concentration, choose the option that suits you. <br><br>  The exam result is known immediately after you click Submit.  All you see is the percentage of correct answers on the topics presented (Topic Level Scoring).  This is all available information that was correct or not.  There is no way to view the correct and incorrect answers. <br><br><h3>  What if you surrendered </h3><br>  Congratulations! <br><br>  First, the status is displayed in the Kryterion system, after which it is synchronized with the Atlassian certification portal during the day. <br><br>  24 hours after the exam, log in to your account on the Atlassian portal and confirm your status.  In response, you will receive an email with instructions for downloading the electronic certificate.  You will also receive a letter of congratulations on behalf of CEO Atlasian Mike and Scott. <br><br><h3>  How to share your achievement with others? </h3><br>  Atlassian offers several options: <br><br><ul><li>  Upload your electronic certificate on the Atlassian portal in the Certifications section.  Download the certificate in pdf. </li><li>  Add your skill in LinkedIn.  Log in to your LinkedIn account and follow the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/44644%3Fquery%3Dcertifications">instructions</a> . </li></ul><br>  You can add the signature on your Atlassian badge to your email, get a link to add to the corporate website, electronic resume.  This information is presented in more detail on <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/university/faq/certification">the Atlassian website</a> in the ‚ÄúHow can I showcase my new Atlassian Certifications‚Äù section. <br><br>  Your ACP certificate is valid for 18 months. <br><br><h3>  What to do if you do not pass </h3><br>  The main thing - do not despair. <br><br>  After the exam, you will receive an email with a discount code when you retake.  Retake will cost $ 150.50 with discount.  You can re-register for the exam after 7 days, but we recommend taking a break and reviewing the exam topics. <br><br>  Allowed 5 attempts to pass one exam.  If you used 5 attempts and did not fail, contact Atlassian support and they will tell you what further actions will be taken. <br><br><h3>  Remember </h3><br><ol><li>  Allow enough time for preparation. </li><li>  Learn about exam topics in Atlassian sources: <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/alldoc/atlassian-documentation-32243719.html">documentation</a> and the <a href="https://community.atlassian.com/">Atlassian Community</a> . </li><li>  Complete all the <a href="https://training.atlassian.com/">preparatory course</a> topics. </li><li>  Carefully read all the information on the exam that you will take: from the product version to the retake information. </li><li>  Visit the site of the center where you will take the exam.  Read the information. </li><li>  Gather a study group.  If your company has employees who are also preparing for the exam, you can exchange information and get ready together. </li><li>  After passing the exam, do not forget to confirm your status: receive badges or retake the ACP. </li><li>  Enjoy new career opportunities that opens up the status of ACP. </li><li>  Do not forget that all information about exam questions is confidential.  No need to publish the number of correct answers in social networks and share details about exam questions.  Atlassian can punish you for it: cancel the results of your exam or bring to justice through the courts. </li></ol><br>  We hope that our article clarified the incomprehensible moments of certification.  If you have any questions, ask them in the comments to the article.  We will respond to them with pleasure. <br><br>  We wish you good luck on exams! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/333432/">https://habr.com/ru/post/333432/</a></p>
