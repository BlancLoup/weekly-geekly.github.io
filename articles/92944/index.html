For more than 2 years this service has been helping residents of Russia and the CIS easily make purchases not just anywhere, but in the United States of America itself. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d56/72d/e15/d5672de15913d59d79b7eef9db321155.gif" alt="image"></div>

      What exactly do we do: <br>  1) we assist in the acquisition of goods at eBay auction, <br>  2) we help to make purchases in any American online stores, <br>  3) provide mailforwarding services. <br><br>  At Habr√©, we are planning a cycle of posts in which we will tell in detail about all the intricacies of our service, share valuable experience, give useful tips and recommendations. <br><br>  Well?  Go? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h3>  Why do you need it at all? </h3><br><br>  Many habrayusers have long since discovered the secret that the majority of goods sold in the United States are much cheaper than similar ones in Russia or the CIS.  We will not go into the details of why this is happening now (we will deal with it better in one of the subsequent posts), but the fact is a fact. <br><br>  Due to this, today already thousands of Russians make their own purchases through the Internet in America, without asking anyone or asking for help from anyone.  Indeed, there is nothing fundamentally difficult in the very fact of acquiring anything from abroad.  However, a simple user, seduced by an interesting overseas purchase, will inevitably have to spend some amount of time, patience and money. <br><br>  First of all, you need to know English at least at the level of a ‚Äúgood student‚Äù.  You will have to spend a few hours in your arms with a dictionary (or with a translator, if you have one) - otherwise there is a chance to buy a player, washed together with jeans, instead of a new iPod. <br><br>  You will also need to create an account in the payment system PayPal.  And for this you need to have a credit card of international standard - not lower than Visa Classic.  Such a card is not so cheap. <br><br>  It will be necessary in the subtleties to understand the features of the work of each online store and auction - to know everything about the order process, ratings, methods of packaging and delivery. <br><br>  In addition, you will have to limit your choice only to those stores and sellers of the eBay auction, which provide international delivery, and often the most tasty products are not delivered outside the United States. <br><br>  In a word, in order to make purchases independently and safely, you will have to learn a bunch of new things. <br><br>  However, problems in this field may arise for anyone, even the most advanced and experienced buyer. <br><br><h3>  What we offer </h3><br><br>  We offer our services as an intermediary in the purchase of goods from abroad.  With our service, buying in the US is as easy as if you lived in America.  With us you will not have to make a PayPal wallet, register in a pile of American online stores, conduct correspondence in English with the seller, solve the problems of payment and delivery of goods - we will deal with all this. <br><br>  You will only need to find the product of interest on the website, add it to the order form, pay in any convenient way and observe how your purchase moves from the seller to our warehouse in the US, and from the warehouse to your home. <br><br>  The whole process of buying through EbayToday looks very simple: <br><br>  <b>1) choose the product you need,</b> <b><br></b>  <b>2) add it to ‚ÄúMy Shopping‚Äù on EbayToday,</b> <b><br></b>  <b>3) replenish your account on EbayToday and pay for the purchase,</b> <b><br></b>  <b>4) waiting for the courier or notification from the post office.</b> <br><br>  Of course, "inside" behind all this is the great daily work of our Russian and American offices. <br><br>  After receiving the application, first of all, our operators will arrange your purchase - check the correctness of filling in all the fields (although they are few, but suddenly), as well as the availability of goods from the seller and if everything is correct, they will buy the goods.  Then the purchase will arrive at our American warehouse in the town of Medfield, Massachusetts, it is not far from Boston.  The warehouse, by the way, looks like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c05/0a7/255/c050a72554aa2ddb63c3ac0235c5f7d7.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  In stock, our employees will repack the product and, if necessary, check it out.  If you made purchases in several stores and in order to save, you want to send all purchases in one package - they will form one large package from those products that you specify on the website.  From the American warehouse, your parcel will be sent to Russia or the CIS by one of the three available types of delivery - also your choice. <br><br>  As you can see, all these technical features do not concern the EbayToday client - it only needs to complete the purchase and track its execution through the website. <br><br><h3>  How are we different from others? </h3><br><br>  Now in Russia there are enough services that fill the niche of intermediaries when buying abroad.  Many of them act as "helpers", some take on part of the rough work of redemption and delivery, most are engaged in the resale of clothing and electronics purchased in the US - they buy cheaper, they sell more expensive.  In short, everything is like in the dashing nineties. <br><br>  We decided to create a real serious service that could provide quality services, without any tricks.  We do not sell Chinese sneakers and broken MacBooks, we help our users to purchase what they themselves want to buy. <br><br>  First of all, we are not limited to one eBay auction (which may seem from our name), but also offer to make purchases from any US online stores, from Amazon to Best Buy.  Strictly speaking, we generally do not limit the buyer to any particular list of stores, he can make purchases even in small, unknown shops - nothing will change for him. <br><br>  EbayToday eliminates many difficulties with the delivery of things - we send purchases, including via EMS, saving customers from the DHL nightmares.  We can deliver and various large-size purchases - skis, snowboards, auto parts, guitars in wardrobe trunks and any other rather big cargo. <br><br>  We have a variety of payment methods - from the usual WebMoney and Yandex.Money, to the most exotic.  <a href="http://ebaytoday.ru/payment">Here</a> you can see the entire list. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/915/724/277/915724277292183498201d375a97655c.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  We have long and seriously worked on the site interface (and, by the way, do not stop improving it for a minute).  Any purchase can be controlled at all stages of its commission, from placing the goods in the basket to the courier at the door.  We have a competent support service that will always help with advice in difficult times. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cda/738/7ad/cda7387ad6cc109565113d170629aa96.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  For lovers of shopping on their own, we provide mailforwarding services - we provide an address in the United States that can be purchased.  Several purchases made at different times and in different stores can also be combined in a warehouse in one package - this way you will be able to save a lot on delivery. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b3/66d/9f5/2b366d9f5e37620defe039dd0fc67351.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br><h3>  How much is it? </h3><br><br>  EbayToday services will cost you 10% of the order value for goods more expensive than $ 100 and $ 10 for purchases costing less than $ 100.  More information about prices for basic and additional services can be found on our website <a href="http://ebaytoday.ru/prices">here</a> .  To calculate the purchase price, we also have a convenient calculator: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be2/c91/35c/be2c9135ca176349a476e8dac1768d79.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br><h3>  Is it safe? </h3><br><br>  In general, yes, but there are, of course, some peculiarities. <br><br>  For example, large online stores value their reputation, so the risk of getting a marriage from there is almost zero. <br><br>  With eBay, the situation is more complicated.  At an online auction there is always a certain risk of running into a scammer who, instead of an iPhone, will send him a battered version or three rolls of toilet paper.  However, such cases are quite rare, and in order not to become a victim of fraud, it is enough to follow simple rules of caution. <br><br>  Mail can fail - it happens that the brave workers of this deliver the parcel for too long.  However, recently the situation and with this almost settled. <br><br>  When making large purchases more expensive than 10 000 rubles or buying something suspicious, various unpleasant questions may arise from Russian customs.  But if you correctly and honestly filled out the customs declaration and do not send 10 kilograms of cocaine in a package, then these difficulties are most often resolved after a visit to the customs terminal. <br><br>  So, although some difficulties sometimes happen, but for the most part they are completely solvable, and the process of shopping in the US using EbayToday is quite simple, pleasant and useful for you and your wallet.  We think that more than 50,000 successful purchases of our customers are a clear confirmation of this. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92944/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92944/</a></p>
