But, following her, I was faced with moments that required an ‚Äúextra digging.‚Äù  Having achieved the result, I usually wrote down a small instruction for myself for the future - so that next time I wouldn‚Äôt remember what I was doing, and not google info, but just read my own note.  So, I decided to put Opera Mini on my Asus EEE PC 901 with Eeebuntu. <br><br>  However, this method is suitable for any operating system ‚Äî Windows, OSX ‚Äî if only a Java machine runs under them. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>1. Some lyrics</b> <br><br>  The last 2 years on my laptops was Fedora.  At first it was familiar to me from Masterhosto hosting Fedora Core 4, then 7, 9 and finally Fedora 10. What made me change my beloved a few days ago with a stranger wearing the sultry African name Eeebuntu, so piquant for the Russian ear? <br><br>  Since mid-2008, I discovered the ideal for the size of my handbag and tasks (programming in C, J2ME, PHP, etc. - including on the road) class of devices - netbooks.  But, using Eee, you come across the need to take a file and bring up the axis every time you install the system, installing the drivers for the network card, WiFi module, etc., etc. ... Having discovered a week ago that the recently installed and ‚Äúdoped‚Äù Fedora 10 suddenly forgot how to work with a network card (‚Äúa colleague from Fedor‚Äù told me - ‚ÄúIt happens. It is treated simply by reinstallation‚Äù), I realized that my patience was over.  So on my Eee PC appeared Eeebuntu.  There were no problems - he immediately recognized both the network card and Wi-Fi, he did not offer to start a new user by entering a username / password in the irremovable Cyrillic layout, as Fyodor did ... In general, everything that I needed earned a distort. I did not have to take the file.  Well, after my software for work on the road was perfectly compiled and earned under the new axis, I realized that Eeebuntu is for a long time. <br><br>  <b>2. Configure GPRS</b> <br><br>  For GPRS connection, I used the wvdial utility. <br><br>  First, make sure that the bluetooth service is running (/etc/init.d/bluetooth status).  If necessary, change the bluetooth mode of the laptop from invisible to visible to other devices.  Unfortunately, I was not able to figure out how to do this from the console using the hciconfig utility - and I simply used the ‚Äúblue-tooth‚Äù icon in the Gnome system tray, selecting ‚ÄúPreferences‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúVisible and accessible to other devices‚Äù ("Always visible"). <br><br>  On the phone (I have listed the actions for the Nokia E61 phone), we will command: Menu -&gt; Communications -&gt; Bluetooth.  Go to the tab "paired devices."  Options -&gt; New Security System -&gt; New Search.  We will indicate our laptop in the list of detected devices and click on the "Select" on the phone.  An affirmative answer to the question "Allow automatic connection of the device?" The phone will offer to enter the secret digital code for communication.  Just do not enter something commonly used like "0000" or "1234"!  It is better to specify as a code the number of some phone of your friends.  A window appears on your computer asking you to enter a code.  Let's enter this code.  Again, click on the Bluetooth icon and switch the mode to ‚ÄúOther devices can connect‚Äù (‚ÄúHidden‚Äù).  Close the Bluetooth Settings window. <br><br>  After introducing the phone to the laptop, let's proceed to setting up a GPRS connection. <br><br>  Let's write the connection parameters in /etc/wvdial.conf.  In my case (MTS, Moscow) they turned out like this: <br><pre>  [Dialer mts]
 Modem = / dev / rfcomm2
 Phone = * 99 #
 Username = mts
 Password = mts
 Init2 = AT + CGDCONT = 1, "IP", "internet.mts.ru"
 ISDN = 0
 Auto Reconnect = on
 Stupid Mode = off
 Idle seconds = 0
 Auto DNS = on </pre><br><br>  By team <pre>  # sdptool browse </pre>  Find out which channel is used for modem connection: <br><pre>  # sdptool browse 
  ...
   Service Name: Dial-Up Networking
   Service RecHandle: 0x10052
   Service Class ID List:
   "Dialup Networking" (0x1103)
   Protocol Descriptor List:
     "L2CAP" (0x0100)
     "RFCOMM" (0x0003)
     Channel: 2
 ... </pre><br><br>  Switch the phone's bluetoooth mode to visible: Menu -&gt; Communication -&gt; Bluetooth -&gt; Access to phone -&gt; Accessible to all <br>  Find the bluetooth address of the phone, having commanded on the laptop: <br><pre>  $ hcitool scan
 Scanning ...
	 00: 12: D2: 14: A0: 2F Yana </pre><br>  Return the phone to the hidden mode. <br><br>  Add an entry for / dev / rfcomm2 to the /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf file, adding the following lines to it (of course, replacing the phone‚Äôs bluetooth address with your own): <br><pre>  rfcomm2 {
 # # Automatically bind the device at startup
	 bind yes;
 #
 # # Bluetooth address of the device
	 device 00: 12: D2: 14: A0: 2F;
 #
 # # RFCOMM channel for the connection
	 channel 2;
 #
 # # Description of the connection
	 comment "Modem (Nokia E61)";
 } </pre><br><br>  Reboot. <br><br>  Now, to establish a GPRS connection, it‚Äôs enough to command <pre>  $ sudo wvdial mts </pre><br><br>  <b>3. Install Java</b> <br><br>  The English manual suggested using one of the ‚Äúthird-party‚Äù Java implementations.  I‚Äôm working on mobile development, it‚Äôs easier for me to use my familiar <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Sun‚Äôs</a> .  I installed the <a href="https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start%3FProductRef%3Djdk-6u11-oth-JPR%40CDS-CDS_Developer">JDK (Java Development Kit)</a> .  If you are not involved in Java development, you can install a less ‚Äúvoluminous‚Äù <a href="https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start%3FProductRef%3Djre-6u11-oth-JPR%40CDS-CDS_Developer">JRE (Java Runtime Environment)</a> .  Since my netbook does not foresee other users, when installing the OS, I assign disks as follows: 4-gigabyte SSD- ‚Äúdisk‚Äù is mounted as ‚Äú/‚Äù, and 16-gigabyte SSD-scale - as ‚Äú/ home‚Äù.  So I installed the JDK in /home/yana/jdk1.6.0_11.  From the admin's point of view, this is a categorical lamination, however, you can do it right on your computer (I will be grateful for the advice on competently partitioning a netbook disk), but I have done as I prefer. <br><br>  <b>4. Emulator "mobile Java"</b> <br><br>  The official website of the <a href="http://microemu.org/">micro</a> - <a href="http://microemu.org/">emulator</a> is <a href="http://microemu.org/">microemu.org</a> .  We fall from it (Download -&gt; Releases) on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php%3Fgroup_id%3D30014">SourceForge.net</a> , from where we download the latest version of the microemulator.  Unzip the downloaded archive.  Now create a menu item to start the micro-emulator: System -&gt; Control Center (Preferences) -&gt; Main Menu -&gt; New Item.  In the opened window for setting a new menu item, we will write: <br>  Type: Application <br>  Name: MicroEmulator <br>  Command: <i>&lt;</i> java directory <i>path</i> <i>&gt;</i> / bin / java -jar <i>&lt;path to the directory where the</i> micro-emulator was <i>unpacked&gt;</i> /microemulator.jar <br><br>  In my case, the Command field looks like this: <pre>  /home/yana/jdk1.6.0_11/bin/java -jar /home/yana/Distr/microemulator/microemulator-2.0.3/microemulator.jar </pre><br><br>  <b>5. We put the Opera</b> <br><br>  Download the Opera Mini files.  With the help of the newly created menu item, we launch the micro-emulator.  An image of a mobile phone appears on the computer screen.  But surfing the web on a miniature virtual phone screen is somehow not comme il faut.  In the menu of the micro-emulator, select: Options -&gt; Select device ... -&gt; Add ... Select the directory where we unpacked the microemulator, and in it the devices directory.  In the list of files we will indicate microemu-device-resizable.jar.  In the list of devices, select ‚ÄúResizable device - russian keyboard‚Äù, click on ‚ÄúSet as default‚Äù and close the window of the list of devices: ‚ÄúOk‚Äù.  Now click on the ‚ÄúResize‚Äù button in the lower right corner of the window.  For the screen of my Asus Eee PC 901, I chose a width of 1010 and a height of 493 pixels.  Now we‚Äôll launch the Opera Mini: File -&gt; Open JAD File ... in the micro-emulator, specify the Opera Mini jad-file that we recently downloaded (later it will be possible to choose Opera Mini much faster: File:&gt; Recent MIDlets ...).  The line ‚ÄúOpera Mini‚Äù will appear in the emulator window - click on it.  Opera is running!  For convenience, in the Opera menu you can set the largest font: Menu -&gt; Tools -&gt; Options;  Font size: Very large. <br><br>  <b>6. Problems with the micro-emulator</b> <br><br>  The first problem I encountered is the inability to enter text.  Trying to enter a username, password or any other text on a web page, I got into a trap: click the mouse on either the left and right screen buttons ‚ÄúOk‚Äù and ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù, not at the corners of the program window, or Enter with Esc'eype nothing It did not help, I could not get back from the text entry window to the web page.  At the docks to the micro-emulator, nothing was found.  I tried to outwit the emulator by switching the emulated device from the Resizable device to the Default device.  On the screen of a netbook, instead of a large browser window, the image of a mobile phone with a tiny small screen and buttons reappears - and the right / left software is perfectly pressed by the mouse.  But after switching the device, the emulator resets the current application.  By typing, I managed to find out that the F1 and F2 keys correspond to the left and right softbattons. <br><br>  The second problem: in the text input boxes, you can print in Latin without any problems.  But the Cyrillic letters sometimes (often!) Simply cease to be entered.  The solution I found is not the most convenient, but quite working: after having printed the text in a text editor, I transfer it to the emulator using the usual copy / paste.  Inconvenient - but better than that. <br><br>  But I did not manage to upload files and copy text or URLs from the browser. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50875/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50875/</a></p>
