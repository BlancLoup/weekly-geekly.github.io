  <section class="page js-page"><h1>And how are things going with software management?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In August 2011, I published an article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/softline/blog/125470/">‚Äú <b>How to save on software,‚Äù</b></a> in the comments to which there were disputes, as well as some doubts about both the approach in general and specific examples in particular.  Of course, this can not but rejoice, because if there are questions to the material, then this at least means that it is not interesting to one person. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now I would like to talk not so much about concrete examples, figures and practical situations, but about SAM in general and about the attitude to this methodology.  If you look at the history of the development of this methodology in Russia, 5-6 years ago only a few knew the SAM abbreviation on the market, and even those referred to this methodology, primarily as a tool that helps only minimize legal risks when using software. <br><br>  Now most companies know what SAM is, they implement software asset management processes and automation tools in their companies.  At the same time, I note that now most of the enterprise companies, when they begin to talk about SAM, speak about processes, procedures and policies, and only in the next turn think about the tool with which they will automate this methodology. <br><br>  To a certain extent, this can be one of the indicators of the level of market growth.  Another equally important indicator is the growth in the number of SAM projects.  For example, if we take the quantitative expression of projects as a basis, their number in the Softline company in 2012 increased three times as compared with 2011.

      Some time ago, Softline conducted a small survey, the result of which showed that 35% of respondents absolutely understand the meaning of abbreviations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fa9/3a6/cb5/fa93a6cb5b18b0b64818dd83bd9ee01c.jpg"><br><br>  It should be noted that now the development of IT is leaps and bounds.  The experience borrowed from the global community has a positive effect on the functioning of IT across the organization.  Today, the IT department is viewed not as a technology provider, but as a full-fledged business partner that helps it achieve its business goals.  In this regard, it is worth mentioning the existence of an effective approach to the management of software assets, described in the international standard ISO 19770-1: 2012 (the previous version of this standard was dated 2006). <br><br>  Most IT departments seek to standardize and formalize their business processes.  And this is not just a tribute to fashion, it is a real need to optimize costs, restore order, and establish manageability.  At the same time, in order to experience the first benefits from SAM, you should not implement absolutely all the processes described in ISO 19770-1: 2012. <br><br>  Suffice it to attend to the introduction of the main ones: <br>  ‚Ä¢ identification of software assets; <br>  ‚Ä¢ management of accounting for software assets; <br>  ‚Ä¢ control (change) of software assets; <br>  ‚Ä¢ checking software asset accounts; <br>  ‚Ä¢ compliance with software licenses; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Compliance with security requirements for software assets. <br><br>  These 6 processes can be called basic.  Their implementation will allow the company to quickly move to a qualitatively new level of management of software assets and will give concrete tangible results. <br><br>  Speaking of results, Gartner notes that "the systematic management of the life cycle of IT assets will reduce the value of each asset by 30% during the first year and by 5-10% of each next." <br><br>  And how are things going with software management?  What is your attitude to this methodology?  It is the attitude that interests, and even at the level of ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù.  We offer to join and answer the questionnaire. <br>  By the way, now Softline offers absolutely free of charge to assess the level of maturity of SAM in any company and already now understand what and where you need to ‚Äúdig‚Äù in order to move to a more mature level.  For this you need to fill in a <a href="http://services.softline.ru/sam%3Futm_source%3Dvedomosti%26utm_medium%3Dtext%26utm_campaign%3Dsam2012">form for consultation.</a> <br><br>  Author: Vladimir Razuvaev, Director of Legal Support, Head <a href="http://services.softline.ru/sam-audit">of IT Asset Management, Softline</a> , Ph.D. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/161279/">https://habr.com/ru/post/161279/</a></p>
