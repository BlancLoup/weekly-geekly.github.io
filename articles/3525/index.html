  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cry from the heart</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I decided to express the cry of the soul. <br>  I remember school years, where in each class there were 1-2 future IT people.  When the school at the Olympiads was represented not by one person, but by the whole team.  What do we see now?  Rarely where you can find a truly talented student.  Now more html's pages rivet people can, yes pictures in Photoshop.  Although I do not argue, there are experts in these areas, but I'm no longer about the design, but about the development.  And not necessarily the development of "pages" of such "specialists" are now like mushrooms.  As they say "about everything and about anything really." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What is being done in specialized educational institutions?  Yes, there are still such, but they also became less.  It is worth talking to teachers from there to understand what they mean.  And what will happen next?  And then with such progress worse. <br><br>  <b>Why?</b> <br>  Everything is really simple.  IT-technologies are becoming more accessible.  Easier to use.  But their internal implementation becomes more complicated.  That's the problem.  If it becomes more difficult for a young explorer of numbers to understand the device and easier to use, will he go into details?  Of course not.  Why am I going to learn algorithms in my free time?  It's easier for me to concoct a page.  When a question arises, for example, on the development of a complex WEB-resource, the problem of personnel emerges here.  Many guys come to work to get settled.  And it seems with such confidence that the ocean is knee-deep.  But in fact, the specialists of the necessary qualifications are becoming less and less.  This is where (in fact, not only for this reason) such tasks in enterprises, which imply the standard requirement of pattern, component.  In other words, accessibility for the modern average "developer".  To make it easier to tighten the nuts and, if necessary, change.  And such nuts, you know, are now full.  In general, ‚Äúlook there, copy here, it should work‚Äù.  The Hindu method of developing Copy &amp; Paste, as Umputun told in one of his podcasts about his subordinates. <br><br>  <b>And what next?</b> <br>  So imagine with such a development of education, how many specialists will we master and develop such things as Yadis, GSS, OpenID, XDI, XRI, XPI?  And this is only one area.  And so everywhere.  Technologies are growing not only ‚Äúin depth‚Äù, but also ‚Äúin breadth‚Äù.  Conclusion one.  Bearded experienced guys will bring all these wonders so that you can use a group of narrow specialists. <br>  Probably the times of people-heroes are over, covering a large area of ‚Äã‚ÄãIT with their wide knowledge.  Now it is more difficult, now IT is a whole world in which you can only understand everything superficially.  And so, in order to conduct complex development, a whole department of narrow specialists is already needed.

      Why cry from the heart?  Because, I believe, such lonely heroes may appear.  They can be grown.  You just need to change the approach in our education system.  Our education was spoiled by the technology itself chtoli.
