Bright, sharp and fair assessments are immediately minus. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It turns out some mechanism of the crowd or the mass consciousness.  But it is clear that the average estimate cannot be correct.  No wonder they invented a hierarchy, because the crowd can not make effective decisions. <br><br>  Many pioneers write about their first experience of creating a project, programming.  In the comments some positive feedback.  People who express their opinions, sharply minus. <br>  Where does the karma mechanism lead?  Survive the fittest, whose opinion is most averaged.  Together with the trolls and hooligans minus experts, who sometimes give harsh but fair assessments. <br><br>  Where does all this go?

      The quality of the material on Habr√© has recently fallen, it‚Äôs not interesting to read about the geic joys of owning another miracle device, with no analysis ... Dumb examples of using code, etc. <br>  Web 2.0 plays as content to specialized publications, where there are mechanisms ed.  colleges and expert assessments of the article, and finishes all the mechanism of karma ... <br><br>  And one more thing online communication.  A good coder‚Äôs commentary or a novice student‚Äôs commentary has absolutely equal power.  There is no connection with reality.  You can produce virtuals. <br>  As a result, even if a novice student says the right (seemingly) things, it is not a fact that they are true, since  he just hit the sky with his finger or can say logical things, but far from the wrong. <br><br>  That is, there is no mechanism for assessing the experience of the interlocutor in the online environment.  If everyone in the profile had a resume, a list of successes, then it would be possible to indirectly evaluate his experience and knowledge. <br>  In general, introduce a peer review mechanism. <br>  When will quantity begin to turn into quality?  :) <br><br>  What to do? <br><br>  On Habr√© I sit myself, in a huge amount of aisle, valuable things come across. <br>  I see a trend - quality is falling, everyone needs Kama, everything is around Kama, but we need quality content, even if copy-past (I understand what resource owners want by banning copy-paste, we will get rewriting).  We need the opinions of professionals, we need guilds. <br><br>  I would like to read about the experience of real projects, people who make good money on the Internet or produce cool products, without beauty, without success stories (where only good things are remembered, but not the truth).  And we get a bunch of pioneers who write about the first steps and drive karma into each other. <br><br>  Here's an idea for Habr - an interview with Bolotov or other successful people in runet in the online conference mode, let them talk about their recipes (will they? :). <br><br>  Idea number two is the editors mechanism.  Anyone can add articles to favorites, you can watch this collection.  Here is a clever man noted for himself this, this and this.  I read ... <br><br>  <b>UPDATE</b> <br><br>  Here are some more ideas. <br><br>  1. Everyone can in his personal blog cancel the minus, etc. <br>  2. Everyone has a signature next to their nickname - age, occupation and experience.  A completely different picture is obtained in the comments, and then to enter the profile for 15 years old - a lot of clicks ... <br><br>  PS Well, how many times have I told myself not to waste time trying to prove something to someone?  Sit and go about your business, why try to improve someone else's project, why waste your efforts outside?  Everything, more than a single post, all this nonsense ... <br><br>  <b>UPDATE 2</b> <br><br>  After reflection, I came to the following conclusions.  Slightly dropped out of reality, everything has been invented.  :) <br><br>  1. Smart people will transfer their experience only for money (seminars, lectures), only seeds will be published in open form. <br><br>  2. The web 2.0 mechanism leads to ‚Äúyellowing‚Äù in the presentation of material.  The best must be carefully sorted and saved as a collection on a specific topic.  The mechanism of prizes again aggravates holivars, creates cheating, populism, etc.  The transition to the payment of materials is also not an option, it will lead to a change in format. <br><br>  3. Karma introduces confusion because of the term itself, which reflects good and evil.  Rename karma to popularity and there will be less holivars and a fight for a just cause.  The term itself encourages action ... <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39733/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39733/</a></p>
