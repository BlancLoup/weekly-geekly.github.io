A good programmer always learns, and therefore grows in professionalism and price.  It also drives the IT industry, which is rapidly changing and requires fresh blood from developers.  Fresh and qualified.  So, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm">BLS predicts</a> that by 2026 the demand for programmers will grow by 24%, and the turnover rate in IT is <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/software-had-the-highest-job-turnover-rate-of-any-industry-in-2017/">already higher</a> than in retail stores.  Because along with the need for personnel, the requirements for them are growing. <br><br>  So, if you were waiting for a sign to start pumping, then here it is.  And to whom this is not enough, keep <a href="https://tech.co/5-signs-need-improve-coding-skills-2015-02">5 signs of a</a> programmer's frostiness. <br><br><ol><li>  Your code is poorly understood by colleagues, and if you have to make changes to it, then everything breaks down. </li><li>  You yourself are afraid of approaching and changing someone else's code. </li><li>  You solve problems arising in work for too long, and writing code for you is a struggle, not a pleasure. </li><li>  You are not interested, but scary to learn new programming languages. </li><li>  You hardly explain your tasks to your tech-colleagues and do not know how to talk about working with humanities from marketing. </li></ol><br>  Do you recognize yourself in at least one point?  You need to urgently change something.

    <h3>  First steps to resolve </h3><br>  Understanding the problem is already good.  But leap skills not to take.  You will start with enthusiasm, but quickly exhale, and with it your growth will stop.  Facebook blogger Joma Tech <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dle_NLSXWt1E">believes</a> that for constant change, everyone needs a system.  We tell the points how to build it. <br><br>  <b>Change your approach</b> <br><br>  Vacations are over, it's time to work.  You need to implant in your head an understanding that pumping skills is not temporary, it should always be so.  It will be difficult, sometimes painful, but over time, every step forward will add strength. <br><br>  <b>Create habits</b> <br><br>  Someone advises to allocate 20% of working time for development, someone thinks that 15 minutes per day is enough.  Joma says that it takes 3 weeks to form a habit.  Determine how much time you can spend studying every day and do not give up at least 21 days. <br><br>  <b>Set deadlines</b> <br><br>  Fix big goals, cut them into small sub-goals and set your time limit before reaching each.  It will be good if other people find out about this plan - for example, a timlid who is ready to put you on a new project.  Responsibility is a good motivator. <br><br><h3>  Where to download online </h3><br>  Choose the appropriate level, stack and comfort format.

The books describe the basics you need to know, and sometimes do not interfere with and re-read.  Perhaps with a new experience, you will otherwise see fundamental truths. </li><li>  <b>Learn someone else's code</b> .  Open-source solutions and open libraries are a wealth of experience.  Read the code of the best engineers, try to understand why it is written this way and not otherwise.  And then try to repeat - write the studied code from scratch yourself.  Principles of good programming will fall quietly in the head, but firmly. </li><li> <b>Participate in offline events</b> .  Hakatons, mitapes and competitions - all this activates the brain and teaches us to look for solutions to problems in stressful situations and in a short time.  Burning deadline at work will no longer scare you. </li></ol><br>  And if you do not give a damn about <b>software skills</b> , then: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Work not alone</b> .  Team up with more experienced developers, join big projects and community.  The ability to work in a team is highly valued by IT giants.  Besides, you better learn how to explain a technical problem and pronounce its solution.  A fresh look at your code errors that you yourself do not notice. </li><li>  <b>Share your experience</b> .  You can write a blog, teach courses and speak at conferences.  When you teach others, you will feel responsible, which means you will be thoroughly prepared for possible questions and try to look at your usual knowledge from a different angle.  As a result, you will thoroughly understand the issue, plus develop communication, expertise and self-presentation skills. </li></ol><br><h3>  Eventually </h3><br>  Continuous development will help to become a productive and expensive specialist, and most importantly - dispel the routine.  Or maybe you will become that very <a href="https://medium.com/%40deepusnath/top-4-qualities-of-a-10x-programmer-e57f87663de3">super-programmer</a> who works like 10 ordinary ones?  In any case, let it be a bonus, not a goal. <br><br>  Make mistakes, ask questions, take calls and do not be afraid of criticism and loss.  Take tasks as entertainment, and complexity as the heaviness of tired legs in front of a new step.  After all, pumping skills just make you cooler. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/424329/">https://habr.com/ru/post/424329/</a></p>
