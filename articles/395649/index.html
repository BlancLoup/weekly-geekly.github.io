In this article I would like to tell you how the main developer of Sailfish OS - Jolla is doing what happened to her during the year.  I would also like to write about the latest OS version, looking at my <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/260512/">old review</a> , i.e.  what has changed relative to the old version.  About personal use experience and mood, have I not been disappointed in this purchase?  And a little more about various trifles ... Well, well, if you're interested, then let's go! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  1. How is Jolla? </h4><br>  Over the year, quite a lot of things happened, but let's do it in chronological order.

      Autumn 2015 - Jolla releases the long-awaited update to Sailfish OS 2.0 (which I will discuss below).  Tablet backers are waiting for delivery information ... <br>  Also, they declare themselves exclusively software company. <br><br>  December 2015 - Jolla has financial problems, because they did not give them money in one of the rounds of financing.  They cut half of the state (I didn‚Äôt understand they fired them then at all or temporarily). <br>  I will not torment you, in the next round of funding Jolla received the money. <br><br>  Winter-spring of 2016 - December did not pass without a trace ... Updates stopped coming out (i.e., the last update was currently somewhere in January).  <b>UPD: in May a small update was released under version 2.0.1.11 in a stable branch.</b>  Jolla says that not everyone who paid for the tablet will receive it (not only because of financial problems, but also because part of the components have been taken out of production), those who do not receive will be given back some (!) Money.  The last shipment of a batch of tablets is scheduled for spring-summer. <br><br>  Also Jolla finds partners who will be engaged in iron: <br>  -Fairphone 2 <br>  -Intex Aqua Fish <br>  -Oysters SF <br>  -Russian company "Open Mobile Platform" is also rumored to be preparing the device, and also seems to be involved in the development of the platform itself <br><br>  The <a href="https://sailfishos.org/">site with documentation</a> for Sailfish OS has been updated quite well. <br><br>  In May, Jolla announced that it would release a limited batch of a phone called Jolla C, which is positioned as a phone for ardent fans and developers. <br><br>  In general, at the moment, judging by my feelings and their twitter, Jolla has high hopes for Intex and emerging markets. <br><br><h4>  2. Sailfish OS 2.0.1.11 </h4><br>  There are a lot of changes, but the most important: Oh my God!  They removed the rounding on the edges of the display and on the cover` applications ... Well, let's survive.  :) <br><br>  Let's start with the lock screen: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d43/ff4/9c9/d43ff49c976943a3a20e8e396e98d46f.jpg"><br>  Now it is unlocked by svaypami left / right, but I have been configured as follows: to the right - I immediately get to the "events" window, and to the left - to the main screen.  Also screwed the current date, day of the week and player control, if it is enabled. <br><br>  Meet  New window "events": <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8c/b74/729/f8cb7472997b42f78a07920b10aca5c5.jpg"><br>  Now all events are displayed here.  And also the weather is displayed for 5 days (optional). <br>  Svayp example: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/105/d7c/984/105d7c9841ae4913952485d4106b2d8c.jpg"><br><br>  If you make the swipe from the "events" window from top to bottom, then we will get into the so-called (in the Android system) notification panel: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42e/2a1/7eb/42e2a17eb9cf4b0b8375b023d3a855f3.jpg"><br>  Here, the management of the main functionality of the phone and also added ‚Äúquick actions‚Äù (like take a selfie), this window is fully customizable. <br><br>  Home screen or "Home": <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/897/3db/c83/8973dbc8346e4e9a8212beba5c81372a.jpg"><br>  As you can see, they added a small bar on top, removed the launcher from below. <br>  Now it can accommodate more than 9 applications and can be shaken: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fae/bdc/b2a/faebdcb2ad4b4cc7afcd9cd06ff5de72.jpg"><br>  By the way, to manage applications from this screen, you do not need to make mini-swipes, about which I wrote in the last review.  You just need to press a button. <br><br>  Now, from any running application, you can get into the launcher from the bottom up (the landscape mode is shown): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/847/db5/763/847db5763f3d4a948a037245ee17f1b1.jpg"><br><br>  Added support for Dropbox to Accounts (I did not try it myself, I‚Äôm using a native third-party application, but in general, lately I‚Äôm mainly using syncthing): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c8/cb6/b0e/5c8cb6b0ebb8406faa30e97a42e54730.jpg"><br><br>  Having made the swipe from top to bottom in the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù we will get into the lock screen: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4a/650/61b/e4a65061ba174682baf6ee1d9532b14d.jpg"><br>  You can also quickly change the current phone theme (ringtone, colors, background image, volume settings, etc.). <br>  In general, a controversial feature, on the one hand, they opened a new mode ‚Äúwithout sound‚Äù, on the other hand, this place could be taken by the same notification panel.  This is all implemented by the patch ‚ÄúQuick settings on power menu‚Äù from openrepos.  True, on the latest version of the OS, this patch has fallen off for me, it is possible that it was necessary to roll it back before updating the phone ... <br><br>  Example of album mode: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ded/c8a/595/dedc8a595b6942bcafda32918c7faa08.jpg"><br><br>  <i>I don‚Äôt remember to mention all the little things, so if you have any questions or need additional screenshots, you MUST write in the comments.</i> <br><br><h4>  3. The most visible problems solved in the platform with respect to the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/260512/">old review.</a> </h4><br>  -The new ‚Äúevents‚Äù window has become much better, now all missed events, reminders, messages, weather, etc. are displayed there. <br>  -Finally, they took out the controls of wi-fi, bluetooth and other peripherals into a separate ‚Äúwindow‚Äù (it used to be in the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù application) <br>  -Android messengers are now able to send push-notifications from the background mode <br>  -Added support for landscape mode for applications. <br>  - A bunch of small fixes and features that you do not remember ... <br><br><h4>  4. We will talk heart to heart ... </h4><br>  About my current attitude to this system, for a year some fanaticism has passed and there is just some kind of friendly attitude towards this OS, so I think that this review turned out to be even more objective;). <br>  Yes, there is some dampness (in a diminutive form), but for me personally, the presented functionality is almost completely missing (which is lacking described below).  At the same time, some OS chips are really fun.  In particular: <br>  -Manage swipe. <br>  People, I really now can not use all sorts of android phones!  I can not without gestures!  It turns out that this is so native thing, as I do not know ... I do not know what to compare with ... <br>  -Console and the spirit of a Unix-like OS <br>  No comments. <br>  -Ta most real multitasking <br>  Of course on cell phones is not so important, but in some cases it helps. <br>  -User and developer community <br>  You are ready to help, in your open source application will surely be a pull request.  The lack of documentation is covered by the open source of most applications. <br>  Despite the fact that (at least for now?), There is no commercial interest to create applications for Sailfish OS, the community creates really very original applications. <br>  -Thank you QML / C ++, which prolongs the life of my phone from a single charge <br>  - If I honestly don‚Äôt know how to react to this, but in the company‚Äôs application store there is a manual application check.  People check our apps!  I do not know how long it will last, but I saw moments when a representative of the store informed the developer that he had a bug somewhere in the program! <br>  -And many more small things that are so included in the "everyday life" that you can not formulate ... <br><br><h4>  5. Summary </h4><br>  Yes, there is still a lot to do.  But let's see what is already there?  With small forces (!), We managed to create a user-friendly, gikofrendli;), stable (pah-pah-pah) environment (by ‚Äúmedium‚Äù here I mean both graphical shell, the OS itself, and the community).  I think that this fact alone is worthy of respect. <br>  This is what is, and what will be up to us! <br><br><h4>  6. Devices with Sailfish OS support that are on sale or will be on sale. </h4><br>  -Fairphone 2 <br>  -Intex Aqua Fish (official support) <br>  -Ports: Nexus, OnePlus X (they say that a good port) <br>  -Oysters SF <br><br><h4>  7. Bonus: About the Russian national mobile OS. </h4><br>  It is also interesting that Sailfish OS was chosen as the basis for the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275406/">national mobile OS</a> .  I do not know where this will lead, but I am sure of one thing: for sure it will give an additional impetus to the development of this system.  Also, of all the ‚Äúprojects‚Äù of the national OS, this <b>looks the</b> most realistic. <br><br><h4>  8. Bonus number 2 </h4><br>  I can still tell you about the development experience under Sailfish OS, but I have to warn you that, firstly, I‚Äôm not yet very skilled as a programmer, secondly, the program was rather modest in functionality, and, thirdly, I don‚Äôt know what style to write.  So, if a new article is needed, then write what you would like it to be.  :) <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  There is a small personal question: how do you like my writing style?  Is it good to read or something needs to be corrected? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395649/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395649/</a></p>
