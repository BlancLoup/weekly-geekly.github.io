What makes a visitor to make their choice in favor of a particular company?  And it's not even about giving your money at the last sales step, but at least calling. <br><br>  Getting to an unfamiliar site, the first thing that visitors are trying to understand is whether this is a real company and whether it can be trusted.  It was safety, and not price, that turned out to be the most important factor for all new customers.  Only after he was convinced that this was a real company, was the transition to the search for prices. <br><br>  The reality of the company is usually confirmed by images that prove that your business is real.  It can be: <br><ul><li>  photography works </li><li>  certificates </li><li>  scans of customer reviews </li><li>  photos of your office and employees. </li></ul><br><br>  Here are some examples from a home building site: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/876/d7c/a1a/876d7ca1a344493d94f0551529cfcb35.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea7/e9c/caa/ea7e9ccaa96f4dc4b7e6983b9897660e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The story of a car dealership selling used cars has become very significant for us.  The horrible black website with the animation of the 90s gave two times more applications than the new site in a modern style.  What was their main difference?  On the "Gypsy" version on all pages there was a huge photo of the car market itself.  In poor quality, in the winter and with heaps of garbage in the foreground.  But it was she who inspired the visitor‚Äôs confidence, because he understood that yes, that‚Äôs what the average car market looks like.  And that for sure their owners are very far from the basics of web design.  So he picked up the phone and called. <br><br>  At the same time, an expensive new site with beautiful illustrations gave many times fewer calls. <br><br><blockquote>  Add to the site more images from the life of the company. </blockquote><br><br><h5>  <b>Intriguing information</b> </h5><br>  It is always important to balance the quality and quantity of information on the site.  On the one hand, you need to make sure that the landing page answers most customer questions. <br><br>  You can not give the visitor the feeling that he learned everything that is needed.  Indeed, in most cases, the difference among the competitors is minimal and allowing the visitor to leave to compare the conditions on another site is almost equivalent to losing it. <br><br><blockquote>  The most important thing that any potential customer is looking for is prices. </blockquote><br><br>  Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to provide the visitor with a convenient price list, on the other hand, to offer him a communication tool of this price list.  Here the calculator becomes the most interesting solution. <br><br>  However, experiments on all sites proved that having a complex calculator on a site that gives a near-realistic calculation increases conversion much worse than a calculator simulator that asks the client 3-4 basic questions and then offers to enter a phone number to get a calculation. <br><br>  Example from a site for garbage collection: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3aa/ba4/f42/3aaba4f422244241b9b3d2b6d85cfe4c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After all, what does the majority, having received a specific price offer?  Goes to compare with competitors.  And for any business, it is important to have direct contact with the visitor as soon as possible. <br><br>  Therefore, the ‚Äúpseudo-calculator‚Äù who gives leads has proven to be much more efficient than real calculations. <br><br>  We want to further emphasize that it is this type of calculator that gives the greatest increase in orders.  In some cases, the increase in monthly profit reached 25%.  After all, a calculator is essentially a set of frequently asked questions on the phone.  As a result, managers receive hot applications with completed primary information. <br><br><h5>  <b>Accumulate knowledge</b> </h5><br>  Having tested various interactive and informational elements on different sites, we have identified two main groups that give maximum effect. <br><br>  <b>1. Increased confidence</b> <br><ul><li>  Portfolio (examples of works) </li><li>  Official documents (certificates and licenses) </li><li>  Customer reviews </li></ul><br><br>  <b>2. Increase conversion</b> <br><ul><li>  Prices and calculator </li><li>  Visible contact form </li><li>  Promotion or discount </li></ul><br><br><blockquote>  As a result, we collected all these items into a single interactive widget, which showed the best result: </blockquote><br><br>  An example of a widget on the site for opening locks <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/164/4a7/c1a/1644a7c1a96345d288c889cfb6cc7679.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  <b>Analyzing the effect</b> </h5><br>  Heat maps from Yandex.Metriches have confirmed that such widgets contain very important information for any visitor.  After implementation, they became the most clickable element of the site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef0/e33/44d/ef0e3344d94b4fd88db5a350322b2bd2.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/455/367/e2e/455367e2e424413698af9730f6acdcc6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The calculator had the greatest effect on sales growth everywhere.  Recall that we did not make any calculations, but simply laid out a few questions, broken down into steps with an imitation of the calculation at the end. <br><br>  Having received from the visitor 3-4 answers to the most important questions, the manager already on the phone can say the approximate cost and during the call adjust it to the requirements of the client. <br><br><h5>  <b>results</b> </h5><br>  Absolutely all sites showed an increase in orders.  We carried out comparisons in the cuts of one week to exclude seasonal fluctuations. <br><br><blockquote>  Most importantly, we do not take orders from classic channels.  Phone calls do not become less.  But we capture the attention of those who would have left without calling. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf2/965/bac/cf2965bacb294f98ab30bd544e01eb2d.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/451/eae/de1/451eaede1df24d4683780a845cb776d4.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  <b>How to do it in 10 minutes</b> </h5><br>  Having dealt with experimental sites and having received a tangible increase in sales, we were faced with the task of integrating similar functionality to other own and client projects. <br><br>  It seemed to us that it was wrong to develop the design and functionality for each project and we made an internal service to increase the conversion, calling it <a href="http://meedget.ru/">meedget.ru</a> <br><br>  In it, every manager of our company could independently configure the required set of functions for the widget and integrate it with a simple script on the site. <br><br>  Now we decided to open the service for public access.  Now you can <a href="http://meedget.ru/">try to increase your conversion yourself</a> today. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286798/</a></p>
