Responsible choice </h5><br>  I stared at the network data warehouses for a very long time, however, the lack of the necessary amount of free financial resources stopped a little.  At the first stage I studied manufacturers.  The stage ended very quickly and with an unambiguous conclusion: <b>Synology taxis !!!</b> <br>  After a long time I looked closely at the model range, considering together 3 parameters: the number of compartments for the disks inside, the price and the performance. <br>  At first, I looked at the <a href="http://www.synology.com/products/product.php%3Fproduct_name%3DDS211%252B%26lang%3Drus">DS211 +</a> , unconsciously realizing that 1.6 GHz and 512 MB of DDR3 RAM is the key to excellent performance.  But considering the almost identical cost with a four-section counterpart of the ‚Äúyounger weight category‚Äù, he chose the quantity (volume), sacrificing performance (I will write about it a bit later - in the third part). <br>  By the media player, I, in fact, had only two requirements: omnivorous and IPTV.  The presence of a separate NAS eliminated the need for a player with the ability to install the hard drive inside (I'm still in favor of the fact that for specific tasks it is very desirable to use the tools specifically designed for this purpose).  Actually, these two requirements practically minimized the possible list of devices, the overwhelming majority of which contained the letters ‚ÄúDune‚Äù in the title;) The chosen option turned out to be an elegant solution for my preferences. <br><h5>  Part 2. Euphoria from unpacking boxes </h5><br>  In short, both companies met expectations: high-quality packaging with the necessary set of content for a simple start. <br>  There was only one specific nuance when unpacking the media player.  I ordered a version with built-in WiFi, but the box unpacked from the shipping package did not contain the desired letters in the name label ... At first, I fell into a stupor, but after opening the box, my fears disappeared: there was a connector on the back end for connecting an external antenna, in other ways The antenna itself was also available. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a23/d0e/180/a23d0e1802a5db8ae545621b4b7577c3.jpg" alt="image"><br><h5>  Part 3. First impressions of work </h5><br>  First of all, I installed a screw in the NAS: Seagate ST2000DL003 - green series, quiet and cold.  After turning on the power, I installed the system from a disk: quickly, simply, using the supplied software. <br>  Subjectively: DS411j is loaded for a fairly long time, about 1.5.2.2 minutes.  A little sad, but not critical, because  turns off only in critical situations. <br>  And here, after the first inclusion of the already installed system, I thoughtlessly launched a full scan of the new hard drive ... 8 hours crossed out of my life; (... <br>  However, not taking into account the process of complete verification - all other operations on the creation of a partition and its connection were carried out very quickly. <br>  It makes no sense to talk about the DSM - there is something to read about it (Bumburum got here ...). <br>  Now, about the speed of work: the download of torrents on average is carried out at a speed of about 4-5 MB per second.  Moreover, as it turned out experimentally, the number of active downloads does not affect the speed (and 2..3 simultaneous downloads, and about 40 downloads showed the same speed).  Another thing that surprised me was that in the overwhelming majority of active torrent downloads, the total number of peers and seeds was 9..10 pieces.  Very rarely - 11. Perhaps it is software-wired restrictions, taking into account weak iron.  FTP and Windows drive files at an average of 35..40 MB per second, which, in general, is quite enough for my modest needs. <br>  With the distribution of all a lot more sad.  The maximum stable speed that I managed to see in a week of use is about half a megabyte per second.  Well, okay, let's survive: the Chukchi is not sitting a Chukchi feast;) Our business is to swing and watch !!! <br>  Now smoothly go to the media player.  Right off the bat ... <br>  With the firmware available in the player, problems were noticed when playing files (any of them) when connecting via WiFi.  Moreover, the connection itself didn‚Äôt indicate any visible problems: the WPA2-PSK didn‚Äôt make any difficulties for the player, and the player correctly connected to the router using the ‚Äún‚Äù protocol - 300 Mbps, allowing you to climb the wilds of the Windows and NAS balls in LAN ... <br>  However, when the Internet first appeared inside the player, he correctly hinted at the need to update the firmware, finding one on its website.  However, the lack of any drive prevented the upgrade (you can insert a 2.5-inch screw into the player, connect screws and USB sticks via USB, use an SD card).  By inserting a USB flash drive, I gave the player the opportunity to upgrade using temporarily its space.  It should be noted that after downloading, unpacking and uploading firmware from a flash drive, all created and used files were carefully deleted. <br>  The new firmware has given a new "face" and the absence of a previously detected glitch. <br>  With regard to the features of playing movies with NASa, we can note a smooth forward forward at a maximum of 4th speed, and jerks at any rewind.  Apparently, the transmission of information over the network affects what will not be (something tells me) when using the internal screw. <br>  Subjectively, I can say the following about the use of the player: everything is fine, it is only heated: the chip uses an external metal case as a radiator, and when continuously operating for 3-4 hours or more, it heats up significantly (subjectively up to 40 degrees). <br><h5>  Instead of conclusions </h5><br>  In the end, I got what I wanted, and a little more.  From the merits of all this iron disgrace can distinguish the following: <br><ul><li>  quiet NAS; </li><li>  cold NAS (the hard drive temperature did not exceed 35..37 degrees); </li><li>  capacious NAS on 4 winchesters; </li><li>  lack of hemorrhoids when working / updating / configuring NAS (DSM charms); </li><li>  A bunch of DSM bells and whistles, including web servers with PCP and muscle, a media server, a photo server, and many other goodies; </li><li>  silent player; </li><li>  omnivorous player; </li><li>  IPTV player (my provider broadcasts 140 channels under license (!)); </li><li>  beautiful player; </li></ul><br>  Disadvantages: <br><ul><li>  poor NAS performance; </li><li>  The player can not reproduce the images of BD, but this function is not declared, you have to download remuxes. </li></ul><br>  However, the first drawback is a consequence of the conscious choice of price to the detriment of performance, and the second can be dealt with by connecting an external blue-ray drive via USB. <br>  Well, actually, and the whole story.  Ready to answer any questions. </div>
