In other words, we did not strive to make the character's skin look realistic.  The same was true of hair - writing a separate shader for this purpose was not part of the project‚Äôs objectives. <br>  In addition, we had to make sure that the environment corresponded to the image of the main character.  We already had an environment that we showed in the Viking Village demo, so we decided to reuse some resources in order to save working time.  Thus, for the character was already chosen the setting.  And this led us to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãturning to Scandinavian mythology in search of interesting characters and plots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/049/1dd/c95/0491ddc955ad4d30b679b6832f9c1095.jpg"><br>  <i>Concept art.</i>  <i>Early sketches.</i> <br><br>  Perhaps you have already guessed what literary source formed the basis for the image of the blacksmith - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C_%25D0%25BE_%25D0%2592%25D1%2591%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5">‚ÄúSong of Volund‚Äù</a> - a work from the collection of Old Norse songs ‚ÄúThe Elder Edda‚Äù.  The colorful images of blacksmiths and the overlapping plots can also be found in the Finnish poetic epic <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0">‚ÄúKalevala‚Äù</a> .  Exploring the historical and mystical significance of the blacksmith in the mythology and folklore of Indo-European peoples, we were fascinated by how this ambiguous image combines various elements that make it attractive, but at the same time emphasize its dark side.  We decided that this is exactly what we need - an image reminiscent of many modern villains in cinema and literature who can not leave anyone indifferent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/448/609/aaf/448609aafbe54139afad96b6167d484d.jpg"><br>  <i>Concept art.</i>  <i>Sketches.</i> <br><br>  As part of the visual development of the character, we worked closely with concept artist <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artist/calader">George Simeonov</a> .  George proposed many interesting ideas and showed several ways to depict hair as part of a human silhouette using elements such as strips of skin or a hood. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12b/e4f/d53/12be4fd5300449f99d32b6a44a5efd68.jpg"><br>  <i>Concept art.</i>  <i>Sketches.</i> <br>  When creating the main character, we explored and rethought many mythological images.  The collected material influenced not only the decoration, but also the plot of the video.  In addition, we focused on other multifaceted and unusual literary characters, such as Morfey from the The Sandman comic book series (Sandman) Neil Gaiman and Judge Holden from Blood Meridian novel (Bloody Meridian) Cormac McCarthy. <br><br>  Here is the last approved concept art of the protagonist The Blacksmith: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/358/d80/211/358d80211d5847969616006318483124.png"><br>  <i>Concept art.</i>  <i>Approved version.</i> <br><br>  We assigned <a href="http://jonas.cgsociety.org/">Jonas Thornquist to</a> develop the model and textures for the character.  Jonas did an excellent job, created a model and visualized with VRay - and this is what he did: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/681/745/2af/6817452afde74ee1ae1565886b825ab5.jpg"><br>  <i>Blacksmith.</i>  <i>The original render of a high poly model, made in VRay.</i> <br><br>  <b>Antagonist</b> <br><br>  We considered the potential possibility of creating a short film and decided to expand the project a bit.  As a result, we not only abandoned the initial technical restrictions on the main character, but also added another character. <br>  According to the idea, the antagonist is a battle-hardened warrior, in whose image the Old Norse and anachronic elements are deliberately combined.  In the work on the concept and design of this character, we collaborated with <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artist/tonzy">Sergey Samuilov</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06b/1ee/954/06b1ee9548f3409c8a680d364eeb62c3.png"><br>  <i>Antagonist.</i>  <i>Original render, made in Marmoset Toolbag 2.</i> <br><br>  <b>Environment</b> <br><br>  The environment from the <a href="http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/02/18/working-with-physically-based-shading-a-practical-approach/">Viking Village</a> video was still in development and, of course, we wanted to use ready-made resources.  However, from the very beginning it was obvious that they would have to be organized differently.  In the video The Blacksmith, we wanted to create a more dramatic atmosphere.  The environment was supposed to complement the plot of our video and fit well with the individual characteristics and history of the characters. <br>  In order to convey this idea to our team and other employees, we have made several illustrations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c38/cbc/8be/c38cbc8be5d64479833fdd20cc436613.png"><br>  <i>Illustrations for video.</i> <br><br>  The development of the concept of the environment took very little time.  We limited ourselves to a few quick sketches, and then switched to iteration in Unity, until we stopped at the appropriate version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac5/eb8/e82/ac5eb8e82bf34fd4b73f853f30795208.png"><br><br>  When creating the landscape, we collaborated with Terragen <a href="http://www.cgscenery.com/">expert</a> Martin Huisman, entrusting him with procedural generation of highly detailed stone textures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/97e/a60/cbb/97ea60cbb5e345d2bb2f10029cdee771.jpeg"><br>  <i>All the stones in this image are rotated scaled samples of the same source.</i> <br><br>  <b>Create a clip</b> <br><br>  In the first phase of the project, we made a storyboard.  As a result, we have a lot of new ideas that we shared with the production team.  Thanks to working with Unity, we did not have to block access to the storyboard at an early stage - the engine provides the ability to load resources in real time, which allows editing individual frames even at the final stages.  Without much effort, we explored a number of modifications and adaptations of our original idea, made technical changes and even slightly modified the story until the final project deadline. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f52/a93/25f/f52a9325fe5d4a21985cf42ee4463003.jpg"><br>  <i>Storyboard</i>  <i>Early version.</i> <br><br>  The subsequent stages of work looked like this: <br>  First, we made pilot samples of some key frames.  To experience the length and rhythmic development of the video, we used a ready-made animated 2D storyboard.  In addition, we identified additional tools and shaders that could be useful to us. <br>  Then we moved on to developing a prototype environment in Unity using preliminary versions of resources, including character models.  We also used them when working with visuals, and pre-visualization in 3D served as a good reference for actors in the motion-capture studio. <br>  After filming, we post-processed the animation, exported it to Unity, and performed chronological synchronization along with additional frame iterations.  In the meantime, the artist began to replace the preliminary resources in the engine with newer ones, while working on lighting and post-effects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74e/544/a40/74e544a401f740aaafd8c5e5a4934c5e.png"><br>  <i>Frame structure.</i>  <i>Sketch;</i>  <i>2D animatic;</i>  <i>motion capture with preview in real time;</i>  <i>3D visualization;</i>  <i>final version in Unity (Scene view);</i>  <i>final version in Unity (Game view).</i> <br><br>  At this stage, the Unity graphics system and our additional shaders were subjected to increased loads.  As the Unity 5.0 engine underwent beta testing, we sent the Unity developers team our comments and suggestions regarding bugs, inconsistencies, integration issues and stability, and also asked for improved workflows and performance. <br>  At the last stage, we were engaged in iteration and final polishing of graphics and animation, correction of the remaining bugs in our tools and shaders, and finally, preparation for the delivery of the project. <br>  In the next article in this series, we will look at the creation of The Blacksmith video from a more technical point of view and will address the aspects of scene preparation, shading and lighting.  Stay tuned to the special page of our short film. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/263219/">https://habr.com/ru/post/263219/</a></p>
