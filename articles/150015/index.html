  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Geo-module for PHP applications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://www.webimax.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/shutterstock_74090383-2-300x201.jpg" align="left" alt="image">  The question ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù Arises immediately after the question ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù This pattern is also true in web development.  Many sites request information from the user, inviting him to enter his address, i.e., country, region, city, street, house zip code.  But how then to process this data, if they were specified in a free form?  In our first projects, we used our ‚Äúbicycle‚Äù, but as it grew and developed, this ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù turned into a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù, which put an end to the efficient processing of geo-information about our users.  I was given the task of nailing this monster, replacing it with a standardized geo-base and a simple interface for working with it.  Googling on this topic did not give a ready-made solution, so I had to drop the simple option and make my own geo-module. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Base addresses Russia </h4><br>  To begin with, it was necessary to find the base of addresses of Russia  In search of the address database, I came across two and it is quite possible that the only ones: <br><ol><li>  <b>KLADR</b> (RF Address Classifier) ‚Äã‚Äãis distributed in * .dbf format </li><li>  <b>FIAS</b> (Federal Information Address System).  By default, they will be distributed in the form of xml structure, but you still had to adjust to <b>KLADR</b> and, due to its archaism, FIAS also became distributed in dbf format </li></ol><br>  The difference between them is as follows: 400 MB <b>KLADR</b> versus 9 GB of <b>FIAS</b> ‚Äî a significant, isn't it?  For this, I definitely want to use <b>FIAS</b> , since it can be assumed in terms of volume that its data are more redundant, which is correspondingly better.  But I didn‚Äôt work with <b>FIAS</b> .  Requests on the address table were terribly long and neither the arrangement of the indexes nor the query optimization helped me, I also used MySQL 5.5 <br><br>  With <b>KLADR,</b> however, the work was formed, and as it turned out later, its details for my (standard) tasks are quite enough.  A review of the structure of the <b>KLADR</b> tables, but you can read <a title="Overview on the structure of KLADR tables" href="http://www.ksoft.ru/opis_kladr.htm">here</a> / For him, someone made an <a title="kladr api" href="http://www.magora.ru/info/kladr">api</a> that does not work :-), but maybe the guys will finish, I think many would be useful. <br><br>  In order to be able to use KLADR in the project, you need to convert it from the distributed dbf format into something understandable MySQL.  However, you can fill the database directly, for this you can use <a href="http://www.navicat.com/">navicat</a> or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mydbf2mysql/">mydbf2mysql</a> .

      Thus, I made a simple geo-module that can be screwed up for any needs. <br>  The project is available on <a title="Geo-module repository" href="">Github</a> . <br><br><h4>  What is a module? </h4><br>  The project was written using php 5.3, which is important. <br>  MySQL 5.5 DBMS, which is not very important. <br><br><h5>  Used libraries </h5><br><ul><li>  php Data Layer Doctrine 2 </li><li>  js jquery </li><li>  js jquery.form </li><li>  js jquery.autocomplete </li><li>  css 960cs </li></ul><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">File structure of the project</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre> .project # Project root

The available data on the location of the user is used to predict the location of the user, i.e.  three (region / district / city) drop-down lists, fill with data and select the desired location in them.  If the location is guessed correctly, then the user will only have to specify the street and the house, and the index (if it is in the clade) will be automatically substituted.  However, if at the ip address the location was not guessed, then the region / district / city can be changed.  For this was written piers js plug-in, which according to the selected region requests the district and large cities of the region, and according to the selected district, the city of the district. <br><br>  There is a yandex map to display the user's saved location.  However, you can make the map react on the fly to the choice of the location by the user. <br><br>  At the end of the page with the address setting form, for demonstration there is a block with the delivery calculation.  The delivery package itself is implemented as a ‚Äúdecorator‚Äù, so you can adjust the calculation of the amounts or the delivery time.  Actually, how the calculation works, it should be clear, you need to know from where and where, and then the matter of technology.  Delivery calculation can be expanded by adding a new * supplier *. <br><br>  It is fortunate that the structure of specifying FIAS addresses is similar to KLADR, please note that it is not identical, but therefore it‚Äôs similar if you refactor the \ Entities \ KadrRepository repository code a little, then FIAS can be used as a repository of addresses, the only question is whether this is necessary. <br><br>  I publish a detailed description of the API module in <a href="https://github.com/shotonoff/kladr_geo/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-api-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">WiKi on github</a> <br><br>  I hope that this module will be useful to someone, but I do not pretend to be the perfect solution, I will be glad to hear comments and suggestions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150015/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150015/</a></p>
