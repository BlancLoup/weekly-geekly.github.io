Instructions for beginners and life hacking</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sk/rq/dy/skrqdygvw25azzd8wy8jwikejtq.png"><br><br>  Prepared a guide for customers who are engaged in the publication of the application on their own.  We talk about pre-release troubles: how to create a developer account, how much time to lay on the design of the DUNS number, what screenshots to prepare for the store. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We must immediately warn: you can save a few weeks and your nerves, if you delegate the publication of the application to the developers.  Of course, under proper control.  They have more experience in release cases: they will do everything faster, they will correctly fill in all the fields and, most likely, they will not run into a redjack.  Do not forget to just change account passwords so that only you have data. <br><br><h2>  Preparing for publication </h2><br>  On average, the process takes a couple of weeks. 
      <br>

      <br>
      1. Create an Apple ID (10 minutes) <br>  2. We register a developer account (1 day as a developer \ 19 days as a company, DUNS number is to blame for everything.) <br>  3. We pay the account (2-3 days) <br>  4. Preparing marketing materials (1 day) <br><br><h3>  1. Create Apple ID </h3><br>  If you already have an Apple ID, go to step 2. If not, create. <br>  Go <a href="https://appleid.apple.com/">to the Apple site</a> .  Click the Create Your Apple ID button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sh/mt/mg/shmtmgp_uyvneosmzpekeky7gte.png"><br><br>  The form opens with personal data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xf/ha/-a/xfha-a-_gsp0h6luaxb7xowlnq0.png"><br><br>  Correctly fill in information about the account owner.  Below is an example of a profile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wn/w9/ud/wnw9udopc4vqitd88urbfqknemi.png"><br><br>  We answer three mandatory questions in case of loss of a password; without them, do not create an account.  It is better to write the data somewhere, so as not to forget the introductory information in a few years. <br><br>  A filled profile looks like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jx/ec/bi/jxecbisjqpag7ohqxqw6huqx3qs.png"><br><br>  We agree with the privacy policy, we solve the captcha and press the button "Continue".  A form appears in which you need to enter a confirmation code.  He will come to the mail associated with the account.  There are 30 minutes to enter the code.  Otherwise you have to start all over again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ic/jr/uc/icjrucpsftsnvj--1wvqvokq_te.png"><br><br>  Is done.  Apple ID is created. <br><br><h3>  2. We register a developer account </h3><br>  Go <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/">to the Apple site</a> .  Enter the Apple ID and password that we already have. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xp/fg/jz/xpfgjzlt5amlwj-bunzicdftbtg.png"><br><br>  We agree with the user agreement.  Click the Submit button.  We appear on the welcome screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gy/xj/sy/gyxjsym631uxriv67guixmxcjjy.png"><br><br>  Click Join the Apple Developer Program.  Go to the next screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p5/r-/de/p5r-defibvoghsnpbtfwg2lsrna.png"><br><br>  Our goal is the blue Enroll button in the upper right corner.  Push it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fu/r-/hc/fur-hcy4nmtjtmwgyoqecmaew4i.png"><br><br>  Now there are two ways: to join the program as an individual (individual) or as a legal entity (Company / Government Organization).  The cost is the same - $ 99, regardless of the type of developer.  The difference is the same - status.  In the column "seller" will appear either Ivan Ivanov, or Touch Instinct, LCC.  If the application has a piece of intellectual property, it is better to be safe and put on behalf of the company.  It will be easier to prepare an evidence base for Apple in the event of a dispute. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y0/lk/r4/y0lkr4npypltpzjtmkzb8fstenw.png"><br><br>  <b>As a developer</b> <br>  Select individual and click the button Continue. <br><br>  The next screen offers to fill in personal information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zm/eu/wf/zmeuwflrsknsil7xwoe7dufn_xy.png"><br><br>  We put a daw that agree with the terms of the user agreement.  Click the Continue button. <br><br>  <b>As a company</b> <br>  If you want to register as a company, you are waiting for similar fields and a bit of hell.  To get Apple tested, you need to get the organization's DUNS number. <br><br>  Duns can be <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/touchinstinct/blog/342046/">obtained free of charge on the official website</a> or <a href="https://www.dnb.ru/login/%3Fnext%3D%252Forder%252Fadd%252F%26message_info%3Dorder_add">bought for 12,240 rubles</a> .  The latter is a punishment for those who do not know English.  14 days after receiving the number information will be from Apple.  Leave at least 19 business days on hold.  Please note that the name of your company on Apple and D &amp; B should be exactly the same. <br><br><h3>  3. We pay the account </h3><br>  Got to pay!  Click the Purchase button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b_/ma/da/b_madatq8wrbev7k-xzxhdjbtbq.png"><br><br>  Fill in the information about the payer.  Standard online shopping, nothing out of the ordinary.  We had a slight hitch at this stage.  The cardholder's last name was different from the account holder's last name ‚Äî Apple got anxious.  The support service asked to send a scan of the passport of the account owner to confirm the identity.  It took four more working days.  The money was immediately debited from the card, but the payment took another two days. <br><br>  The final touch in history is a confirmation email that comes in the mail.  As soon as the order came, you can upload the application. <br><br><h3>  4. Preparing marketing materials </h3><br>  Prepare materials in advance so as not to lose time during the release. <br><br>  1. <b>Application name</b> <br>  Will be displayed in the App Store.
