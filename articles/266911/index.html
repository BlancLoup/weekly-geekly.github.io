I am 28 years old and I am a novice system administrator. <br><br>  I first encountered the amazing world of computers in 2004.  being a schoolboy. <br>  Few people had a computer at home in those days, and I remember having saved up a few rubles, my friends and I rushed to an Internet cafe, where on ancient computers, through IEv5, it seems, they enthusiastically comprehended the art of internet surfing, looking at more experienced ones the regulars. <br><br>  When I entered the humanitarian university, it somehow happened that I started communicating with local administrators more than with fellow students, I reinstalled Windows XP for the first time, pressed the cord for the first time, heard terms like hub, switch for the first time ...

      I was unreal like to help users in a computer class, I felt its importance when I did what others could not do.  Reinstall the system, for example or Outlook configure.  I knew the IP addresses of various university servers by heart. <br><br>  In general, it is quite logical that having gained the experience of ‚Äúenikey‚Äù I very much wanted to become a system administrator, so in 2009, in absentia, I entered a technical college. <br><br>  Well, in general, I finished the preamble. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now about why the topic has such words as a system administrator, and the actual crisis. <br><br>  Recently I watched seminar <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/266379/">‚Äú36‚Äù by</a> <a href="https://habr.com/users/makishvili/" class="user_link">makishvili</a> , from Yandex.  With the exception of age and profession, all that was said in it was said about me.  And I think I'm not alone.  I want to overcome this crisis extremely strongly, and I don‚Äôt know how to do it.  My last job is a government organization.  I work in it for the third year. <br><br>  During this time I received three upgrades, now I‚Äôm steering the IT department, but in fact I am still the same system administrator I came to here.  Only now I learned that to be called and to be are different things.  Raised the domain, set up backups, the printer even stopped falling annoyingly cursing the print service.  And then, silence.  From time to time I clean computers, and I replace mice with long-legged users.  Yet so it works.  But I want so much more.  From melancholy began to fill cartridges.  But I'm an admin, not a service engineer or a tanker, I love my profession and I really want to continue to grow in it. <br><br>  I recently read a course on CCNA, in the way a good interesting and classic book is being read, I got unreal pleasure, but I cannot apply the knowledge gained anywhere.  I have a feeling that there is not a single active network equipment in my country at all, let alone ciskovsky.  When I consider vacancies in other countries, I do not meet the requirements.  There is a huge gap between these requirements and the junior. <br><br>  Guys, I sometimes read your articles, I look at profiles where the age is indicated significantly less than mine, and I am amazed at you. <br><br>  Tell me, please, how can I, junior, bridge this abyss.  I am not a programmer and not a designer, I do not want to be a service engineer either.  I am a system administrator, and I really want to develop in this direction. <br><br>  Please do not judge strictly, this is my first "first attempt at writing." <br><br>  On Habr√© for a long time, but I am sure that comments on this article will be useful not only for me, but also for a large number of other users.  Maybe someone has already overcome a similar crisis - please share your experience of further development. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/266911/">https://habr.com/ru/post/266911/</a></p>
