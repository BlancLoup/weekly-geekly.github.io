If we are talking about the implementation of a project to automate paid parking, such an error can cost from several million to several tens of millions of rubles. <br><br>  From 11 years of design, installation, and maintenance of security systems, we have made an important thought: to buy a technically complex system is difficult and scary, especially if you do not know how. <br><br>  Especially in order to make the right choice, we compared 19 manufacturers of equipment for automated paid parking systems.

      In this article we will try to tell all that we know about the choice of the manufacturer of equipment for the automation of paid parking, this article is big, because the matter is serious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/940/c74/070/940c740707df428aaaf355c906ba2c2c.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <b>What for?</b> </h2><br>  <b>Saving money</b> <br>  The introduction of automated parking in many cases allows you to completely get rid of the costs for operators who do not manually control parking on the non-automated parking. <br><br>  <b>Competitive advantage</b> <br>  Having the opportunity to park freely in the immediate vicinity of the purpose of the trip becomes a significant advantage.  Especially at a time of year when the climate does not have to walk, and in Moscow it is seven months. <br><br>  <b>Parking efficiency</b> <br>  Irrational use of parking space.  Not automated parking is filled by taxi drivers, office clerks from nearby business centers, residents of nearby houses, etc.  This greatly hinders the filling of the parking lot with targeted visitors. <br><br>  <b>Control</b> <br>  Unscrupulous personnel (banal theft).  According to various data on paid, but not automated parking lots, with the participation of operators in the payment process, the owners of parking lots do not receive up to 35% of revenue. <br><br>  <b>Security</b> <br>  In crisis conditions, the number of crimes traditionally increases.  An important task with which the system will help you is to prevent theft of vehicles. <br><br><h2>  <b>What are modern parking automation systems?</b> </h2><br>  In the Russian practice, under automated parking systems, it is customary to consider software and hardware systems that automate the processes of entry / exit into the fenced territory of the parking space with charging. <br><br><h3>  <b>The main elements of paid parking systems</b> </h3><br>  Entry racks - <a href="http://securityrussia.com/parking/vezdnye-stoyki/">price from 175 600 rubles</a> <br>  Exit racks - the <a href="http://securityrussia.com/parking/vyezdnye-stoyki/">price is from 173 600 rubles</a> <br>  Automatic barriers - <a href="http://securityrussia.com/avtomaticheskie-shlagbaumy/">price from 41 195 rubles</a> <br>  Automatic cash desks (parking machines) - <a href="http://securityrussia.com/parking/kassy-avtomaticheskie/">price from 260 220 rubles</a> <br>  Software - <a href="http://securityrussia.com/parking/soft-parking/">price from 7 500 rubles</a> <br>  Identifiers (cards, tickets, etc.) - <a href="http://securityrussia.com/skud/id/">price from 16 rubles</a> <br><br><h3>  <b>Degree of automation</b> </h3><br>  The choice of payment method determines the degree of automation of the parking system.  Allocate partial and complete. <br><br>  Partial automation involves the use of manual cash desks and involves the operator in the payment process, while the full will require automatic cash desks / terminals. <br><br>  Automated systems with any work requiring monotony, care, honesty will cope much better than people.  As a result, it is also cheaper.  Naturally, initial investment in a full automation system is always more expensive. <br><br>  In conditions of a limited budget, it is possible to introduce an automated paid parking system in stages, at the first stage using operators to receive funds, and at the second stage, install automatic cash desks. <br><br><h3>  <b>Identification methods</b> </h3><br>  As an identifier for automated parking systems can be used: <br><br><ul><li>  Barcode paper tickets </li><li>  Contactless RFID Plastic Cards </li><li>  Plastic Tokens </li><li>  Car numbers </li></ul><br>  As a rule, parking equipment works with barcode tickets or contactless RFID cards.  Both options have their pros and cons. <br>  Let's look at them in more detail: <br><br>  <b>Contactless cards</b> <br>  Ideal for objects with low traffic intensity, such as business centers, hotels, small shopping and entertainment centers. <br><br>  Pros: <br><br><ul><li>  Look presentable, nice to hold in your hand. </li><li>  Allow to put a bright branded advertising facility </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><br><ul><li>  Low informative value for the visitor (the time of arrival to the parking is not visible, you need to keep information in your head) </li><li>  Of particular importance is the maintenance of equipment (cleaning rollers in the racks entry / exit) </li><li>  Regularly removing cards from the exit racks and reloading them into the entry racks </li><li>  Cleaning the cards themselves, being in the hands of the visitors, they become soiled why they stick together </li></ul><br>  <b>Barcode Tickets</b> <br>  Suitable for objects with high traffic intensity, such as stadiums, train stations, airports.  On the Russian market there are two types of tickets: on the check tape and thermal card. <br><br>  Pros: <br><br><ul><li>  Informative for the visitor, the ticket has all the necessary information about tariffs discounts, time of arrival </li><li>  There is no need to maintain the thermal printer often (50,000 tickets for the first maintenance) </li><li>  Do not often need to re-lay the card in the rack, one roll of check tape is enough for 7000 entries / exits </li><li>  Low cost check tape, about 500 rubles per roll </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><br><ul><li>  Ticket is easy to damage, wet or stain, making it difficult to read on the road </li><li>  Not presentable appearance (especially tickets on the check tape) </li></ul><br>  <b>Tokens</b> <br>  This type of identifiers is quite rare lately.  Mainly used for single visitors.  The small size of the tokens themselves makes it possible to use containers of 2,000 pieces, which simplifies and makes more rare the process of repacking the entry racks. <br><br>  Most often used in combination with contactless plastic cards, where tokens are issued to one-time visitors, and the cards are used by regular guests. <br><br>  Pros: <br><br><ul><li>  Low system installation costs, due to the lack of need to lay a cable </li><li>  Simple transfer and processing of information using the Mifare contactless tag </li><li>  Capacity of the bunker for tokens is enough for 2000 entries (in the cards, for example, only 500) </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><br><ul><li>  Small size, easy to lose. </li><li>  Not presentable appearance </li></ul><br>  <b>Car numbers</b> <br>  Systems with recognition of state.  Car numbers are quite convenient and partly simplify the hardware of the system, may not be effective enough due to the difficulty of recognizing dirty or damaged numbers. <br><br>  The most rational use as auxiliary identification in order to protect against fraud. <br><br>  Pros: <br><br><ul><li>  The ability to determine the exact time of entry when you lose your ticket </li><li>  Ability to create "white", "gray" and "black" lists of visitors </li><li>  The ability to store and intelligently search information in the database by several parameters (recognized number, date, time of travel, camera number) </li><li>  Automatic comparison of the license plate of each car leaving the parking lot with the number that was recorded at the entrance. </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><br><ul><li>  Difficulty in reading dirty license plates </li><li>  Difficulties with recognition in conditions of limited light </li><li>  Damaged license plates </li></ul><br>  <i>Comparison of identification methods by manufacturers</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/687/895/1b1/6878951b194442169a938eb39932a807.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  <b>Billing and discounts</b> </h3><br>  Flexible pricing allows you to maximize parking revenue while minimizing customer inconvenience. <br><br>  <b>Basic billing features</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Establish the dependence of the cost of parking on its duration </li><li>  Set different cost of parking for different times of the day, for example, your parking can very successfully work in the mode of paid night parking for residents of nearby houses </li><li>  Set separate tariffs for guest, debit and subscription cards </li><li>  Set discounts for debit card holders </li><li>  Create complex ("nested" rates for example - the first three hours are free, after 50p / hour) </li><li>  Create zones with different billing </li></ul><br>  <i>Comparison of pricing capabilities by manufacturers</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0k/z4/td/0kz4tdwf8hnjv9jy592m6tdn9ak.png"><br><br><h3>  <b>Payment methods</b> </h3><br>  Depending on the specifics of the object and the degree of automation chosen, the possibility of payment is realized in the systems both at the automatic cash desk and at the operator. <br><br>  Payment is made in various ways: <br><br><ul><li>  Bills </li><li>  Coins </li><li>  Bank cards (including with PayPass) </li><li>  By SMS </li></ul><br>  <i>Comparison of payment methods by manufacturers</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac3/f81/852/ac3f818523ae455fa38c38ee6a5b5c01.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  <b>Additional features</b> </h3><br>  The use of a paid parking system should be convenient for both visitors and staff, ensuring its uninterrupted operation.  To this end, manufacturers of automated parking systems realize the following features: <br><br><ul><li>  Counting the number of empty seats </li><li>  Voice communication with the dispatcher at the entrance / exit </li><li>  Voice communication with the dispatcher at the automatic checkout </li><li>  Various information service functions </li></ul><br>  <i>Comparison of additional features</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c3b/501/58d/c3b50158d34547b0bb05da840913d892.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  <b>Integration with video surveillance</b> </h3><br>  Manufacturers of automated parking systems produce special software modules for integration with video surveillance systems, which allow: <br><br><ul><li>  Recognize and fix car numbers.  Create black and white lists of visitors </li><li>  To fix the image of the car at the entrance and exit.  The operator has the ability to compare images and, if necessary, to prohibit exit </li></ul><br>  <i>Comparison of video surveillance integration capabilities</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da5/412/6b1/da54126b141040d580e7b28fd654aebf.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  <b>System cost</b> </h2><br>  To give you a rough understanding of the cost of systems, depending on the manufacturer, we roughly calculated the cost of one fully automated entry point and one exit, and sorted them in ascending order. <br><br>  <b>Russian manufacturers:</b> <br><br>  <font color="#fa6b00">Quasar</font> - 109 083 rubles. <br>  <font color="#fa6b00">Plant CAM</font> - 815 350 rub. <br>  <font color="#fa6b00">EcoPark</font> - 816 000 rub. <br>  <font color="#fa6b00">Ertel</font> - 1 408 750.000 rub. <br>  <font color="#fa6b00">Grand Parking</font> - 1 149 800 rub. <br>  <font color="#fa6b00">PKF Stella</font> - 1 411 750.000 rubles. <br>  <font color="#fa6b00">Project</font> - 1 496 880 rubles. <br>  <font color="#fa6b00">Stump</font> - 1 644 500 rub. <br>  <font color="#fa6b00">Park City</font> - 1 878 862 rub. <br>  <font color="#fa6b00">Parktime</font> - 1 962 972 rub. <br>  <font color="#fa6b00">ASCT</font> - 1 968 416 rub. <br>  <font color="#fa6b00">RPS (RPS)</font> - 1 975 794 rub. <br>  <font color="#fa6b00">Up Technology (Vector AP)</font> - 2 002 215 rubles. <br>  <font color="#fa6b00">AAM Automatic</font> - 2 103 205 rub. <br>  <font color="#fa6b00">Shtrih-M</font> - 2 623 030 rub. <br>  <font color="#fa6b00">Transaction</font> - 2 280 093 rub. <br><br>  <b>Foreign manufacturers:</b> <br><br>  <font color="#fa6b00">Designa</font> - 3 708 922 rubles <br>  <font color="#fa6b00">Came (PS ONE)</font> - 4 110 327 rubles <br>  <font color="#fa6b00">Scheidt &amp; bachmann</font> - 4 528 640 rubles <br>  <font color="#fa6b00">Skidata</font> - 4 569 998 rubles <br><br>  In more detail with the standard estimates for the automation of parking, you can find on <a href="http://securityrussia.com/resheniya/platnaya-parkovka/">our page with typical solutions</a> . <br><br><h3>  <b>Instead of conclusion</b> </h3><br>  Choosing a vendor for an automated paid parking system, remember that the system should work for you not for a year or two, but it means that the manufacturer must be confidently standing up and able to provide spare parts, technical support and equipment upgrades. <br><br>  The second important point is integration, the parking automation system is part of the security system, and therefore its integration with video surveillance systems, access control, security and fire systems is important.  The efficiency of its use and maintenance depends on this. <br><br>  If you have already begun to think about the implementation of a paid parking system, our <a href="http://securityrussia.com/parking/">home page on packaging equipment is</a> at your service.
