The Embedded World exhibition, held in Nuremberg (Germany) from February 23 to 25, as well as one of the biggest events of the year in the world of high technologies, MWC 2016 in Barcelona this time presented many interesting surprises.  Last week we <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/icover/blog/271664/">talked</a> about the announcement of the processor module SF-BT1 from the domestic company ‚ÄúT-platforms‚Äù.  Another interesting event related to the name of this rather young, but promising team was the announcement of the Tavolga Terminal TP-T22BT monoblock, also based on the Baikal-T1 processor.  We invite you to share your opinion on the presented novelty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/243/668/8a7/2436688a74e60336e3ed6803d3ae7d48.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúTavolga Terminal‚Äù is the first computer based on the ‚ÄúBaikal-T1‚Äù processor, designed to create automated workstations.  The proposed solution is an ideal ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù between the IT infrastructure and end users, representing the sector of the federal bodies of the Russian Federation, state institutions and the corporate sector, focused on the use of secure domestic solutions.  ‚ÄúWe are very pleased that we managed to realize the potential of the Baikal-T1 processors to create functional and safe workplaces,‚Äù said Vsevolod Opanasenko, General Director of T-Platforms OJSC.  ‚ÄúOur pilot projects have demonstrated a high level of interest in this solution, and we hope that the system will become very popular.‚Äù <br><br>  In accordance with the information provided by the manufacturer, a monoblock computer ‚ÄúTavolga Terminal‚Äù, depending on the configuration, can be used as an energy efficient workstation running Linux Debian 8 OS or as a web client providing remote access to applications using remote desktop protocols, such as VNC or RDP or via a web browser.

      The system provides the ability to connect to a standard Gigabit Enternet network implemented using 1000BASE-T technology or to a fiber-optic network.  Support for virtualization at the processor level and two Gigabit Ethernet ports allow you to work with several operating systems isolated from each other and to simultaneously connect to two independent local networks.  Thanks to this principle of organization, an opportunity is created to reliably protect the internal network from external Internet attacks. <br><br>  The configuration of the processor ‚ÄúBaikal T1‚Äù includes a hardware encryption accelerator made in accordance with the requirements of GOST 28147-89 (Magma, the Soviet and Russian standard describing the way that the same cryptographic key is used for encryption and decryption) and compatible with certified hardware and software encryption.  According to information provided by the T-Platform, domestic developers are already creating several means of information protection to work as part of the Tavolga Terminal AWP. <br><br>  So, the company ‚ÄúCRYPTO-PRO‚Äù creates an adapted crypto-provider CryptoPro Pro CSP for Tavolgi, which, in particular, can be used when authorizing electronic signatures.  The company InfoTeKS is working to create a specialized solution based on the ViPNet protected networks designer, which allows ensuring the security of the PKI and VPN services.  In the process of adaptation, cryptographic USB tokens ‚ÄúRutoken EDS‚Äù and ‚ÄúRutoken S‚Äù ensure contactless two-factor authentication in a computer system and reliable storage of key information. <br><br>  The company also notes that the product uses domestic processors "... a whole new circuit design - a completely new motherboard was developed for the SF-BT1 processor module, a whole range of mechanical components was changed for the board configuration, the cooling system was radically revised." <br><br>  The main characteristics of AWP "Tavolga Terminal TP-T22BT" <br><br>  * Display 21.5 "(54.6 cm), IPS, 16: 9, Full HD 1920 √ó 1080, LED backlight <br>  * Processor - "Baikal-T1" (MIPS P5600, 2 cores) <br>  * Graphics adapter - SM750, 16 MB of video memory <br>  * Memory - from 2 to 8 GB DDR3 <br><br>  Local storage <br><br>  * 8 GB NAND Flash (optional) <br>  * 8 GB Disk-on-Chip SSD (optional) <br>  * 2.5 ‚ÄùSATA SSD (optional) <br><br>  Sound <br><br>  * PCM2912A codec <br>  * Built-in stereo speakers 2 √ó 2.5 W <br><br>  External connectors <br><br>  * 4 √ó USB 2.0 <br>  * 1 √ó PS / 2 <br>  * Device for working with smart cards <br>  * Device for working with SD / SDHC / SDXC / MMC / MS memory cards <br>  * 3.5mm single input for stereo headset (TRRS CTIA / AHJ) <br>  * Kensington lock slot <br><br>  Networking opportunities <br><br>  * 2 √ó 100/1000 Mbit / s Ethernet RJ-45 (8P8C) <br><br>  or <br><br>  * 1 √ó 100/1000 Mbit / s Ethernet RJ-45 (8P8C) <br>  * 1 √ó port for SFP module (100/1000 Mbit / s) <br>  * OS Support - Linux distributions based on Debian <br><br>  Key Benefits <br><br>  * The processor of a domestic manufacturer allows the use of an automated workplace in structures with increased requirements for information security, which was taken into account at the device design stage. <br>  * Availability of built-in module for working with smart cards <br>  * It is a ready software and hardware complex with a set of client-server software from leading Russian developers <br>  * Complete with passive cooling system with low noise. <br>  * High energy efficiency. <br><br>  One of the important advantages of the proposed configuration - compatibility with existing national standards: <br><br>  * GOST R IEC 60950-1-2009 - ‚ÄúInformation technology equipment.  Safety requirements.  Part 1. General requirements " <br>  * GOST R 51318.22-99 - ‚ÄúElectromagnetic compatibility of technical equipment.

Requirements and test methods <br>  * GOST R 51317.3.2-2006 - ‚ÄúElectromagnetic compatibility of technical equipment.  The emission of harmonic components of the current by technical means with a current consumption of not more than 16 A (in one phase).  Standards and test methods " <br>  * GOST R 51317.3.3-2008 - ‚ÄúElectromagnetic compatibility of technical equipment.  Limitation of voltage changes, voltage fluctuations and flicker in general low-voltage power supply systems.  Technical means with a consumed current of not more than 16 A (in one phase), connected to the electrical network if certain connection conditions are not observed.  Standards and test methods " <br>  * SanPiN 2.2.2 / 2.4 1340-03 - "Hygienic requirements for personal electronic computers and work organization" <br><br>  The choice in favor of the monoblock form factor will, on the one hand, save on the purchase of a separate monitor, on the other, to find additional free space on the desktop.  Alternatively, in the near future, the company will offer a compact desktop device without a built-in screen. <br><br>  You can order a new product now.  The start of large-scale deliveries is scheduled for the second quarter of 2016.  The first batch will be about a thousand units.  ‚ÄúNow we are working on contracts for significant volumes of supplies,‚Äù the company informs.  - Many of our first customers expected a product announcement from 2015.  Until such time as contracts are not signed, we cannot name our customers. ‚Äù  Processor modules for mass parties "Tavolgi", as well as motherboards will be made only in Russia.  The complex of mechanical components - in the countries of Southeast Asia.  The final assembly will be organized at Russian enterprises. <br><br>  In Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãat the Mobile World Congress 2016 on the Tavolgi boards, the Prpl foundation stand was successfully worked out, where a prototype of the prplSecurity protected environment was demonstrated. <br><br>  At the same time, the cost of PCs on ‚ÄúBaikal-T1‚Äù processors, as noted in the ‚ÄúT-platform,‚Äù differs from the alternative offers based on Intel processors in a smaller direction.  Recall that the line of Tavolga monoblocks from the T-platform was first <a href="http://www.t-platforms.ru/about-company/press-releases/556-tavolga.html">announced</a> in March 2015 and was presented by two modifications based on fifth-generation Intel Core processors with a Broadwell microarchitecture.  Prices, respectively, were about $ 1,100 (at the rate on the day of payment) with an Intel Core i3-5010U processor and about $ 1,200 with an Intel Core i5-5287U processor. <br><br>  It is assumed that for small batches the estimated price of the Tavolga Terminal TP-T22BT computer complex will be 69,000 rubles per set.  The cost of the device when ordering large quantities will be discussed separately. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.t-platforms.ru/">T-platforms</a> <br><br><hr><br>  Dear readers, we are always happy to meet and wait for you on the pages of our blog.
