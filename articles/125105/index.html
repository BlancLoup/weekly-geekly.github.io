  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fry it! Or reanimation of the video card in the oven</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About half a year ago, my GeForce 8800GTS 512 ordered to live long, starting to issue artifacts.  After some time, the "windows" stopped loading.  In Bios, however, remained artifacts and incomprehensible characters instead of letters. <br><br>  And so it happened, I dug up the old woman and decided to breathe a second life into it.  Having read experiments on similar resuscitation, I armed myself with a head, hands, and a multimeter with a thermocouple. <br><br>  So, briefly the theory - why do we need an oven.  The fact is that such signs of video card dying indicate that some contacts of the chip begin to ‚Äúfall off‚Äù and give microcrack between the contact and solder.  Therefore, if you bring the solder to the melting state (200-230 degrees Celsius), it can ‚Äúpick up‚Äù the contact back and resume conductivity and consequently ‚Äúrevive‚Äù the video card.  You can heat the required section, or the entire video card can be in different ways.  I chose the most "classic" - the usual gas oven, although people are also experimenting with building hair dryers and even microwaves with a grill. <br>  Let's start! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Stage 1 - preparation. </h5><br>  <u>We will need:</u> <br><ul><li>  Thermal paste </li><li>  Thermocouple Multimeter </li><li>  Gas stove with oven </li><li>  Thermal pads (optional, in order to replace the staff after warming up, but you can leave the old ones) </li><li>  Foil </li></ul><br>  The first thing we start with is to carefully remove the cooler and all the plastic parts.  Next, clear the video card from all kinds of stickers and other things.  We erase the remnants of the old thermal paste and thermal pads with alcohol.

    <img src="http://www.tumblr.com/photo/1280/8041866614/1/tumblr_low6cblxvL1qml5rx" alt="image"><br><br>  Speaking of capacitors, in my case they are solid-state and are not afraid of rising temperatures.  If you have liquid-based capacitors, they need to be evaporated during the procedure.  Especially desperate "fry" and "liquid", but they begin to flow, because  Boil from the heat, so do it at your own peril and risk, and if you decide to - plenty of them wrapped in foil. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/37e/171/372/37e1713720942a0e0a0285ec03846cbf.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Liquid based capacitors. <br><br>  Then you should cover with foil all parts that are not desirable to fry, namely - connectors for connecting the monitor, PCI and SLI connectors, as well as capacitors.  The foil should be applied with the glossy side of the video card, because it reflects heat better, it is also necessary that the foil covers the places that will support the video card in the oven.  For this, I chose a glass shallow pan. <br><br><img src="http://www.tumblr.com/photo/1280/8041866614/4/tumblr_low6cblxvL1qml5rx" alt="image"><br>  Here's what I got. <br><br><h5>  Stage 2 - ‚ÄúFrying!‚Äù </h5><br>  So proceed! <br><br>  We already know that we need to raise the temperature to 200-230 degrees.  But there is one more parameter - time.  Ideally, we should hold the temperature of 200-230 degrees in the region of 5 minutes, but!  It is necessary to reach this temperature slowly - because  drops are very destructive and not desirable for a crystal.  In my case, the oven I was not "super" and "accelerated" for a very long time.  In total, I spent about half an hour, but basically 15-20 minutes is enough. <br><br>  <u>As it was with me:</u> <br>  10th minute - about 100 degrees <br>  20th minute - about 150 degrees <br>  25th minute - about 200 degrees <br>  30th minute - about 220 degrees <br><br>  <u>But it is possible and so:</u> <br>  5th minute - 150 degrees <br>  10th minute - 200 degrees <br>  15th minute - up to 230 degrees <br><br><h5>  Stage 3 - Extract </h5><br>  Everything, our "pie" is ready, and it may already smell very well - so ventilate the room.  But do not try to immediately pull it out!  You must first let it stand inside and cool down, after 15-20 minutes you can open the oven door by 45 degrees, after another 20 minutes you can open it to full capacity and after another 20 minutes remove it! <br><br><h5>  Stage 4 - Build </h5><br>  "Dress" back our card and pray.  As I already said, thermal pads can be bought new, old ones can be used, but this is not the best option, and you can make your own from medical bandage and thermal paste. <br><br>  So my card started up, there were no artifacts, and for more than a month now it has been serving me faithfully.  Cases of repetition of artifacts are not rare, but you already know what to do?  True? <br><br>  <b>PS</b> The author is not responsible for unsuccessful experiments, I just told the technology, and it‚Äôs up to you to risk it or not.  Moreover, video cards die not only from the ‚Äúbad solder‚Äù. <br>  <b>PPS</b> I used a multimeter with a thermocouple to measure, although there is a ‚Äúmeter‚Äù of temperature on my gas stove, but it turned out that its deviations from a wound with a multimeter are almost 50 degrees, so I strongly recommend using a multimeter. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125105/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125105/</a></p>
