  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Online Patenting at the United States Patent and Trademark Office</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is possible.  Maybe for someone this is not news, but for me it has become almost a discovery: you can patent your invention in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, in abbreviated form - USPTO (that's where all Google and Patent are patented ) without getting up from the computer.  In the literal sense of the word.  My whole procedure took exactly 15 minutes.  I hasten to share. <br><br>  Information for consideration: <br><br>  1. The USPTO is the American Rospatent, with only brains. <br>  2. The USPTO accepts applications for patenting from residents of any countries, including from the Russian Federation. <br>  3. They have such a wonderful thing as a temporary application (Provisional Application) - this is a priority for an invention in a simplified and accelerated form.  A kind of announcement of your future patent. <br>  4. Provisional Application (hereinafter Provisional Application) is valid for 12 months, after which it needs to be confirmed by ‚Äúthis patent‚Äù, otherwise it expires. <br>  5. Temporary application is not published anywhere. <br>  6. The application may be written in Russian (but the translation must be submitted no later than 16 months from the date of submission). <br>  7. The application costs from 105 dollars.  It is possible and more, but it depends only on the amount of information that you try to stuff into the application.  105 was enough for me. <br>  8. Registration of the application is done using the EFS-Web web application.  It can: add an application to the USPTO database, check this application, accept a fee for accepting an application and send an application receipt receipt to the applicant. <br>  9. I am not a patent attorney, not a lawyer and in general no-no-no.  Just an amateur.  Therefore, if you decide to get a patent this way - check.  Although I, like, everything turned out. <br>  10. The Provisional Application clearance service for patent attorneys costs an average of 15,000 rubles.  Not counting the duties themselves.

      So let's go <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I filed just such a temporary application, and I‚Äôll tell you about it, but first of all, a few links that may be useful <br><br>  EFS-Web <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/ebc/efs_faq.htm">FAQ www.uspto.gov/ebc/efs_faq.htm</a> <br><br>  Useful tools (PDF editors, document requirements, presentations describing the EFS-Web system) <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/ebc/portal/tools.htm">www.uspto.gov/ebc/portal/tools.htm</a> <br><br>  Sandbox.  Imitation of a real form to fill out.  You can practice before the present - the data is not sent anywhere.  Here are the lessons (tutorials).  <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/ebc/portal/sandbox/efs0-3-0.htm">www.uspto.gov/ebc/portal/sandbox/efs0-3-0.htm</a> <br><br>  <b>Starting from here <a href="https://sportal.uspto.gov/secure/portal/efs-unregistered">sportal.uspto.gov/secure/portal/efs-unregistered</a> (Unregistered eFilers tab)</b> <br><br>  First, personal data.  Fill only what is under the asterisks.  Next, select New application, Utility, Provisional, Continue.  Go to the tab "Application Data" - the main data. <br>  Here the title of the invention (Title of Invention) is no more than 500 characters.  Again the name.  Correspondence Address - fill.  Go to the tab "Attach Documents" (Applications). <br>  Here it is necessary in more detail.  Applications to the application may be different.  As far as I understand with my non-patent mind, the main thing is the description of the invention.  There may be drawings, detailed patent formulas and much more.  The curious direct road to Google Patent - there are examples - weight.  All these extras.  materials to the main application and there are applications.  I had ‚Äúabstract‚Äù and ‚Äúdrawings-only black and white line drawings‚Äù - a brief description and a black and white diagram, respectively.  Do all this in PDF.  They do not exclude txt files there, but they are somehow reluctant, so I did it in pdf.  Here <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/ebc/portal/tools.htm">www.uspto.gov/ebc/portal/tools.htm</a> you can find links to programs for creating pdf.  So, continue. <br>  Tab "Attach Documents" (Applications). <br>  We attach our applications (the fee will depend on their quantity), we select the corresponding Category and Document Description on the right.  Click Upload &amp; Validate.  He checks.  If everything is correct, they will show you a blue diamond, if not, they will write what the error is.  Continue. <br>  Calculate Fees Here the main thing in the ‚ÄúCurrent Business Size‚Äù column is to choose a ‚Äúsmall entity‚Äù (small business or individual) - the amount of payment will be less.  Tick ‚Äã‚Äãin "Provisional".  Opposite ‚ÄúAmount‚Äù is the amount you need to pay.  Continue. <br>  Confirm and Submit.  Here we check everything: Personal data, description, applications, amount to be paid.  If something goes wrong, we roll back the tabs to the required level and rule.  Submit. <br>  Here the phrase begins with "The USPTO has received your ...".  That is, they accepted the application.  But in order to receive a much-needed receipt (‚ÄúAcknowledgment Receipt‚Äù), proving that the application was actually accepted, we have to pay.  Therefore, press "YES!  I want to pay now. ‚Äù <br>  Pay Fees.  I paid with a credit card Visa - Select method of payment - Charge Credit Card.  And "Start online payment process". <br>  Well, actually, that's all.  Here we fill everything under the asterisks.  I paid immediately.  After that, a page with this very receipt is opened (‚ÄúAcknowledgment Receipt‚Äù).  It once again says everything: who is the inventor, what is inventing, the number is assigned to the document, which applications, etc. <br><br>  The last thing I would like to say is that in the same place, as I understand it, you can also design patents and trademarks.  Also online.  But he did not check.  Good luck. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37698/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37698/</a></p>
