  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Experience "file processing" D-Link DI-624s</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the spring of this year, I decided to buy a Wi-fi router for myself, so that I would be in order not to cling to my girl‚Äôs laptop on a separate card via a rope.  He climbed the pocket, climbed the store site, compared the desired with the possible and bought himself a D-Link DIR 300, a little neat, works well, does not ask for a drink.  As they say, set up and forget :) <br>  But here, in the same spring, my brother calls me and says, saying, would you like to change the routers for a while?  His connection on L2TP was somehow unstable and the router was hanging.  Well, since at that time I had a provider who had a binding for Mac and I didn‚Äôt need any L2TP, I agreed.  Moreover, his model D-Link DI-624s has on board two USB2.0 and print server <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It took 2-3 weeks and I safely moved to another provider that works on PPPOE.  Everything was good, nothing predicted trouble, until I climbed into p2p.  Search was not looking for anything, the topic was not studied very much, it got into the settings.  He forwarded ports, searching rustled, put the most popular movie and climbed to surf, the declared speed without limit to 100 Mbps, had to cope with the film in 5 minutes.  But it was not there ... after half a minute the websites stopped loading, nothing was pinged, the router was hanging!  After a minute, the router came to life, after a minute it hung, after a minute ... well, you understood ... When downloading from a p2p file with more than 5 users, the router hung.  Here's a pancake, changed the awl to soap, I thought, but somehow I spat and forgot.  I didn‚Äôt sit in p2p often, and even then other concerns appeared, in general, was forgotten ... <br><br>  A month later I remembered that I was tired of waiting for something while the movie was being downloaded slowly and sadly from a maximum of five users.  I loaded this ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù in the backpack in the morning and took it to work.  At work, people have a lot of versions.  It was lazy to experiment, so they began to check all reasonable ones, or rather to try solutions :-) There were two reasonable ideas, overheating and fig capacitors in the power supply unit.  Started with a block.  Since smart Chinese made the unit not collapsible, I had to get a drill (Packard Spence PSEG 170 engraver) and half the body.  Having sniffed at the burnt plastic - removed the insides.  Sharp-eyed colleagues at work saw the bad entrance Conder, which were easily discharged and replaced by other, more sane same, but different company.  Then the question of overheating arose. <br>  I disassembled, looked, let the infinite ping and four cars go to the router, and the chip began to warm up.

Fan 40 by 40 was not at hand, but there was a small radiator from the dead continent and the same drill, with which it divided the radiator into 4 parts, just under the size of a chip 14 by 14, not very carefully, but oh well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/247/7c4/6b4/2477c46b4481a28404433de5e11c2755.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A protector ruler without a lid with attached temperature sensors.  The working temperature of the horse was 54-55 degrees.  I put on download, with more than 20 connections, several large films with p2p, for the whole time of downloading only one blade, while the temperature jumped to 58-59 degrees.  I took some AlSil-5 hot melt glue and stuck a radiator.  The temperature on the surface of the radiator (not an exact measurement, but still) was 53-54 degrees at full load. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c32/857/95e/c3285795ed5e9576ea738e9865d50ee2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The funny thing is, I then gave this D-link to a friend, and bought myself an ASUS WL-500gP Premium over which I also had to poshamanit and reflash with alternative <a href="http://wl500g.info/forumdisplay.php%3Fs%3D6928b6538d4593f5931172a6da8b420b%26f%3D86">firmware from Oleg</a> :) <br>  The ruter has been working for a friend for 5 months already, there are no problems, it is constantly loaded, there are no freezes <br><br>  <strong>UPD:</strong> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wl500g/">continuation of the case of Oleg</a> firmware update </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78289/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78289/</a></p>
