"Client part" - I said, - "the server does not <br>  will affect, and therefore, you can score.

If you do not understand what is written here, please do not minus. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started with the use of the library <br>  EXT JS on our project, but <br>  specifically the <a href="http://extjs.com/deploy/ext-1.0.1/examples/grid/edit-grid.html">EditableGrid</a> widget.  Originally <br>  I really liked the library.  First of all, its object-oriented <br>  structure.  Problems began later.  Looking ahead I will say that I am still <br>  I remain a fan of EXTJS.  Another library that would be the same <br>  logical and offered such opportunities I do not know.

      You can read some common js problems <a href="http://sunnybear.habrahabr.ru/blog/23315.html">here.</a> <br><br><br><br><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a> <u>- <b>Cascading</b></u> <b><u>Style</u></b> <b><u>Sheets</u></b> <u>- ‚Äúwhat's the word for</u> <u><br></u>  <u>cascading? ‚Äù</u> <br><br><br><br>  In fact, this problem was pointed out to me by our <br>  html coder (Zhenya, hello! <br>  J) <br><br>  Take a look at the css file, <br>  which is used. <br><br>  Yes, sometimes styles are specified cascade, but in <br>  overwhelmingly - NO.  ‚ÄúWhat is the problem?‚Äù You ask.  For me, <br>  as for a java programmer, the problems are not <br>  existed until I implemented the grid on the open page.  AND‚Ä¶ <br>  I have all the styles floated.  Grid looked awful.  What's the matter?  The fact is that on <br>  page used common css styles for everything <br>  of the project and they had a higher priority than the styles that are described in <br>  grid.css.  Why <br>  so - I will not explain to you.  I understand this as ‚Äúthe more accurate the path, the higher <br>  style‚Äôs priority ‚Äù, at least such an explanation works for me.  there is <br>  another modifier "! important", but as I was told, it is better not <br>  abuse.  I hope, considering the number of professional designers <br>  here in the comments will be an explanation. <br><br>  So, for myself, I concluded - use the word <br>  "Cascading" in the definition of CSS. <br><br><br><br>  <u>Update CSS</u> <u>rules or first brakes</u> <br><br><br><br>  It turned out that according to the requirements in one of the grids you need <br>  It was display 20 columns.  ‚ÄúSmall number‚Äù - as I thought.  It turned out that <br>  not. <br><br>  Ext.grid.GridView uses a fun mechanism to specify the width of the columns.  When drawing <br>  creates a &lt;style&gt; node in which <br>  empty view styles are written: <br><br><br><br>  # [grid ID] <br>  .x-grid-col- [number <br>  columns] { <br><br>  2} <br><br><br><br>  For example: <br><br><br><br>  # grid-example .x-grid-col-0 { <br><br>  2} <br><br><br><br><br><br>  When the html code is ready, <br>  these dynamically generated styles are modified and indicated <br>  width of each column.  For each such style is performed <br><br><br><br>  Ext.util.CSS.updateRule <br><br><br><br>  I must say that this is not a cheap operation.  And for 20 <br>  speakers observed significant brakes.  Thus had to optimize <br>  this mechanism to remove the tangible pause that occurred since <br>  downloads, until the moment when the user could really do something. <br>  In addition, the processor load was 100%. <br><br>  I initially generated not empty styles, but immediately <br>  created filled with set widths <br>  (width).  Rolled, but then it had to <br>  clean up (see below). <br><br>  So, for myself, I concluded - do not use <br>  dynamic update of CSS tables. <br><br><br><br>  <u>A large number of elements or "well, how much can</u> <u><br></u>  <u>shove?"</u> <br><br><br><br>  You will see approximately this code for each cell in <br>  gridou: <br><br><br><br>  &lt;td class = "x-grid-x-grid-td-1 <br>  x-grid-cell-5-1 "tabindex =" 0 "&gt; <br><br>  &lt;div class = "x-grid-col-1 <br>  x-grid-cell-inner "&gt; <br><br>  &lt;div class = "x-grid-cell-text" unselectable = "on"&gt; $ 31.61 &lt;/ div&gt; <br><br>  &lt;/ div&gt; <br><br>  &lt;/ td&gt; <br><br><br><br>  This is just ONE cell.  It turns out that except <br>  td, the hapless browser will need to keep more <br>  at least two DOM objects.  It takes memory <br>  and resources. <br><br>  In my opinion, this should be avoided. <br><br><br><br>  <u>Working with a DOM</u> <u>table or "well, that's dead"</u> <br><br>  It should be noted that in the forums, developers honestly <br>  warn that working with a large number of lines will slow down and <br>  should use pagination.  But ... users are always right and <br>  did not want to see the pages.  In fact, there is a simple way <br>  optimize the grid to work with quite a large number of rows (I have <br>  Works with 500 no brakes). <br><br><br><br>  What was the problem?  The fact is that <br>  GridView uses table view. <br>  Delete / insert / edit operations were very slow, if <br>  the number of lines was more than 20 (with the number of columns more than 15).  It and <br>  clearly, the table is not just an array, but the whole object that is needed <br>  recount / redraw.  In addition, when all values ‚Äã‚Äãchange in any <br>  column (for example, a calculated column that depends on an external parameter) <br>  the browser just died and never came to itself. <br><br><br><br>  How was this decided?  From the profile I realized that working with <br>  large tables (&gt; 20-30 rows) takes an order of magnitude longer than <br>  with small (&lt;20 lines).  After that, I looked at the implementation <br>  Google Spreadsheet.  Here is <br>  what I found there: they don't use one big table, but break into <br>  many small, which are located one under one.  In addition, the width <br>  columns are not specified by styles, but, more logically, through the width of the first row <br>  using style <br>  table-layout: <br>  fixed <br><br><br><br>  <u>Result</u> <br><br>  Thus, GridView has been rewritten with the following rules: <br><br>  - Use CASCADE styles <br><br>  - Do not add extra items in <br>  Dom <br><br>  - Do not use dynamic style update <br><br>  - Split large tables into several <br>  little ones <br><br>  As a result, I received <br>  EditableGrid that can work with large <br>  number of lines. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13304/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13304/</a></p>
