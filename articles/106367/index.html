      The impact of legislative changes on Bynet became a subject of discussion in the section ‚ÄúThe Legal Field of Bynet.  What's new? ‚ÄùAt the‚Äú Business Internet ‚Äùconference.  Representatives of the Operational Analytical Center under the President (OAC), the Ministry of Communications and Information, the Reliable Programs company (TUT.by portal) and the Internet provider Alternative Digital Network (brands of Atlant Telecom and Shparki Damavik) took part in the discussion. "). <br><br>  Questions about the possibility of legislative regulation were raised on the Business Internet two or three years ago.  But, as Igor Sukach, director of Alternative Digital Network, deputy chairman of the association ‚ÄúBelinfokom,‚Äù notes, no one could have imagined that this was possible.  At that time, only laws on electronic document, on electronic signature, and on banking law and related rights were in force in Belarus. <br><br>  <b>How did decree No. 60 affect the life of Bynet?</b> <br><br>  Decree No. 60 of February 1, 2010 on Measures to Improve the Use of the National Segment of the Internet, entered into force several months ago.  And it is already possible to observe and evaluate how he changes the ‚Äúrules of the game‚Äù established in Bynet. <br><br>  According to Igor Sukach, opinions about this document were immediately ambiguous in the association ‚ÄúBelinfokom‚Äù.  But the authors of the document in the development of bylaws took into account the comments of experts and the Internet community and found a compromise solution.  As a result, the implementation of the norms of the law in practice went quite smoothly. <br><br>  When discussing Decree No. 60, the legislature demonstrated a willingness to engage in dialogue and listen to the online community.  And this is noted by many experts. <br><br>  The number of positive changes to which Decree No. 50 led, Yury Zisser, CEO of TUT.by, includes the beginning of the elimination of Beltelecom‚Äôs monopoly, a focus on reducing Internet access tariffs, the emergence of copyright issues on the agenda, and the removal of responsibility sites for the statements of users. <br><br>  But also minuses, according to Yury Zisser, the document has enough.  Among them, Zisser considers discrepancies and vague wording, belated official comments, ambiguous bylaws.  Decree number 60 introduced the mandatory registration of users on subscriber devices, Internet resources and electronic stores.  Internet cafe can now be accessed only by ID.  The government agencies and institutions introduced mandatory filtering of the Internet.  These changes, according to the expert, should also be attributed to the number of negative ones. <br><br>  <b>How will decree No. 515 affect the life of Bynet?</b> <br><br>  Presidential Decree No. 515 ‚ÄúOn some measures for the development of a data network in the Republic of Belarus‚Äù was signed on September 30, 2010.  The document initiates the reform of the unified information network of Belarus. <br><br>  Innovation involves: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ creation of a single republican data transmission network (ERSPD) <br>  ‚Ä¢ creation of a National Traffic Exchange Center (NCET) <br>  ‚Ä¢ the appointment of a single independent regulator - OAC - which will develop the procedure and rules for interaction between market players. <br><br>  Networks of government bodies, local executive bodies and state organizations will be mandatory included in ERSPD.  Also, all new or reconstructed networks will automatically be included in ERSPD.  Already existing networks owned by private companies may be included in the ERSPD on a voluntary basis.  It is assumed that the creation of a unified infrastructure for all providers will lead to greater competition at the level of services and tariff plans. <br><br>  At the moment, even the officials themselves cannot give unambiguous interpretations of the concepts contained in the decree and explain the mechanism of action in practice.  In this situation, talking about the consequences of innovations is difficult.  Pavel Petrulevich, Deputy Head of the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications and Informatization, considers innovations to be the starting point for further development.  OAC employee Sergey Kravtsov also believes that the settlement of legal relations will give impetus to a more active development of the Internet. <br><br>  And representatives of telecommunications companies, at the moment, it seems, just want to understand how the rules of the decree will be implemented.  There are a lot more questions at the moment than answers.  Igor Sukach, representing one of the largest Internet providers in Belarus with 10 years of experience in the market and an association of information and communication technology organizations, suggested that the legislature should involve Belinfoc more closely at the stage of preparing documents, and not after their adoption. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/106367/">https://habr.com/ru/post/106367/</a></p>
