Iron guard, he froze in the doorway, scanning the room with the rays of his laser sensors.  It was already the second day that we had to retreat, and now the robots completely pinned our guys against the wall.  The last frontier is left - this is the room.  The usual room in the panel of sixteen. <br><br>  The iron body gleamed in the rays of the setting sun.  Dead, inhuman gaze sought out the surviving fighters of the elite Resistance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a99/eed/157/a99eed1570f425a259808cff1b7905ef.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      What will happen when he finds them?  Crush his steel tentacles, suck to the last drop of life, eat alive, take prisoner?  I didn't want to think about it. <br><br>  ‚ÄúQuiet,‚Äù whispered Leopard.  Huddling to the wall itself, lying on the floor, the men watched in silence as the almost invisible rays slashed in front of their noses.  - Laser volumetric scanner, - he added, - I heard about such. <br>  ‚ÄúI saw their drone yesterday,‚Äù Snow replied.  - flew straight here, searched the entire apartment.  And once even chased after me when I was hiding.  Hardly disappeared from his electric eyes.  Well, they are terrible!  - he made a pause.  - We must run.  What if he's not alone?  Suddenly, he will transfer the data about us to others, and now there will be a whole company of similar mechanical killers? <br><br>  ‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù Leopard agreed.  - We must get rid of him.  Here now our guys on help!  It was rumored that one of our fighters had mastered ways to immobilize these creatures, he added. <br><br>  Snow suddenly thought of his mother.  He remembered how tenderly she looked into his eyes, calling by name.  Much time has passed since he saw her last.  Where is she now that with her?  ‚ÄúMom, I have enough of you now,‚Äù he thought.  Did the iron creatures get to her?  What if caught? <br><br>  - Otherwise, do not leave.  We must immobilize him.  But how do we do it, Leopard? <br>  - I do not know.  We have no weapons.  Yes, and his armor does not break through.  And what if you try to press down something heavy?  In addition, they work on electricity, but it is the same everywhere. <br>  - Yes, but surely.  I saw them at some point stick to the outlet.  Take energy from there for yourself.  Leopard, this could be a weak spot! <br>  Leopard squinted thoughtfully. <br>  ‚ÄúYou know, we could have a trap ...‚Äù <br>  - Let's lay out what you came up with there, - Snow enthused. <br>  ‚ÄúIf only luck is on our side, and they cannot fight in the water.‚Äù <br><br>  After discussing a cunning plan to combat the machines, the men headed to the place where the trap was installed.  But they failed to pass unnoticed. <br>  - He must be distracted, Leopard.  He chases, as it always happens.  And I lightning will jump out of our shelter and activate the trap.  Just don't let him grab you! <br><br>  There was no time to think, and Leopard readily accepted the fate of the bait.  He ducked and crawled to the other wall, soon finding himself at the opposite end of the room.  As the fighters expected, the robot rushed in his direction. <br>  - Bars, on top!  - I heard the cry of Snow, when a drone flew into the door‚Äôs doorway. <br>  Settled in ambush, Snow activated the trap, knocking over a vat of water on the ground hellish machine.  The mechanism stopped, and sparks fell from it.  Short circuit interrupted the movement of a metal beast. <br><br>  The drone went down to the ground.  It seemed he was in a hurry to help his companion who had been trapped.  The guys took advantage of the moment and at once fearlessly rushed to the flying machine from their shelters.  Their weight pinned the drone to the floor.  The fighters managed to turn it over and press the blades down.  The flying machine was no longer able to return to its original position. <br>  - Haha!  Happened!  - cried Bars. <br><br>  - He is dead?  - Snow put a foot on the robot, as the winners do, and began to look at it closer. <br>  - I do not know.  Snow, don't do it, don't touch it.  It is better to leave quickly.  We tear claws! <br><br>  - My quadrocopter!  - in the doorway, through which a hostile flying object leaked a couple of minutes ago, a boy of ten appeared.  He held a remote control in his hand and looked at half the room flooded with water.  An inverted quadrocopter lay close to a soaked wet vacuum cleaner with a dimmed display.  At the last, there was a dent from a vase with water and flowers that had fallen from a shelf and a shattered shattered piece. <br><br>  The field of battle was littered with yellow tulips, either in tribute to the enemy, or in celebration of the victory over him. <br>  Two furry tails of Snowball and Barsika disappeared from prying eyes in the next room under the sofa.  In today's battle, the resistance elite fighters defeated their rivals, but only God knows how many more dangerous clashes and risky fights they will have! <br><br>  <i>Written in collaboration with Q.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398387/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398387/</a></p>
