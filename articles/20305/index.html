  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 reasons why illegal downloaders will not be blocked in the UK</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now there is a lot of chatter about the <a href="http://newsru.com/cinema/12feb2008/pirat.html">story</a> of The London Times called ‚ÄúInternet users will be blocked during illegal downloads‚Äù, which also appeared on the BBC website under the more disturbing title ‚ÄúIllegal loaders will meet with blocking in Britain‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The newspaper says "people who illegally download movies and music will be disconnected from the Internet on the basis of a new legislative proposal that appeared last week."  In fact, this is all nonsense.  The fact is that the successful dissemination of this ‚Äúspicy‚Äù offer reflects in all its glory how illiterate the ‚Äúpowerful people‚Äù are with regard to downloading information. <br><br>  Let's put everything in its place <br>  1. This proposal was a draft for the Green Book, negotiated as ‚Äúa proposal without a requirement for implementation‚Äù. The government receives many such papers every day.  This is something like spam.  Prime Minister's toilet paper is much more important than most of the green proposals, both of which are usually filled in the same place. <br><br>  2. This proposal is completely and completely incompetent in the real world.  Internet providers will not commit <br>  for the content of the sent packets (and should not), besides it is impossible to open and check every single download or download for legality without crushing the entire Internet into dust.  This is not in the best interests of the government, Internet service providers or voters.  Blocking consumers and exposing themselves to billions without fail is not the best business strategy.

      3. It is impossible to tell the difference between illegal downloads and legal activities such as downloading patches, using VoIP or torrent's to distribute legal things, downloading pictures and many other things.  The confrontation of the private sector will be as strong as the ordinary public one. <br><br>  4. The whole idea goes against the ruling of the European court, which claims that EU members are not obliged to provide private information about suspected violators.  This also goes against Article 10 of the European Legislative Expression of Freedom, which gives every European a ‚Äúfreedom to hold opinions, receive and transmit information and ideas without interference by public authority or state borders‚Äù <br><br>  5. WiFi transmission and encoding of packets makes it impossible to establish the identity that downloads data to the end point.  All this complicates things even more, while the majority of content producers retain their general silence. <br><br>  Finally: <br>  <em>Insert the sound of merging water here.</em> <br><br>  This idea is like trying to prevent people from singing 'Happy Birthday' to each other over the phone or burning libraries to protect the print industry.  What scares these ideas is that they stir up discussions among the government and industry workers, who even have no idea how the Internet works, or that laws providing for democracy can be changed. <br><br>  Before the discussion continues, music and film companies must finally prove the illegality of downloads estimated at millions of dollars in losses.  CD sales are falling because no one uses them anymore, Hollywood is rude with respect to pirates.  There should be no more talk of changing laws or spending money paid by consumers to solve this ‚Äúproblem‚Äù until someone proves its reality. <br><br>  In addition, if this is really a problem, consumers do not have to pay.  The entertainment industry must stop the government from dripping on the brain to protect inefficient business models and look for a solution that they have already met for 10 years. <br><br>  via <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/illegal-downloaders-will-not-face-uk-ban-080212/">torrentfreak</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20305/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20305/</a></p>
