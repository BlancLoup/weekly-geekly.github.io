But can search engines <b>take into account all the actions of all users on all sites</b> on the Internet?  Of course not. <br><br><br>  <b>Many optimizers</b> identify the following factors that are taken into account when ranking sites: <ul><li>  Bounce rate </li><li>  User's time on site </li><li>  Browse pages </li><li>  Clicks on the proposed links </li><li>  CTR pages in search results on request </li></ul><br>  <b>They say about it:</b> <ul><li>  <a href="http://www.webeffector.ru/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%258B">webeffector</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://seopult.ru/subscribe.html%3Fid%3D22">Seopult</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.seonews.ru/analytics/detail/125322.php">Seonews</a> </li><li>  Other... </li></ul><br>  <b>Optimizers</b> also <b>claim</b> that data sources are: <ul><li>  Analytical systems (Yandex metrics, Google analytics, etc.) </li><li>  Yandex Bar </li><li>  Search results </li><li>  LiveInternet et al </li></ul><br><br>  But here is an elementary <u><b>example</b></u> : <br>  <b>Take 2 sites of the same subject.</b>

    <h3>  First site </h3><br>  <b>Installed</b> : Yandex Metric, Google analytics, LiveInternet, Yandex webmaster, Google web master. <br>  We have the following <b>characteristics:</b> <br><ul><li>  Attendance of 1000 people per day <br></li><li>  Average time on site 4 minutes <br></li><li>  Failures 25% <br></li><li>  Viewed 6 pages (on average) <br></li><li>  Everyone is actively clicking on links. <br></li></ul><br><br><h3>  Second site </h3><br>  <b>Established</b> : nothing <br>  We have the following <b>characteristics</b> : <br><ul><li>  Attendance: ??? <br></li><li>  Average time on site: ??? <br></li><li>  Waivers: ????? <br></li><li>  Watched: ???  pages <br></li><li>  Who where clicks on the site - we do not know <br></li></ul><br><br>  Now let's imagine that we are Yandex programmers and write an algorithm for ranking sites.  What should we do? <br>  The only option is to analyze many similar sites and display average values.  Substitute them in the second site and compare.  But there is one huge question, <b>is this fair?</b> <br>  It is perfectly clear to everyone that there is nothing honest here.  The characteristics of the second site may be much better, but the weight of behavioral factors will be much lower. <br><br><br>  But let's see <b>what we can really compare:</b> <br><ul><li>  <s><b>Attendance</b></s> Clicks from search engines (you can display the CTR of the site and understand how often your site is chosen for a specific request).  For example, if your site is the seventh in search results, but it is clicked on much more often than the first one, it seems that it is more suitable for a certain search query. <br></li><li>  <s><b>Time spent on the site The</b></s> time between clicking on your site (in search results) and on your competitor's site.  Suppose your site is in 3 positions and the user clicked on it.  After that 7 minutes passed, and the user clicked on another site (in the same search result).  Thus, we understand that the user spent about 7 minutes on your site (although maybe he made tea for himself). <br></li><li>  <s><b>Refusals</b></s> If a user clicks on your site (in search results), and after 3 seconds clicks on the next one, then it is perfectly clear to everyone that the user did not like your site.  But there are situations when users click on several sites, and only then watch them, it means: <b>mint &lt;X &lt;maxt.</b> <br>  <b>Mint</b> - the time allotted to the user, so that he would have time to open several sites. <br>  <b>Maxt</b> - the time allotted to the user, so that he would have time to look at the information on the site and this was not considered a ‚Äúfailure‚Äù. <br>  Most likely, in each field of activity this time is different (it is generally difficult to say something about the issue of ‚Äúrefusals‚Äù).  In the metric, they are counted <a href="">like this</a> (but this is Metric ...) <br></li><li>  The last click in the search results will tell the search engine that the user has found what he was looking for.  That will also affect extremely positively. </li></ul><br><br><hr><br><h2>  We feel the difference </h2><br>  A very interesting way has appeared on the Internet to see the influence of behavioral factors on your site.  It is necessary to type a query with "bilybirda" in a search engine. <br><br>  <u><b>For example:</b></u> <br><ul><li>  <b>Key request</b> (regular search results) <br></li><li>  <b>Key request dshfhjsdgfhsgdfhsgdfhsgfhvjxchvjkghas</b> (search <b>results</b> that do not take into account behavioral factors) <br></li></ul><br><br>  And even there was a special <a href="http://www.seolib.ru/controls/positions/factors/">service</a> . <br>  Let's check how correct this information is. <br><br><br>  Take the query <b>"wedding photographer"</b> and the site <b>weddingphoto.spb.ru</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f4/c25/cdc/9f4c25cdcd7801b8d344f7512dc285ab.jpg"><br>  <b>Seolib</b> shows that: <ul><li>  Normal issue 7th place </li><li>  Without behavioral factors 8 place </li></ul><br>  Let's try using the <b>‚Äúmanual method‚Äù</b> and compare the results: <br><ul><li>  wedding photographer (site is on the 7th position) </li><li>  wedding photographer ‚Äìdfklshfwtfdsgfs (site is on the 8th position) </li><li>  wedding photographer ‚Äìdfkvjhjkdsskdhfvcxvsadasdvcxvsdfsdfgfdghdgh (the site is in 9th position) </li><li>  wedding photographer -fcvx-fd3sdfa-345 (the site is on the 9 position) </li><li>  wedding photographer ‚Äìfvcxvsdaf (site is on the 7th position) </li><li>  wedding photographer ‚Äìfvcxvskjnkdghdfgmbncvbvxcvasdbnvngnvndfgdfg (site is on the 11 position) </li></ul><br>  <i>Conclusion: I would not trust this method (on other requests I, of course, also tried to do all this).</i>  <i>Even without knowing the weight of behavioral factors, I still actively develop them on all my portals.</i> <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Improving behavioral factors </h2><br>  Behavioral factors can be improved by different methods, but <b>there is a basis of the basics:</b> <br>  <i>It is important that the user receives the information for which he came.</i>  <i>If he wanted to buy firewood - he should see firewood, characteristics and a huge ‚Äúbuy‚Äù button in front of him.</i> <br><br><h3>  Video content </h3>  Watching a short video is a great opportunity to lie back in a chair and stretch.  Especially if the video on the topic.  Try to post videos no more than 3-5 minutes. <br><br><h3>  Interesting custom design </h3>  If the design of your site is made professionally and interestingly, as well as dynamic elements are present, then it is quite likely that the user will ‚Äústick‚Äù on your site.  Such portals, as a rule, have practically no failures, and this is already an advantage over competitors. <br>  Examples of "enticing design": <ul><li>  <a href="http://events.techdays.ru/html5camp/2013-03/">one</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://aic.ru/">two</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://jiouhe.com/">three</a> </li><li>  and many other sites ... </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Placement of the game </h3>  It often happens that a small game delays the client, and he cannot tear himself away from her for about 15-30 minutes, and sometimes he plays for hours.  Especially if the passage of this game will be meaningful, for example, the user of the past game will receive a 5% discount. <br><br><h3>  Related products </h3>  Any online store must contain a module "related products" or "buy with this product," because: <ul><li>  It is possible that the customer came for one product, and leaves with five </li><li>  Accompanied by internal linking </li><li>  Customers linger longer on the site </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Usability and interesting texts </h3>  Do not forget that if the user is not comfortable using your site - he will leave.  If you have banal huge and uninteresting seo-texts, the user will also leave. Try to pay great attention to the convenience of the site, this is important not only for promotion ... <br><br><h3>  Online manager </h3>  Do not forget that the user may have questions about the products or the functionality of the portal.  Try to diversify the ways in which he can ask you a question.  One of the modern ways is to correspond with the company's manager online (as a chat).  While there will be a correspondence, the user will be on the site, which will also give importance to behavioral factors, in addition, any client will thank you. <br><br><h3>  Social button +1 from google </h3>  Don't forget about the <a href="http://www.google.com/%2B1/button/">+1</a> button <a href="http://www.google.com/%2B1/button/">from Google</a> <br><br><h3>  Favicon </h3>  Do not be lazy to order beautiful favicon.ico for your site.  Do not forget that it is displayed in Yandex search results. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  General conclusion </h2><br>  Improving behavioral factors will result in: <ul><li>  Improving site position </li><li>  The convenience of the site will increase </li><li>  Increase the information content of the site </li><li>  It is much likely that the number of orders will increase. </li></ul><br>  <i>You need to pay great attention to your site, because</i>  <i>The site is a very powerful tool for selling your products / services or providing useful information to users, and improving behavioral factors contributes to the development of your portal.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172211/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172211/</a></p>
