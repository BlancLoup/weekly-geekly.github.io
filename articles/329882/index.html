Why don't you take his place?  You have a lot of experience, you know the command like the back of your hand, you master C ++, C # masterfully, Java and what can I say - you are a programmer from God! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/531/f41/952/531f41952838489fb310e40239c3bdfd.jpg"><br><br>  Only now the management does not notice that "you are here for the whole team, dragging around" and pull out projects a week before the deadline.  In short, it's time for you to lead!  You sleep and see how cool everything goes with you, productivity increases, tenders one by one, the universal recognition of the team and the authorities are yours.  That's just the increase left to get.  And now to the point.  What all the same prevents such a steep specialist as you take everything out of the swamp and rule the world? <a name="habracut"></a>

      For example: <br><br><ul><li>  Do you think flexible methodologies for wimps </li><li>  Think Timlide is only in charge </li><li>  Think that the team leader only checks for all the code </li><li>  Think it's just a cool dude. </li><li>  You think too much </li></ul><br>  You have to be a leader, because any leader leads a team, causes trust, friendliness, and in general he is a cool guy.  But now is not about that.  We are not talking about the usual leader or head of the advertising department.  We're talking about the leader of a team of strong developers who still troll Lena from the HR department for what she called HTML programming language (ha ha ha).  Hmm, so here.  Look at the 9 reasons that prevent you from becoming a team leader: <br><br>  <b>1. You can not quickly make decisions</b> <br><br>  And this is not your fault.  Well, not quite.  You just do not have enough experience to quickly make the right, optimal, balanced decision.  According <a href="https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/hubfs/content/2017_Global_Developer_Hiring_Landscape.pdf%3Ft%3D1490979180195%26utm_source%3Dvk%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dstack-overflow-proveli-bolshoe-issledova">to the Stack Overflow study</a> , 48.3% of developers recognize their work as a hobby.  And if you choose the software architecture, programming language and offer an alternative to the customer is much harder than to decide which car to steal in the GTA - think about it, do you need it?  Because the work that does not bring pleasure = doom yourself to the endless cycle of hell.  Ta-dam! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e87/f19/2f9/e87f192f99424850b8cb66d771c1bb2c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>2. You can‚Äôt say no</b> <br><br>  Yes, you are just a kind guy who is always happy to help (even if this is not at all a joy to you).  You scored a lot of work, and even finish everything for everyone.  No, you will definitely become not a leader, but a person who allows you to sit on your neck, but also help you to climb.  You should be able to say no.  Timlid, who spends the night at work and completes everything for everyone - a strange leader.  Let's add a little logic and understand that if a team does not deliver the modules on time, then the manager is far from a pro.  Well, can not the whole team be Krivoruk? <br><br>  <b>3. The organizer of you is not very</b> <br><br>  Perhaps you have a huge amount of ideas and an endless stream of creativity.  It is understandable (sometimes you have to invent such crutches)!  Only here on the embodiment of ideas into reality, it takes you, in the literal sense, an infinite amount of time.  You offer and do nothing.  ‚ÄúYou need to implement Agile‚Äù - you said, and for six months now you continue to work on a cascade model.  ‚ÄúLet's run down the internal stack with source codes!‚Äù - well, you understand ... Put ideas into life and you will be noticed.  Initiative workers are generally appreciated, and developers are even more so. <br><br>  <b>4. You are passive</b> <br><br>  Going to a bar in the evening - ‚Äúnooo‚Äù, go on a business trip - ‚Äúnooo‚Äù, blog and share life hacks - ‚Äúzacheeeem?‚Äù, Gash with a useful piece with colleagues - ‚ÄúI have nothing to do?‚Äù.  All this matters too.  1, 88 are points in which HR evaluates your input to open source applications.  Doing something for the soul or ‚Äúfor fun‚Äù, you show that you really enjoy working.  Such employees are valued because they are ready to bring more benefits to the company than employees who work hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/33f/d09/d4f/33fd09d4fe074daabdf9e1688064eef3.jpg"><br><br>  <b>5. You often make mistakes</b> <br><br>  Maybe not in the code.  You have forgotten that today there was a planning meeting and were late.  You forgot to move the sticker on the scrum-board, forgot about the deadline, forgot, forgot, forgot ... These are also errors that influence the opinions of others about you. <br><br>  <b>6. You think that communication skills and communication skills are only needed by the sales manager.</b> <br><br>  Sociability is the main skill noted by HR specialists in the Stack Overflow study.  Imagine your team taking on a huge project.  You broke the product into 10 modules, and each developer took himself to work on the module and wrote the code without interacting with the others.  Now everyone writes in different languages, there are no single variables, all works in different stages seem like a bad dream.  Sociability is needed for productive and high-quality team work.  If the whole development department consists of couch potatoes and introverts - nothing good will come of it.  Timlid communication is needed to interact with the team, management and customers.  Clarification of requirements, conflict resolution (yes, you will postpone the dates and begin), communication with users and drafting user scripts.  Now you will talk more than code: ( <br><br>  <b>7. You think you can do everything yourself.</b> <br><br>  Need to be able to share.  And even work.  If you do not delegate working powers - die or just burn in the workplace!  Such a team leader is not needed neither by the team, nor by the management.  You do not have to be dead in the middle of a project.  To think about yourself, in part, to think about your team, which hopes for your help and participation.  Therefore, share the work and distribute small tasks to other participants.  Tasks for the trainee type "Bring coffee" - not at all.  Ask a colleague to gather the rest of the participants for the planning meeting or ask each of them to write the desired tasks (and it‚Äôs convenient for you to draw up a schedule and do well for them). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/33d/b89/a26/33db89a2688b40419aead12ecf98980c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>8. Learn the basics of management for your humiliation.</b> <br><br>  In university years, together with classmates, you laughed at the guys from the Faculty of Economics - ‚ÄúHmm, the poor will face the fate of a free cash register.‚Äù  And now you had to learn the basics of management, calculations in Excel, project planning and other ‚Äúenterprise shame‚Äù!  Do not torture yourself.  If this item is about you - hammer and forget - you will become an excellent tech-lead.  Because the team-lead always bears the burden of paperwork, communication with the customer and, no matter how regrettable it may sound, management. <br><br>  <b>9. You just don't tell anyone.</b> <br><br>  You talk about your desire to colleagues or leadership.  The 21st century is the century of technology, but for some reason, telepathy is not in trend.  This is primarily for you.  If you really want to try on the role of team leader - forward to leadership.  Tell us about your desire: what you want to bring, what to change, remove, and why you should lead the team.  And you can take and send a response to the <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/company/megafon/job/biznespartnyor_na_proekty_v_bigdata_ailegfdx/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr">job lead team</a> in a cool company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ae2/d02/b0a/ae2d02b0ace14499972136ef34c1f194.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329882/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329882/</a></p>
