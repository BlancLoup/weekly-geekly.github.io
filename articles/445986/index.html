  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Customer Development as a life philosophy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is a Friday article about the use of modern business methods in everyday life.  Please take with humor. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Customer Development came to us as a technique for determining the needs of potential customers when creating new products.  However, its principles can be applied in solving many personal problems.  Moreover, CustDev can be part of the life philosophy of modern man. <br><br>  Applying the Cust Dev philosophy helps to improve relationships between people.  As a life principle, it may look like this: <br><blockquote>  If you want to get a good result and a grateful attitude towards yourself, then first find out what people want and do it, and not what seems right for you personally. </blockquote>  The algorithm for applying this principle is simple. <br><br><ol><li>  Try to prepare and conduct research in advance. </li><li>  Remember the statements and actions of people for whom you are going to do something on a given topic. </li><li>  Think over clarifying questions. </li><li>  Ask clarifying questions in advance and gradually, without attracting attention. </li><li>  If you want to conduct research covertly and without arousing suspicion, then organically weave in your questions during other conversations and discussions. </li><li>  Avoid public opinion polls, because in public people often do not express their opinions, but tend to other people's authoritative opinions. </li></ol><br>  How can I apply.  Examples 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

      Example No. 1: Buying a gift to a loved one or colleague. <br><br>  We all face the problem from time to time - what to give to close people in the conditions of a huge variety of options.  We want the gift to be personal, memorable, soulful.  In other words - the way the donee wants. <br><br>  Get ready in advance - pay attention to what the donee looks at in stores, which he often talks about, the discussion of which items are of great interest. <br><br>  The Customer Development technique is effective when applied to research past experience.  If the topic of gifts ever emerges in your communication, it is worth asking - what gift did you like / remember most in life?  And why? <br><br>  Ask your friends in general what the person who needs to buy a surprise gift is interested in. <br>  If you think to ask directly - what to give to you, then you risk hearing accusations of inattention or even greed.  Therefore, it is better to still explore the topic covertly. <br><cut></cut><br>  Example number 2: Office improvement. <br><br>  Quite often in the HR-environment there is a theme of office improvement - what else can this be done to make it easier for your beloved employees to work.  With the help of Customer Development philosophy, the task is solved quite simply. <br><br>  Listen to what relaxation formats the staff are discussing over a cup of tea or coffee. <br>  What inspires your employees?  Do they discuss the interiors of offices of famous companies?  Drop them into the chat photos of the offices of well-known companies and listen to what they will say in connection with this. <br><br>  You can directly ask the question - ‚ÄúWhat would you personally improve in our office and how?‚Äù.  You need to ask face to face.  You can organize a survey on Google-forms, but it must be anonymous, and the request to pass it must be expressed personally to each employee.  This is important, because suspicious employees can immediately suspect that something is wrong, think that they are thus appreciated, that reductions may soon happen or that someone will be deprived of bonuses. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445986/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445986/</a></p>
