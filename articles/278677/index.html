Yes, you were not mistaken and read correctly, namely the routers.  Life does not stand still, and AudioCodes has long been a pioneer of VoIP and the world-famous brand of voice gateways of any scale, from one FXS port to several STM-1, turned into a manufacturer of complex and integrated solutions not only for the operator, but also for the corporate market .  Now the company‚Äôs product profile has more solutions that are not in the voice gateway category than traditional gateways. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>What is AudioCode Business Router?</b> <br>  After a visual inspection of the interfaces, many will say that this is a typical and familiar Mediant 500, Mediant 800 or Mediant 1000 gateway. However, let's take a closer look at all the series of devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5cd/f03/832/5cdf03832f0a4682bef091db320bfcc7.jpg"><br>  Not all models of these series have analog or digital TDM interfaces.  So, no longer a gateway.  Although this statement does not mean that there is no VoIP support on devices without TDM interfaces.  But first things first.  AudioCodes Routers are the Mediant 500 / 500L MSBR, the Mediant 800 MSBR, and the Mediant 1000 MSBR.  Each name is a series of devices with different configurations, which are distinguished by the presence and number of specific WAN / LAN interfaces and / or TDM interfaces.

      The abbreviation MSBR (Multi Service Business Router) is added to the name of conventional gateways, which means that this type of devices is primarily intended as a router.  In terms of software (firmware), Mediant and Mediant MSBR are different.  However, replacing the Mediant MSBR firmware can turn into a regular voice gateway or SBC, about which we wrote earlier <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/audiocodes/blog/270739/">here</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/audiocodes/blog/269969/">here</a> . <br><br>  As a router, models with TDM ports simultaneously additionally receive voice gateway functionality (from several FXS to 1-2 E1 streams).  Models with LAN ports (up to 12 on the Mediant 800 MSBR) are simultaneously a LAN switch, and when using the SBC license, the device also receives SBC functionality.  There are models with built-in WiFi access point.  This is not enough, there are models with built-in OSN modules, which are an Intel server.  And this feature can be used to install any operating systems and third-party applications or IP-PBX, implementing all-in-one boxed (one device) solutions on the device. <br><br>  Consider an example.  In a typical case, when connecting an office to a provider or different offices, one has to use several devices.  Each of these devices performs its function (channel-forming device, router, Firewall, switch, SBC, gateway, QoS / QoE agent, etc.).  In the case of using AudioCodes routers, there is no need to use multiple devices.  One of our devices can simultaneously perform several or all of the following roles: <br><ul><li>  Channeling equipment - various types of WAN interfaces (optics, copper, SHDSL 2/4 wired, E1).  You can use up to 3 WAN interfaces simultaneously. </li><li>  Static and Dynamic Routing Router (RIP1, RIP2, OSPFv2, BGPv4) </li><li>  Switch with GE / FE </li><li>  Firewall </li><li>  Voice gateway </li><li>  SIP server or IP-PBX </li><li>  Session Border Controller (SBC) </li><li>  QoS / QoE agent for voice and data quality control </li><li>  Methods to ensure fault tolerance for various voice solutions (SAS, CRP, SBC).  Depending on the solution used and the switching scheme, it is possible to build fault-tolerant schemes in different ways (IP-PBX, virtual PBX, TDM backup). </li></ul><br>  Schematically voiced approach is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a03/1fe/610/a031fe61094f41678489094bfafac0b6.jpg"><br><br>  As a result, in the ideal case, you get one device, which runs and implements all or most of the tasks to ensure communication in the offices.  Typical schemes for office inclusions using a SIP trunk and for connecting to the cloud look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f9/a4e/5a7/6f9a4e5a7239453599ce487f46b6316f.jpg"><br><br>  All of the above raises many questions about the stability and performance of such an inclusion scheme.  Multiservice imposes a lot of limitations on performance.  How tenacious is such an application scheme?  How will the device behave, being loaded with several functions?  Different types of traffic exacerbate the situation: HTTP traffic is characterized by a small number of large packets, voice traffic - by a large number of relatively small packets.  What data to use when evaluating performance?  Should encryption be used (encryption + a large number of packets leads to a CPU load of up to 50% or more)?  Whether to perform transcoding (as you know, performance also suffers from this)?  And what if you enable NAT or QoS (by themselves, these functions can reduce packet rates by more than 80%)? <br><br>  AudioCodes has the answers to such questions.  The Mediant architecture contains several computational resources.  We use different CPUs for voice and data processing and our own DSP.  This means that there are separate resources for encryption, transcoding, NAT processing and QoS.  In the end, it gives stable performance.  Data and voice processing does not affect each other.  And stable performance is an IMPORTANT advantage.  And the total numbers when evaluating the performance in the context of the above are not only bits per second, but also packets per second (PPS). <br><br>  Below are the PPS performance test data for some other manufacturers compared to the Mediant 800 for NAT and QoS modes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b7/4b0/82a/1b74b082ac7a4c13809fed6a33b14866.jpg"><br><br>  Another important issue during a conversation about routers is its ability to route traffic and other traditional features of routers.  We will not go into lengthy discussions, for review we restrict ourselves to basic information, and for details we will direct the reader to the descriptions on the site ( <a href="http://www.audiocodes.com/multi-service-business-router-msbr">http://www.audiocodes.com/multi-service-business-router-msbr</a> ). <br><br>  <b>Data routing</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ PPP, MLPPP, PPPoE, PPPoA, L2TP, IPoE, IPoA <br>  ‚Ä¢ ATM: Up to 8 PVCs <br>  ‚Ä¢ OAM-F5 (send / receive): loopback, continuity check <br>  ‚Ä¢ Shaping: UBR, VBR-NRT, VBR-RT, CBR <br>  ‚Ä¢ DHCP Client, Relay, server <br>  ‚Ä¢ VLAN, VRF <br>  ‚Ä¢ Layer 3 routing and Layer 2 bridging, Jumbo frames <br>  ‚Ä¢ Internal layer 2 switching <br>  ‚Ä¢ Static and dynamic routing (RIP1, RIP2, OSPFv2, BGPv4), Policy-Based Routing <br>  ‚Ä¢ Multicast routing: IGMPv2 / 3 <br>  ‚Ä¢ IPv6, IPv6 / IPv4 Dual Stack, ICMPv6, DHCPv6, SLAAC <br><br>  <b>Data security</b> <br><ul><li>  IPSec, GRE, L2TP </li><li>  ESP - Tunnel mode </li><li>  Encryption (AES, DES, 3DES) </li><li>  Authentication Header </li><li>  IKE mode - IPsec VPN </li><li>  IDS / IPS: </li></ul>  - Fragmented traffi <br>  - Malformed Request <br>  - Ping of Death <br>  - Properly formed request from unauthenticated source <br>  - DDoS attack <br>  - SYN flood <br><ul><li>  Stateful packet inspection firewall </li><li>  DMZ </li><li>  Port triggering </li><li>  Packet filtering </li><li>  Application layer gateway </li></ul><br>  All configuration can be done through the command line.
