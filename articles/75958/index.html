I was doubly pleased with the purchase when I found on the company's website the opportunity to upgrade Windows to the new Seven for free, after it was released (the cost of shipping a disc of $ 20 with a bit does not count).

      But it was not so rosy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To begin with, I entered the support section of <a href="http://packardbell.ru/">the site</a> to download the latest drivers.  To enter used the serial number.  He was fine and they let me into the right section. <br><br>  Later, I tried to register a laptop for a future OS upgrade and here I was in for a surprise. <br>  At the stage of registration of the serial number I was informed that the number is not correct or entered incorrectly. <br>  The tip indicated a photo of the Acer laptop serial, starting with the LX.  (my serial starts with a PC). <br>  I tried to enter all the numbers from the box and their combinations, but nothing came up. <br>  Then he wrote in support.  In the letter I described the problem, brought all the serials and ... did not get any answer.  A week later, I called the support line, where I was told that my letter was probably lost since I sent it on Saturday, when the support is not working.  And on my problem they suggested contacting managers immediately, on the same phone, if there is no answer by mail. <br>  ‚ÄúStrange,‚Äù I thought, and after waiting a few more days I wrote again. <br>  The result was the same.  Two weeks absolutely no response. <br><br>  I called support again.  This time a very polite specialist immediately understood what they were talking about.  He asked if I introduced the correct serial.  (By the way there are three numbers: p / n, short s / n and a long 22-digit number without a name) <br>  It turned out that true.  Sometimes correctly enter p / n + s / n, sometimes this long. <br>  In my case, it turned out that the 11th digit of the long number was 8, which meant that the laptop was released in 2008 and could not be updated since Windows 7 was released in 2009.  Thus, the presence of licensed whists, specifying the model in the list for upgrade and purchasing a laptop during the period designated by Microsoft in which it will be possible to carry out the upgrade do not allow me to make Windows 7 Upgrade. <br><br>  I am disappointed.  Probably abroad this could not happen. <br>  Tell Habralyudi, is there anything you can do about it?  Can I count on an upgrade?  I do not want to pay the full cost of the seven (I have already paid for Vista).  I am able to download and install pirates, but since the possibility of an upgrade has been successfully turned up, I would like to get what I promised.  Yes, and use the license is still nicer and safer. <br><br>  <i>thanks for the karma.</i>  <i>Transferred to a thematic blog.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75958/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75958/</a></p>
