From year to year, manufacturers and experts in the field of software security created an integrated DRM protection against launch without a license key.  This is especially true for games that focus on single player mode. <br><br>  Now, in the era of broadband Internet and the dominance of the network genre over single player titles, the availability of protection for developers and publishers (especially for publishers) was more important than ever.

      The latest loud titles, such as Tomb Raider about the new adventures of Lara Croft and DOOM from Bethesda, were equipped with Denuvo protection. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Some time ago, information about the hackers from CONSPIR4CY working on Denuvo hacking began to appear on the network.  The developers of the latter declared that it was impossible to crack their protection.  However, before them such statements were made by the creators of the Russian StarForce (who drank a lot of blood to players with licensed discs due to incorrect work) and other developers. <br><br>  Since nothing is perfect, Denuvo, like his brothers, fell under the pressure of burglars.  Of course, it took much more time and the developers managed to get the main ‚Äúcream‚Äù from sales of Tomb Raider and DOOM, but the fact that the next ‚Äúunbreakable‚Äù system fell was already a sign. <br><br>  Hacking Denuvo took place in two stages. <br><br>  On the first, the hackers found a way to trick the software of the Steam digital distribution site and issue the files of the desired game after another free title.  Thus, the game was launched and worked under the guise of another project. <br><br>  This method was fraught with obvious risks of getting a ban and its use was highly recommended from under the fake account in order to avoid losing the game library and the entire account. <br><br>  Now the Denuvo system is fully hacked and already several titles under its protection (Tomb Rider and the new DOOM) are available on torrent trackers for download.  What is important, full-fledged hacking implies the <b>ability to start the game without Steam</b> . <br><br>  On the other hand, the fight against piracy is not the only way for developers not to go around the world with an outstretched hand.  The creators of one of the loudest projects in recent years, The Witcher 3, the Poles from CD Projekt RED, believed in people and did not stop trying to "save" their game - there was simply no DRM protection in Witcher.  However, this fact did not prevent thousands of gamers around the world from buying the game at least out of respect for the creators (from the author of the publication, she has been gathering in the library with all DLC for $ 60 for more than a year and has never regretted anything). <br><br>  Information on hacking and use instructions is posted by members of CONSPIR4CY <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackStatus/comments/4wqoqj/riseofthetombraiderreadnfoconspir4cy/">on Reddit</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396607/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396607/</a></p>
