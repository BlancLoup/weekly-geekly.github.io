  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CES 2015 through the eyes of a programmer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Show">The Consumer Electronics Show (CES)</a> annually attracts 3000+ exhibiting companies and 150-160 thousand visitors and places them in several complexes.  The center is the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), where Samsung and Sony corporations are located on several floors.  However, this year I was struck at CES by not huge crooked mirrors (excuse me, <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/tvs-at-ces-2015-go-beyond-4k/">TVs</a> ), not a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DvXmxsY1OT4M">flock of self-coordinating drones</a> , not <a href="http://www.cnet.com/products/dell-xps-13-2015/">weightless laptops</a> from large corporations, but small companies that do small things with great potential that were placed in a small one (compared to LVCC ) Showroom Sands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae8/25b/c68/ae825bc68f6a47d799c1a3dcf6e1ae50.png"><br><br>  I think it is no exaggeration that this year there was an explosion of IoT.  If before IoT modestly huddled on a few scattered stands, now it took almost a whole exhibition complex, where you could see dozens of smart watches, robots who could control the house and even cook, 3D printers, fitness devices, muscle composition meters, fat, bone density, smart beds, all sorts of wearables and even <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102295792">hearables</a> .  IDC predicts that by 2020 the IoT market <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp%3FcontainerId%3DprUS25237214">will be measured in trillions already.</a>

      This, of course, is very interesting for us - consumers, but what does this mean for us - programmers? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. Data from all these devices will need to be collected and sent to the server.  Via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy">BLE</a> , <a href="http://www.zigbee.org/">ZigBee</a> , <a href="https://allseenalliance.org/developers/learn">AllJoyn ‚Ñ¢</a> , etc.  The data will first go to some smarter device with a larger battery (or connected to the network) or a phone - let's call it gateway, and it will already in turn communicate with the server via the Internet.  The frameworks like <a href="http://devicehive.com/">DeviceHive</a> (shameless plug) and <a href="http://www.openhab.org/">openHAB help</a> simplify communication with devices, but programmers still have a lot of work to do. <br><br>  2. Data will need to be stored and analyzed somewhere, but there will be not just a lot of them, but a lot of them.  Now a couple billion people are connected to the Internet and the number of tweets, posts, photos and clicks on sites that everyone can accumulate is limited. <br><br>  There will be tens of billions of devices (each of us has several), and they will send ‚Äúto the clouds‚Äù the temperature in each room, in the refrigerator, air humidity, car metrics, cardiogram, pressure, blood oxygen saturation, glucose level, hemoglobin, not to mention already about the banal steps and other activities.  And this is only what came to mind, and what is already being done now.  Undoubtedly, this list will only expand. <br><br>  As a result, the concept of Big Data will become commonplace and disappear - everything will be Big Data.  The data will flow, and users will want to see real-time results.  The grandfather Hadoop, already breathing its last, will move and give way to technologies like <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a> + <a href="https://spark.apache.org/streaming/">Spark Streaming</a> , queues such as <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> and <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> and generally asynchronous technologies like <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a> and <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> will become more and more relevant. <br><br>  NoSQL databases like <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a> will be even more common.  DBA and scaling specialists will have something to do.  If you are jealous of Apple engineers (75,000 Cassandra nodes, 10 PB data) or Netflix (2,500 nodes, 420 TB), soon this power will be in your hands.  Even more will be needed Data Scientists, which now and so is not enough.  Some of my friends for 30 dug up a portfolio and went to get a second education.  You can start at least with <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1">Coursera</a> . <br><br>  3. Of course, we will be asked to develop new applications for managing this zoo device and for data visualization.  Apparently, success awaits those who figure out how to orchestrate and integrate it all, so as not to be confused in dozens of separate applications, one for each smart ashtray and toaster, and also provide opportunities that are inaccessible to individual devices / applications.  For example, I want, when I twisted in the morning, to open the curtains so that they would wake me gently in the light sleep phase for the last 30 minutes before I had to wake up on the alarm clock ... <br><br>  We were somewhat distracted from the exhibition itself, but it was very important to reflect the criticality of the moment.  What was invented back in the 20th century and what has been talked and written a lot about lately - robots, smart houses, etc. - is now finally becoming a reality.  Do not believe about the XIX century?  See <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US613809">Nikola Tesla's patent on the remote control of a car</a> from 1898 :).  And now, in 2015, at the exhibition, the representative of the BMW c Samsung Gear S watches gave the team a new i3 to go ahead, and then fearlessly jumped in front of her to demonstrate the anti-collision system.  Video <a href="http://gizmodo.com/remote-driving-a-bmw-with-a-smartwatch-feels-prepostero-1677794063">here</a> . <br><br>  But back to CES.  I bring to your attention a list of companies / products that struck me or just liked. <br><br><h2>  LifeQ </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/078/d0d/6ef/078d0d6efadd4ce1b4a48ed95474a0e1.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://lifeq.com/">For</a> four years, <a href="http://lifeq.com/">LifeQ</a> company quietly worked on its technology and only at CES came out of the twilight.  Through continuous monitoring of physiological parameters in tandem with biomathematical modeling (also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology">computational systems biology</a> ), the guys from LifeQ are going to completely change what we know about ourselves and how we make decisions. <br><br>  I am superficially familiar with system biology and naively believed that this new field of science is still in its infancy, and its application in real life, and even more so in commercial products is not yet possible, however, apparently, ‚Äúthe technology is secret, scientists might not know ".  I was also amazed when I learned that Cape Town in South Africa, where half of LifeQ scientists work, is a major center for computational systems biology research.  Live and learn. <br><br>  How exactly will it work? <br><br>  1. Device manufacturers are implementing LifeQ LENS technology in various fitness devices.  Using a multi-wavelength optical sensor device removes the primary indicators from the body. <br><br>  2. LifeQ CORE - the main innovation of the company - accepts the primary indicators, models the physiological systems and calculates additional indicators that cannot be obtained directly (without analysis in the laboratory). <br><br>  3. Through the open platform of LifeQ LINK, developers integrate technology into existing or develop new applications and thus provide ordinary people with information about what actually happens to their body. <br><br><h2>  Ozobot </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4a/dde/827/c4adde827dd04ce796beb0d17fb4324a.png" alt="Ozobot"><br><br>  This two-centimeter baby in stature attracted more attention to CES than teen-sized robots.  And it is not surprising: not only is it cute, it also solves an important task - it makes programming more accessible.  In general, the topic ‚Äúprogramming skills for everyone!‚Äù Has recently become incredibly popular.  Like mushrooms after the rain, new simplified languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> and visual environments like <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly/">Blockly</a> appear, online courses and ‚Äúacademies‚Äù are multiplying, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2014/12/10/what-program-did-obama-write-to-kick-off-hour-of-code-2014/">Barack Obama writes in JavaScript</a> during the Coding Hour. <br><br>  And then the company Evollve, who created Ozobot, did something brilliant: she figured out how to program with the help of drawing!  Now not only Barack Obama - even George W. Bush can do it, not to mention children of primary school age. <br><br>  How it works: you draw lines with a marker on paper (or with a finger on an ipad), solid lines create a road along which ozobot will go, and using a combination of colors you can give different commands, for example, ‚Äústop‚Äù, ‚Äúgo faster‚Äù, ‚Äú turbo mode ‚Äù, etc. After you have drawn a road program and put a robot on it, it will begin to carry out the instructions yourself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b7c/453/281/b7c453281d378590a32d3035c3e0aedd.jpg" alt="image"><br>  ( <a href="http://www.gadgetreview.com/2015/01/ozobot-review-a-colorful-robot-2">from here</a> ) <br><br>  Here is a list of supported commands: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/869/e89/69e/869e8969e554941e035b985ac028ca65.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  JINS MEME </h2><br><br>  The Japanese company JINS, until recently, made ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù frames and excellent aspherical (not distorting reality) lenses.  But this was not enough for them, and they decided to make the glasses smart. <br><br>  Having added a three-point <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrooculography">electrooculography</a> , a six-axis accelerometer and a gyroscope, they received <a href="https://www.jins-jp.com/jinsmeme/en/">JINS MEME</a> smart glasses that can not only determine the direction of gaze and blink moments, but also understand whether we are focused or drowsy and how even we stand / walk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c18/a51/aad/c18a51aad26a4fe6ac31146c0ce53df0.png"><br><br>  The most interesting thing for us, of course, is the API and the SDK, which JINS MEME is going to release in March of this year.  According to their <a href="http://developers.jins.com/en/">Developer Portal</a> , the API will support two modes: ‚Äúreal time‚Äù and ‚Äústandard‚Äù. <br><br>  In real time we get: <br><br><ul><li>  Eyes: eye movements, moments of blinking, speed of blinking, power of blinking (need to be the same!). </li><li>  Body: position / balance, speed, acceleration. </li><li>  Device: battery data, assessment of how well the glasses are worn, error information. </li></ul><br>  In standard mode, statistics on the same metrics will be available every minute, plus: <br><br><ul><li>  Level of sleepiness </li><li>  Level of focus </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be7/d6c/98c/be7d6c98c4ed49e1910e79e328085944.png"><br><br><h2>  Opticwash </h2><br><br>  At the end of the topic of points, I would like to present a brilliant creation from the company Opticwash - wash-basin! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/480/9a1/417/4809a14179aa445a9f42df505aae839d.png"><br><br>  They do not have an SDK or API :), but if your glasses, like mine, are constantly getting dirty, washing will be a very useful device.  Yes, and look at - a pleasure.  I risked my glasses and didn‚Äôt lose - it‚Äôs impossible to clean them perfectly with my hands.  Watch the video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-7615C0fQo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjLocnPiGuDjA71sohh1Ddce8hKLw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  You can still wash the jewelry, but somehow tested on the wedding ring.  If something goes wrong, what then will I say at home ?!  ‚ÄúCan you imagine, dear, there was such a machine at the conference that washes rings, and she swallowed mine ...‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374721/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374721/</a></p>
