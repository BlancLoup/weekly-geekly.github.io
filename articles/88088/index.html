This is an unreal disgrace. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/blackbox-ru/view/149841/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e2f/bd5/4f1/e2fbd54f1164648d3b436765dbf9a03a.jpg" width="288" height="500" title="career-day.ru" alt="career-day.ru"></a> <br><br>  In the design of the site the style of "corporate gothic" was chosen.  The composition starts the scoreboard with a moving line of meaningless text.  In the center of the site we see an openwork, carefully licked stained-glass window from meaningless, but filled with highly corporate spirituality arrows, made ‚Äúunder the aqua of translucent‚Äù.  Two retouched office gargoyles complete the picture. <br><br><blockquote>  Gargulia - dragon, used in the design of architectural monuments in the Gothic style.  Since there is no point in depicting people on the site (who is it? What are they doing here? What do they have to tell me?), These people play the role of a ‚Äúfiller of design with corporate meaning‚Äù.  This is a common stereotype among narrow-minded people that strict clothing adds intelligence and organization.  The stereotype comes from the early clipart ‚Äúabout businessmen talking to a phone the size of a brick‚Äù supposedly from the end of the 80s.  That is, it is a ritual element to cover the lack of ideas. </blockquote><br>  The format of the site as a ritual object is most often chosen from the desire to please every visitor;  do so  "Blowjob just in case" to all readers, including search engines.  In fact, the overall composition with arrows and two gargoyles produces a clear sense of deception, because everyone who wants to ride on the terms ‚Äúsuccess, loot, leadership, use it today, send 10 rubles and get 100 tomorrow.‚Äù  This is a total shame and evidence of the creative impotence of all those who participated in this project.

      Farther. <br><br>  Under the elbows of the gargoyles, the design money ran out and then everything was mixed in a heap indiscriminately. <br><br>  I just don‚Äôt know where to start here, because I don‚Äôt touch it, everything leads to some kind of senseless despondency.  After carefully reading the site, I tried to restore the meaning, and go from it. <br><br><h2>  Idea </h2><br>  The meaning of the event is that there are many students who need a job, and many employers who need young specialists.  As a result, someone will find a job, and someone will find workers.  This is a fairly simple and understandable idea that emerges from afar through the last paragraphs of the text on the first page.  Or does not appear. <br><br><h2>  What should visitors do </h2><br>  Students must submit the form, employers do not know what to do.  Probably call.  The result of visiting the site is unclear, and it is unclear how the student will guess to fill this form.  The main thing is how he will guess why he needs it at all. <br><br><h2>  Good thing the project will not be called </h2><br>  Panic fear of the organizers in the demonstration of the result leads to reports and reviews in the style of "we have a cool hang out."  The main question is: ‚ÄúHas anyone found a job?‚Äù This distinguishes the project from a serious matter.  The result. <br><br><h2>  Actually, the recommendations. </h2><br><ol><li>  Tell about the event without using long abstruse words. </li><li>  Show people who have already been at the event and their opinions. </li><li>  Show clear entry points for two audiences: students and employers. </li><li>  Compose reports on past events in html (you would have typed in typhus). </li><li>  In extreme cases, pay the designer to finish the site to the very bottom. </li><li>  Search for people who have found a job.  Take their recommendations on the event. </li><li>  All those who write in the forms "FULL NAME" are awaiting the careers of the janitor.  Decent people use the ‚ÄúWhat is your name‚Äù design.  Polite such a design. </li><li>  Even decent people do not impose a uniform like this. </li></ol><br><h2>  Summary </h2><br>  The case is probably good, but it looks like shit. <br><br>  <i>Links to review sites people <a href="http://www.blackbox.ru/company/blog/fresh-meat/">send voluntarily</a> , all reviews are on the tag " <a href="http://www.blackbox.ru/company/blog/_tag/obzory_sajjtov/">site reviews</a> ".</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88088/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88088/</a></p>
