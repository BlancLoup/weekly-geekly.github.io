  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Enlightenment (e18), ROSA R @ and vs-e vs-e vs-e</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just recently, the release of the Enlightenment window manager (e18) was released, and even earlier, the ROSA distribution also released an update of the ROSA FRESH R2 package base and it was not by chance that e18 was collected for dew just a few hours ago. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of the interesting things in the new E18, they implemented support for sound events in the code, in addition to all the E17 bug fixes, in E18 there is already a new EFL and Elementary library, which are not foreseen in version 17, because even the approach to numbering libraries and resolving dependencies has changed - for example, E18 will not work with elm&gt; = 1.9 - this is an interesting approach, because the numbering structure of libraries appears, which clearly indicates the compatibility of the code and perhaps the branch. <br>  Asynchronous rearing is being implemented - e18, in essence opengl-wm and each object is rendered by a software or hardware-based 3D engine, e18 only works with the composite turned on (transparency), and in e19 it is already planned to switch from serial to parallel distribution of streams for rendering objects in evas.  E19 does not apply for work, but only for tests, because.  Old topics from E17 are no longer suitable for E18, but these are all such trifles, it may be more interesting for someone to read the library code, but I just like it. <br>  In Rosa, glamor is being implemented now, which also translates 2D through GL, because it is arranged somewhat differently in KEDA, in e it is already sharpened and work is being done on structuring, correcting errors ... the GLUe-key also happens. <br>  In the new version, everything is new, after all, the new year is coming soon, so whoever wants to refresh himself and put <a href="http://www.rosalab.ru/blogs/rosa-predstavlyaet-rosa-desktop-fresh-r2">ROSA FRESH R2</a> then this is the way to ( <a href="https://enlightenment.org/p.php%3Fp%3Ddownload%26l%3Den">enlightenment</a> ) a bright future, I remind you that ROSA is rpm-based distro, turnips need to be connected via drakrpm or urpm [+ tab], now e18 is in the <a href="http://abf-downloads.rosalinux.ru/enlightenment_backports_personal/repository/rosa2012.1/">test repository</a> , <br>  , and e17 is enabled via task-e17 <br>  if you want to discuss, then <a href="http://forum.rosalab.ru/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D39%26t%3D2854">there is a forum</a> <br>  On the site there are other distros to sweat. <br>  for bug reports on e18 - <a href="https://enlightenment.org/">enlightenment.org</a> welcome to E, there's an irc channel, in general there are also programmers needed, but of course with certain skills, the code is available in the <a href="https://phab.enlightenment.org/">printer</a> . <br>  In the dew, from small fixes (I have an old R1 installation through magic, after deba) you can check for the absence of extra disks in fstab, but this is not necessary, first you need the system to stand up.  By default, KDE goes, the list of official available packages can be viewed at <a href="http://pkgs.org/">pkgs.org</a> , and with informal ones everything becomes more interesting every day, because work on this is in full swing (except weekends and holidays Moscow time) and some packages run from openmandriva to rosa and vice versa , all just because of the package assembly system implemented in dew.  In magos, the same base of packages is used and it is quite convenient to raise the system through the magos (changing a couple of lines in the configs is easy). <br>  In fact, in the innovation, interesting themes are realized with animation of objects, and shared libraries are used for writing their applications, there are few of them now, but in fact one of the major Korean companies seemed to be using e on their dialers, so some prospects are possible.  Given the 3D interface, you can try the implementation of some mini-games, maybe or try to create a new interface, which will already be true 3d, unlike Compiz, which is often buggy in virtual machines. <br>  In general, there is a deep-field of features to realise - it is not easy, but already possible. </div>
