This makes shooting sports inaccessible to most. <br>  In this post I want to discuss an alternative that, without losing the quality of training, will make them available to almost everyone, there would be a desire. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <sup>This article was published on Habr√©, but for obvious reasons (brutal offtopic for Habr) was removed from there.</sup> <sup><br></sup>  <sup>It seems to me that the topic of the article is quite suitable for GT and will be appropriate.</sup>  <sup>If I'm wrong, please do not immediately ban!</sup> <sup><br></sup>  <sup>The article is published without changes, in the form in which it was published on Habr√©.</sup>  <sup>The purpose of the publication is to get the same discussion that was before and attract new people to the PS.</sup> <sup><br></sup> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Who am I and why am I writing this text</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I want to tell a little about myself who I am and why I touch on this topic at all. <br>  You will not lose anything if you close this spoiler and continue to read the text outside of it.

      I am a programmer who has been developing software for an interactive shooting gallery in Elitcom LLC for about 5 years. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/aeSOLJnw8p4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiQbONzfGxb2-JGYzQ9cwpKZavi7w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In 2008 I was invited to this project by a programmer.  My work is the core and graphics engine. <br>  Six months ago, tired of the project, I left Elitcom.  Now the project is developing without me. <br>  I did not spoil relations with Elitcom, and from time to time they share successes in the development of the project. <br>  A month ago, the owners of ‚ÄúElitcom‚Äù told that they were developing a laser pistol with a complete imitation of the work of a conventional firearm, with the exception of the departure of a striking element. <br>  I am not aware of the implementation details, as this is a commercial secret.  This post is an attempt to think about how I would make this gun so that it would be as effective as possible in terms of replacing real weapons and at the same time being as accessible as possible. <br>  I also informed the owners of ‚ÄúElitcom‚Äù that I plan to discuss this topic widely, no bans have been received. <br>  True, they did not give permission to show videos with the work of their prototype, so I will not publish the video here. <br></div></div><br><br>  The main goal of the work is to create such a gun so that training with its use does not differ from training with the use of a real weapon.  But it is important to comply with the following requirements: <br><ul><li>  You do not need a special room for shooting. </li><li>  The gun is available for free purchase and use. </li><li>  Cartridges are available for free purchase. </li><li>  The price of the cartridge is minimal </li><li>  Completely safe for others. </li></ul><br><br>  The mechanism of the gun that meets these requirements is extremely simple: <br>  We insert a laser and a piston into the barrel of a real pistol, on which, when fired, press the generated gases. <br>  The cartridge is an empty sleeve with a cap.  Capsule power is enough to press the piston and, at the same time, fully interact with the gate. <br><br>  It is worth discussing implementation details separately. <br><br><h5>  Ammunition equipment </h5><br>  Perhaps this is the easiest part of the whole project. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c0/d2e/aaf/4c0d2eaafc36f8a2c4284184fb138ef7.jpg"><br>  The cartridge in our case consists of only two parts: <br><ul><li>  Sleeve </li><li>  Capsule </li></ul><br>  The sleeve of a suitable caliber can be shot.  The main thing that she was not bloated and freely entered the chamber. <br>  Caps are sold freely and cost from 1 to 5 rubles. <br>  The liner is reusable and the cost of the shot is reduced to the cost of replacing the capsule. <br><br><h5>  Pistol </h5><br>  Legally difficult part of the project. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4a/4ed/ba2/b4a4edba253722f29eca514a2ef027ca.jpg"><br>  Fortunately, there is such a thing as MMG (Layout Mass-Dimensional).  In fact, it is an ordinary gun with changes that resulted in it ceasing to be a firearm and became a decorative item. <br>  There are many options for the conversion of firearms.  For example, filling the barrel with metal, which guarantees the unsuitability of the use of weapons for firing.  For obvious reasons, this conversion option is not suitable for our task. <br>  Fortunately, there is another version of the conversion: holes are drilled at regular intervals in the barrel of the weapon. <br>  The gun remains fully functional, but when you try to shoot a live cartridge, the barrel is torn. <br>  The gun after such a conversion is fully suitable for our task, but it is freely sold and does not require any documents either for purchase or for wearing. <br>  The best option for an ordinary athlete is to buy a cheap used traumatic pistol for a low-power cartridge, for example, Walther P22T and then convert it to MMG. <br>  Unfortunately, I do not have information about the conversion procedure. <br><blockquote>  Do you have information on how to legally convert a traumatic gun?  What does this procedure look like, how much does it cost and can it be done by an individual? <br>  Write your opinion in the comments. <br></blockquote><br><br><h5>  Laser block </h5><br>  Structurally difficult part of the project. <br>  The laser unit, in theory, looks very simple: the laser itself, the battery, the button and the piston that presses the button. <br>  The main difficulty lies in the fact that all this we need to cram into the barrel of a gun, which is not characterized by the presence of a large free space. <br>  Trunk incision with laser block inside: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b96/6e1/7dc/b966e17dc7572436a44d0d514e3a8a88.png"><br>  List of individual parts: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69a/edf/720/69aedf7200fed19cb96c4437e96c7808.png"><br><ol><li>  Insert into the barrel with partitions that will not allow the piston to leave the working area </li><li>  Laser assembly.  Inside the laser itself, batteries, and behind the button sticks out, when pressed, the laser turns on. </li><li>  External powerful spring designed to dampen the blow to the piston </li><li>  Inner weak spring pushing button </li><li>  The piston, under the influence of gases moving in the working area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe barrel </li><li>  Cartridge without powder and striking element </li></ol><br>  The distance between the cartridge and the piston is of fundamental importance. <br>  If the distance is too large, then the cap power may not be enough for all reloading mechanisms to work properly. <br>  If the distance is too small, the recharging will be initiated ahead of time and at the time of ejection of the liner the burning reaction will not end.  So, this reaction will occur already in the open air, which will lead to a flash from the side of the ejector.  Not deadly, but loud, bright and not pleasant. <br>  The question of laser alignment in the barrel remains unsolved. <br><blockquote>  Do you have any idea how to adjust the laser so that it is convenient, not too difficult and reliable enough? <br>  Write your ideas in the comments. </blockquote><br><br><h5>  Target construction </h5><br>  Obviously, the pistol of the discussed design is not capable of hitting targets. <br>  So, the question arises of detecting hits. <br>  The gun can be used with systems designed to work with conventional laser guns.  For example, Striker, about which I spoke in a spoiler, can handle hitting a laser beam on a screen. <br>  But Striker is worth the money and considerable.  At the same time, its capabilities are redundant for regular shooting exercises. <br>  Therefore, I propose to discuss a simple and cheap version of targets suitable for use. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/414/d58/480/414d584800153671092727243d9b0232.jpg"><br>  The target is a sheet of plywood with an image of the target pasted on top. <br>  Nearby is a camera aimed at the target. <br>  The camera connects to the controller (for example, to a smartphone). <br>  Next we have two options: <br><ol><li><h6>  Simplest </h6><br>  Turn on the controller permanent record. <br>  A conventional camera with FPS 20 is quite enough to capture the laser dot. </li><li><h6>  Difficult, but better </h6><br>  We program the controller so that it saves only those frames on which the laser beam is present and automatically calculated the point of impact on the target.  Plus, of course, the transfer of data to a common server in order to track the shooting results in real time. </li></ol><br>  But the second option has the problem of highlighting the laser beam. <br>  In the case of unstable street lighting, interference with the camera is quite possible.  Often changing the level of illumination is difficult to adjust. <br><br><h4>  the total cost </h4><br><ul><li> Pistol.  The cost of a gun varies greatly.  The base price can be considered 10 000 rubles.  Approximately from this sum begins any choice. </li><li>  Conversion of the gun in MMG - in question.  It is not known how the conversion is made and how much it costs. </li><li>  Laser block.  The laser itself costs 10 cents a pack.  But the cost of assembling all depends on the involvement of third-party specialists.  The cost of parts is about 100 rubles.  The assembly will be released in 1-2 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Cartridges.  Sleeves cost nothing and will gladly give them in kilograms in any dash.  The price of the capsule varies from 1 to 5 rubles - depending on the greed of the seller. </li><li>  Target.  If you follow a simple path, you can simply plug in a smartphone with an integrated camera.  Now Android smartphone costs 1000 rubles.  If you take an external normal camera, then you need a smartphone with OTG or another controller.  The price for them starts from 1500 rubles for a controller or 2500 for a smartphone with OTG.  Cameras cost from 500 rubles. </li></ul><br><h6>  Total: </h6><br>  the minimum cost of the kit (gun + one target, conversion is temporarily considered free) 12,000 rubles <br>  shot cost - 3 rubles. <br>  The gun turns out to be practically eternal, as it is designed for much more serious loads than those to which it will be subjected. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  The gun received as a result of our labors is completely legal and safe. <br>  Of course, at home or in the yard you should not shoot from it.  Although it is not dangerous, but noisy, and the neighbors will be unhappy. <br>  But to arrange training in the near career or at the cottage, no one will interfere. <br>  The cost of the shot is 10 times lower than the present!  Not everyone can afford to throw out 8,000 per workout every month.  A completely different thing - 800 rubles.  This can afford literally everyone. <br>  At the same time, there are no losses in the quality of training.  All the same, only there is no striking element. <br>  The absence of a striking element is also very important when learning how to shoot adolescents. <br>  Many of us remember the horrible story about a boy who died in archery training. <br>  But the gun is much more dangerous. <br>  What a sin to conceal, I myself was on the verge of an accident due to a confluence of several coincidences, although I take safety precautions very seriously when handling weapons. <br>  Using laser imitation, you can fearlessly attract teenagers to this interesting sport and not think about an accident. <br><br><h5>  PS&gt; </h5>  It is worth noting that everything written is fully applicable not only to pistols, but also to other firearms. <br>  But at rifle distances there is the problem of accounting for wind. <br>  Taking into account the wind system is much more complicated.  And without taking into account the wind - does not make sense on rifles and carbines. <br><br>  UPD: <br>  On Habr√© time to mention a very interesting moment: <br>  The most problematic part of the whole idea is the creation of a suitable MMG. <br>  It turned out that there is already a suitable serial pistol based on the Makarov MP-371 pistol. <br>  The design of this gun completely coincides with the scheme MMG necessary for building a laser gun and at the same time, the use of such a gun is completely legal. <br>  Special mechanics are used for the mechanics, which are also legally sold and do not require any permits. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/487/ce2/2bd/487ce22bda0f1485878aa46f2d8c16a1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  UPD2: <br>  User <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/gomelkiev/" class="user_link">GomelKiev</a> provided a link to a good, albeit rather expensive, alternative: <br>  <a href="http://www.dvorakinstruments.com/Products/Glock-17-(ARS).asp">www.dvorakinstruments.com/Products/Glock-17-(ARS).asp</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/361771/">https://habr.com/ru/post/361771/</a></p>
