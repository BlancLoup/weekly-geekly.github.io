      To not write on the Internet, the appearance of the hero does not make an impression at all.  This is the usual black tube, absolutely nothing to hook the eye on.  The only distinguishing feature is the raised lower part of the body, but with it I was more connected with possible inconveniences.  I thought that in the pocket, for example, of jeans, the curved part would be felt, but it turned out that there was no problem with that.  In comparison with the 5800, it is noticeable that the Hero is thinner, the jeans pocket does not bulge.  But he is heavier, so, for example, in a coat, he significantly delays the pocket. <br><br>  Most of the body (back cover, bevels, the platform under the screen, part of the ends) are covered with black velvety plastic, which is now commonly called soft-touch.  This plastic is not only that brand, but also likes to collect dust and any small garbage. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Screen</b> <br><br>  The capacitive screen is closed on top, as I understand it, with glass.  Fat divorces (the trouble of all touch-screen devices) on it are visible to a much lesser extent than on the 5800 screen, but, on the other hand, they are practically not cleaned off even with a wet and then dry cloth.  The screen will always be stained, but with about the same slight degree. <br><br>  Around the screen is a metal frame that makes up the corners of the device and reaches the middle of the ends.  Visually it is not visible, it is painted in the color of the case, but to the touch the presence of metal is noticeable, it pleasantly cools the hand and creates a sense of reliability. <br><br>  As far as I know, you can buy a white case that looks much better and does not have the same soft plastic, which I rather did not like with my carelessness.  There is such a case separately 4500, that is, the price is far from the most modest mobile phone. <br><br>  The device itself is assembled tightly.  There are no backlashes, creaks, no gaps.  The only complaint is the camera window.  When talking, the index finger tries to get into it, and the camera itself is not protected by anything, so I think you shouldn‚Äôt poke your fingers there. <br><br>  The screen diagonally is exactly the same as that of the 5800, but it has a slightly different shape.  It is wider and lower.  Large width gives greater comfort when working with the interface.  The only thing that really requires a wide screen is video viewing. <br><br>  It would be wrong to say that the screen has high sensitivity, since all capacitive screens work by touching, not pressing.  For example, in HTC Viva there is a resistive screen, but the sensations are as if it is capacitive, it reacts so sensitively to touches.  5800 has a completely different song.  You can safely put your finger on it, nothing will happen, until you notice the pressure with your finger.  Very good screen sensitivity to touch is noticeable even when pressed, and when moving objects, scrolling lists.  For example, in 5800 I could not manage without the stylus to arrange the icons in the menu.  They were constantly lost on the road, before reaching the right place.  In Hero with this full order. <br><br>  I have no complaints about the screen itself.  The picture is beautiful, although, of course, it does not shake in chromaticity, as on OLED screens.  The white color seems slightly yellowish, but only slightly and for some reason in street lighting.  By the way, on the street the screen remains readable even in the sun.  No problem with viewing angles.  A direct comparison with the 5800 screen clearly indicates that the screen in Nokia strongly gives in blue.  By resolution, the Hero's screen is inferior to Nokia, but this is completely invisible.  On the contrary, the Hero's interface is drawn an order of magnitude better than that of the 5800, so the picture seems more detailed. <br><br>  <b>Interface</b> <br><br>  As I already wrote above, the interface in Hero is drawn ON ORDER better than in 5800. There is no comparison.  When, after a day of communication with the Hero, you take 5800 in your hands, its menus, elements, buttons seem rude and coarse. <br><br>  So, we come to the most interesting part - Android and proprietary shell HTC Sense.  It will be difficult for me to examine them individually, since I did not have another phone, for example, with a bare android. <br><br>  The ideology of the Android is so different from the ideology of the Nokia smartphone interface that when you turn on the Hero, the first thought is how to figure it out, where is it, why everything was done that way.  I remember that earlier it was also about the Sony Ericsson devices that did not have the receive and reject keys, but they had additional delete and return keys.  After about a day of swarming in Hero, you begin to understand approximately how everything is arranged here, where is it and how to get to it.  The instructions in the kit are very conditional, so I mastered the device at random. <br><br>  As you know, from the menu where all the programs are dumped, you can pull out (copy) the shortcuts of the necessary progs and place them in any convenient place on the desktop.  Such a system strongly resembles Windows.  In addition to shortcuts to programs on a huge desktop, you can place a bunch of different interesting things.  For example, shortcuts to a quick call or sending a message to someone from the contact book.  You can also place folders that open right there within the active part of the desktop.  They can safely place labels or contacts.  Also on the screen you can place widgets of different applications.  In my phone, I did as follows.  In the central part of the desktop, I have a widget of HTC branded watches and weather, as well as 4 main shortcuts - contacts, messages, camera and silent mode.  Another one of the 7 parts of the screen I took for shortcuts programs.  That is, from it I made the familiar analogue of the main menu of Nokia.  Another part of the screen gave under the switches of connections and quick contacts, as well as quick reminders from the calendar.  One part is given for the calendar, sms and player, so the last 7 part is still free.  At first it seems that there is a lot of space, you do not know what to fill it with, and then you start saving J <br><br>  The first thing I decided to get into the Android market.  I installed a 3G sim card in the phone, the benefit of the 3rd generation network in our region works fine.  When entering the android, they asked me for the username and password for the Google account, and if not, they suggested to create it.  I entered my username and password and was very mistaken.  The fact is that by default the phone has full data synchronization with Google account.  So, getting access to my account, while I went to the market, the phone synchronized my mail, contacts and calendar.  The fact is that in my google post all the used email addresses were thrown by default into the phone book, so that there were about 300 entries there that I don‚Äôt need on my phone at all.  Seeing this horror, I erased all contacts from the phone, went through the computer to Google Mail and deleted all contacts there, and then began to compile a new address book, taking data from synchronization with the HUR.  For an hour and a half out of about 250 contacts, I put in order about 100 master records so that I could put my main sim card in the phone.  Synchronized phone with Google Account and that's it!  Everything is fine! <br><br>  From Marketta downloaded several programs, including FBreader for reading books, task killer for unloading tasks from memory, a couple of games, a button for switching to silent mode.  It didn't take that much money.  Literally, I'm going to set up a Wi-Fi router and surf the Internet through a high-speed connection. <br><br>  Continuation will be possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82564/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82564/</a></p>
