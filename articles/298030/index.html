The company analyzed the financial statements of 46 companies represented in Russia, among them - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP">BP</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Shell">Royal Dutch Shell</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank">Deutsche Bank</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens">Siemens</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafarge">Lafarge</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConocoPhillips">ConocoPhillips</a> .  According to Global Counsel, most of them will curtail business in Russia. <br><br>  However, this trend is not evident for all industries.  The forecast mainly relates to the financial sector and energy, in part - to the IT industry.  And for pharmaceuticals, for example, does not apply at all. <a name="habracut"></a>

      In the first half of last year, statistics recorded a record decline in retail sales since 1991 - by 7.9%.  The real incomes of the population fell by 10% by summer, and as a result, according to the consulting company ‚ÄúShop of Shops‚Äù, 991 outlets opened in Russia last year, and 1024 closed. A year earlier, 1234 points were opened and only 314 were closed. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAlmost all international [trading] brands that have recently left the Russian market experienced operational problems, which were often caused by mistakes in building a marketing strategy.  The deterioration of the macroeconomic situation, the devaluation of the national currency and the fall in household incomes have affected them more, ‚Äùcommented Yulia Sitnikova, senior consultant for the Shops Store. <br><br>  Care of retailers is explained not only by errors in the strategy, but also by the stratification of consumers in the middle segment, the thinning of the layer, called the ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  IT cycle in nature </h4><br>  Many experts explain the large-scale exodus of IT companies from Russia for political reasons.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft has</a> transferred the development of Skype to Prague and other cities outside our country.  Previously, it was partially located in Zelenograd.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a> developers (Russian programmers) moved to California, Europe and so on.  The office of the major game developer <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Insight">Game Insight has</a> completely moved, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxoft">Luxoft has</a> transferred hundreds of programmers from Russia to other countries. <br><br>  These companies do not openly declare any political reasons.  All these changes are carried out under the flag of business restructuring. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe integration of engineering offices into larger hubs is not a unique phenomenon in the company, we carried out such changes repeatedly in other countries (in Sweden, Finland, Norway, as well as in several offices in the USA - Austin, Atlanta),‚Äù explained Dengam Google on communications in Russia Alla Zabrovskaya. <br><br>  Also, we should not forget that the departure of companies was preceded by the adoption of a number of laws and discussion at the highest level of new measures to restrict the Internet, the storage of personal data, a ban on the purchase of foreign software. <br><br>  ‚ÄúPreviously, IT was one of the most unregulated industries in Russia, but in the past two years the state has climbed into this area, and many are leaving because of this,‚Äù complains Anton Agranovsky, founder of the developer and publisher of online games <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_Development">Destiny Development</a> . <br><br>  In addition, IT companies are renowned for their extremely delicate attitude towards employees, and this also influenced decision making in a certain way.  ‚ÄúOur industry is very dependent on personnel, and the best employees now do not want to live in Russia, and it‚Äôs very difficult to keep them - they have families, children, they want to live with them in Europe,‚Äù explains Anton Agranovsky. <br><br>  His company Destiny Development is not leaving yet, but several key employees left and emigrated from it, which is very sad for its creator.  ‚Äú <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581">Yandex</a> , for example, has to tie the salaries of key programmers working in Russia to the euro or the dollar and does not experience any benefits from the devaluation of the ruble,‚Äù continues Alexander Gerasimov, head of IT and cloud services at <a href="http://www.json.ru/">J'son &amp; Partners Consulting</a> . <br><br>  ‚ÄúOther companies pay Russian programmers in rubles,‚Äù <a href="http://pruffi.ru/">says</a> Alyona Vladimirskaya, head of the <a href="http://pruffi.ru/">Pruffi</a> recruiting agency. ‚ÄúThe idea is that now Russian offices would be very profitable for Western companies - our programmers, whom they value very much, are cheaper for companies than which, in the opinion of many of my clients, are not as highly valued.  But political reasons still outweigh the economic ones. ‚Äù <br><br>  For personnel reasons, the office in Tallinn opened the Russian <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallels">Parallels</a> .  ‚ÄúTallinn, for us, is primarily access to rare specialists in Russia: in Europe as a whole and in Estonia in particular, we are looking for project, program and product managers who have many years of experience in creating global products.  The best specialists are ready to move to Tallinn, but not to Moscow, that's the whole explanation, ‚ÄùNikolai Dobrovolsky, co-founder and vice president of PC virtualization at Parallels, <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2887855">told</a> Kommersant. <br><br>  Russia is now so unpopular with investors that even the very presence in the country negatively affects the cost of IT business.  ‚ÄúThose companies that I know are moving offices to other countries because now the central office in Russia does not have a very good effect on the capitalization of the business.  Regardless of the financial results, the value of a company with a Russian residence registration automatically decreases, and sales prospects are shrouded in mist, ‚Äùsays Alyona Vladimirskaya. <br><br><h4>  It‚Äôs not just the crisis that‚Äôs to blame </h4><br>  On December 14, Megamozg <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/22656/">wrote</a> that the CEO of Toshiba Rus LLC, Hiroaki Tezuka, stated that the restructuring of the company's business in Russia was completed.  In this case, this leads to the liquidation of the Russian division for the sale of televisions and kitchen appliances.  The Japanese corporation stopped sales of refrigerators and teapot thermos, deciding to focus on b2b contracts. <br><br>  The general director explains this decision by high competition and fluctuations in the ruble exchange rate.  In the TV segment, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung">Samsung</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Group">LG</a> were the largest competitors.  ‚ÄúIt was hard to work in this market, Korean companies have a market share of 70%,‚Äù said Tezuka. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.toshiba.ru/">Toshiba</a> accounted for up to 10% of the TV market.  Now only the Toshiba Rus b2b division, which cooperates with Russian Post, Sberbank and Power Machines, will remain.  Earlier it was also reported that Toshiba may completely abandon the production of televisions due to unprofitability.  It has already closed all TV production plants in Japan and is now considering selling overseas sites. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298030/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298030/</a></p>
