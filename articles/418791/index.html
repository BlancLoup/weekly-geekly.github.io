  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Oracles, or why smart contracts still have not changed the world?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For those who are interested in the topic of smart contracts, the answer to the question asked in the title lies on the surface: today, contracts do not have a reliable and complete source of information about what is happening in the real world.  As a result, there is a very bad situation: we can describe complex logic in a smart contract, and the blockchain will provide us with its unconditional execution.  And here, it would seem, we are a step away from eliminating the need for a third party to conclude contracts - this is what was meant by the words ‚Äúchange the world‚Äù in the title.  However, any logic that describes the processes of the real world, you need to know what is happening in this world.  Thus, the last obstacle separates us from the ‚Äúrevolution of trust‚Äù in the form of the lack of information providers or <i>oracles</i> , as they are called in the world of smart contracts.  The solution to this problem would give a tremendous impulse to the prevalence and applicability of smart contracts.  Otherwise, this technology risks forever remaining only a platform for the implementation of ICO. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jb/pq/i5/jbpqi5gccl28z4ywi5lxo86st8o.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Abilities that do not find use turn into nothing.</i> <br>  <i>Sten Nadolny</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Oracles </h4><br>  An oracle is a supplier of information that, upon request of a contract, provides reliable data from the <i>offline marketplace</i> for the correct operation of the contract.  The main requirements for the oracle - is the <b>accuracy</b> and <b>completeness</b> of the information provided.  Here, reliability means the ability to confirm / check the validity of the data, and fullness means the ability to provide data on a wide range of events from the real world.  We note separately that the oracle is not a source of information, it is its supplier to the <i>blockchain</i> .  Thus, the choice of the source of information is one of the key parameters of the oracle, because in order for the oracle to be reliable and complete, the source must also be reliable and complete (let's talk about the sources in the next section).

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qp/ux/ti/qpuxtimrmzkj0z7ym4ku1sz7xmy.jpeg" height="300"><br><br>  Let's start with the oracle credibility property.  To date, there are two main approaches to achieving the reliability of oracles.  The first is the <b>consensus of oracles</b> .  As the name suggests, this approach uses the consensus of several independent validators.  The main problem of this approach (from the point of view of reliability) is to create a network of independent validators.  On the one hand, if we choose / appoint consensus participants (oracles), they will be dependent on the selection / appointment mechanism.  Thus, centralization will remain, although, of course, to a lesser extent and in a different guise.  On the other hand, if anyone can become a participant in the consensus, the system becomes vulnerable to a <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">Sybil attack</a></i> .  In addition, there is an opinion that compromising (hacking, bribing) several small participants in a consensus may be easier than compromising a single major validator, since for a major player security measures are much more serious and reputational costs are much higher. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.oraclize.it/">Oraclize</a></b> provides an alternative to the oracles consensus solution: the user chooses the source of information on the Internet.  And to prove the correct operation of the oracle, <a href="https://tlsnotary.org/">TLSNotary-</a> proofs are used.  This is cryptographic evidence that the data obtained from the selected source is transferred to the smart contract unchanged. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d2/bi/br/d2bibr-en41kmqiyvwega_meej0.jpeg" height="320"><br><br>  At the moment, you can verify this evidence on the Internet using the <a href="http://app.oraclize.it/service/monitor">network monitor for Ethereum</a> (at the time of this writing, it is unstable).  In the future, it is planned to implement the possibility of verifying TLSNotary evidence directly by contract in the Ethereum network. <br><br>  It is important to note that both approaches have a problem of trusting the source / information of the information: both of them to some extent guarantee the integrity of the data from the source to the contract, but do not guarantee the integrity of the source (even if we chose it). <br><br><h4>  Information sources </h4><br>  At the beginning of this section we will touch on the topic of completeness of data provided by the oracle.  Achieving completeness means expanding the range of sources of information, and this entails even greater questions to the reliability of these data.  Consider two simple examples: if your contract needs information on the current ETH / USD rate, then you can consider large cryptocurrency exchanges as sources, the consensus of which will be fairly reliable.  And if the contract needs to know whether the lights are on in your bedroom, it will be extremely difficult to find independent eyewitnesses.  You can use a physical source, for example, a camera in the bedroom, but if you want, you can easily deceive it: put a bag on the camera and it will always be dark in your bedroom.  Thus, with an increase in the completeness of information provided by an oracle, the problem of searching for reliable sources becomes even more acute. <br><br>  The most natural source of information is <b>centralized</b> .  We are accustomed to this approach in everyday life: we will learn the news on our favorite site, the dollar rate - on the Central Bank‚Äôs site.  Most of us blindly believe these centralized sources, and this belief is most often justified, because the reputational costs for such large companies exceed the potential benefits that can be gained by giving you false information.  There are two "but."  First, authenticity: even when dealing with a reliable centralized source, we still operate with faith, not knowledge.  Secondly, and more importantly, completeness: the use of a centralized source can be considered a reliable approach only for a narrow circle of resonant events. <br><br>  The first way to get around the disadvantages of a centralized source is to use a <b>consensus source</b> .  We have already discussed this approach above when we talked about the consensus of oracles.  As in the case of oracles, this approach improves both the accuracy and completeness of the information provided, but its positive effect is limited and has its drawbacks (see the previous section). <br><br>  Another approach to solving the problem of information sources is an <b>indirect method</b> .  The idea is to extract information about the event of interest from indirect sources. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n_/wo/xo/n_woxozjz8uwgxufk1q9pjdfr-s.jpeg"><br><br>  These sources will be different for each type of event: for temperature in Moscow - a photo from an instagram with a corresponding geolocation and a date, for a match result - posts on social networks with corresponding tags and a date, etc.  The successes of recent years in the field of machine learning will probably allow us to determine the outcomes of past events with acceptable accuracy from indirect sources.  What machine learning models are applicable for this, what accuracy will be, whether indirect sources are independent - all these questions should be considered for each specific event separately, and the fact of their solvability will be a criterion for the applicability of the indirect method for this event. <br><br>  For relatively simple tasks, such as determining the result of a match from a sufficient sample of the posts of sports fans, these questions seem to be solved.  It is assumed that the contract will refer to the node on which the calculations are made (extracting the forecast from indirect sources).  The reliability of the calculations is proposed to confirm cryptographically, as implemented, for example, in the <a href="https://golem.network/">Golem</a> project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lo/27/m-/lo27m-iwvkfk_iiuz5fclf-pvby.jpeg" height="370"><br><br>  This approach is the second step towards the completeness of oracles.  This is not about the light in the bedroom, but about the weather, about the election results, about the success of the launch of the <a href="http://www.spacex.com/falcon-heavy">Falcon Heavy</a> . <br><br>  For a complete picture of the sources of information we will touch upon the subject <b>of prediction markets</b> such as <a href="https://www.augur.net/">Augur</a> .  The market uses the "wisdom of the crowd" to predict future events.  Users predict the possible outcome of these events by buying shares of remuneration for a correctly guessed result (the winners will divide the prize fund in proportion to the size of their rates).  Thus, this approach implies an economic motivation for the participants of the prediction: the user receives a reward for a correct prediction, and in the case of an incorrect one loses the invested funds.  The forecast in this case is the weighted average expectation of all users.  The use of prediction markets rather greatly increases the completeness of the information provided, because you can predict anything (if there are enough people), and the economic motivation of prediction participants provides credibility. <br><br>  However, not everything is as rosy as it may seem at first glance.  First, the prediction is only the expectation of market participants (many examples of events can be cited, the occurrence of which no one expected).  Secondly, in such a model, prediction manipulations are possible if the cost of changing the prediction to false is less than the profit from the incorrect operation of the contract.  For example, if a contract assumes a large payment in the event of event A, and the fact of the origin of this event determines the market of predictions with a small turnover of funds, then an attacker can falsify event A by spending only a fraction of the profit gained on manipulating the prediction. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  The importance of oracles for smart contract technology is hard to overestimate.  Oracle serves as a provider of information from the source to the contract.  And if the existing solutions today provide a fairly reliable transfer of this information, then the problem with its initial accuracy still remains unresolved.  The creation / selection of reliable and complete sources of information is the last frontier that separates smart contracts from ubiquitous distribution.  Given the active development of blockchain technologies, one can count on at least partially overcoming this milestone in the coming years. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418791/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418791/</a></p>
