And having completed, you experience joy and even happiness?  It means that you have experience of streaming states - special resource states of consciousness, when all attention is focused on the goal, and as a result wonderful ideas are born by themselves, and time concentrates, containing much more than in a normal state. <br>  The topic of efficiency of streaming states for work and creativity has already been raised several times on Habr√©, and in this article we want to discuss the practical part - what is needed in order to cause this state to be ‚Äúon order‚Äù? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For the first time, I thought about the effectiveness of flow conditions and how to call them arbitrarily, at the beginning of my teaching, when I discovered that when I conduct a lesson in a flow, the effect is significantly different from a lesson in a normal, everyday state.  This was noticeable both by the reaction of the participants and by my own self-awareness, which could be called the ‚ÄúState of the Master‚Äù.  Then I repeatedly ‚Äúcaught‚Äù this state at sports trainings, during programming, writing articles, dissertation, and developing trainings.  Analyzing what helped me to enter the streaming state, I derived for myself a certain formula, which, together with <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/antares19/" class="user_link">Antares19, we</a> deepened and supplemented, based on the works of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, training sessions of Marilyn Atkinson, as well as my own experience.

      The topic of streaming and resource states is very large.  There are many nuances, details and special cases, the material is enough for a good book.  In this small article, the most basic things are stated, the basic things - by sorting out with them, you can take a big step towards productive creative work. <br><br><h4>  Flow formula </h4><br><br>  In the process of creative experience, everyone finds his own ways of entering the stream, and these methods are individual, since the creative process is individual and unique in essence.  However, there are three basic resources underlying the emergence of any streaming state, these are Time, Information and Energy. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/87/5b/875b3916160794099ffbac0707d5ca3b.png"></a> <br><br>  In order to enter the streaming state, it is necessary to first invest each of the three resources in sufficient quality and quantity, and below we will look at some specific methods and techniques.  And then a stream effect of amplification and transformation of the invested resources arises, allowing to achieve high efficiency of activity in this state. <br>  Conventionally, this can be represented by the following formula: <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/62/c6/62c6de7638dbacd367e862518ce60e8d.png"></a> <br><br>  Let's take a consistent look at the features of each of the three resources, and how to use them to enter the stream. <br><br><h4>  Time </h4><br>  The first resource that is irreplaceable and therefore the most valuable is time. <br>  You can talk about the external time line and the internal, subjective time. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/88/8b/888b3722a7486119b060daf559766798.png"></a> <br><br>  <b>The external time line is</b> objective, measurable by instruments, linear, rigidly fixed by external events and other people.  When we are in close contact with the external time line, we closely monitor the time, plan, observe the schedule, correlate our own actions with external events.  This metaprogram is called ‚ÄúThrough Time‚Äù. <br>  <b>Internal time is</b> non-linear, measured subjectively.  When we enter a deep streaming state, we move from the external time line to the internal one (such a metaprogram is called ‚ÄúOn Time‚Äù, In Time).  All those who described their creative streaming state talked about the imperceptible flow of time in the stream.  Coming out of deep concentration, we can marvel at how much time has passed in the real world ‚Äî it can be many hours, but it can be minutes!  At the same time, the quantity and quality of work done in this state significantly exceeds the results of similar activities in a normal state.  Thus, if we talk about time resources, we get an increase in efficiency per unit time at the exit from the stream.  The stream saves our time, and we remember that time is an irreplaceable resource, therefore it is priceless! <br>  <b>How to work with time?</b> <br>  Let's start with the outer time line, on which we are in the normal state. <br>  First, make <b>time for it to be in the stream</b> .  At this time, do not plan any other cases, meetings.  Isolate your creative space from external stimuli for this time.  If you have tight time limiters, it is best to set an ‚Äúon exit‚Äù timer so that anxiety does not interfere with your concentration. <br>  Secondly, choose for yourself the <b>optimal strategy of interaction with time</b> in the stream. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e0/11/e0118784565faa518698dc82766bb1fd.PNG"></a> <br><br>  The third step is the <b>transition from the external time line to the internal</b> , but not the line anymore (after all, the subjective time is not linear), but the ‚ÄúNow and Here‚Äù point.  Do not remember past events, do not plunge into dreams of the future - fully immerse yourself in the present moment of creativity.  Be spontaneous in your thoughts, follow their non-linear course, do not limit yourself to the framework of past standards - you will be able to turn on the "critic" when you exit the stream. <br><br><h4>  Information </h4><br>  The second resource that needs to be prepared is Information.  This resource is directly related to your goal - what you want to get as a result of the streaming state. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/d8/8d/d88d88be18d120c7b329846032b5b99a.jpg"></a> <br>  Before entering the stream, at the entrance, <b>collect all the necessary information</b> .  If the level of complexity of the task exceeds your level of knowledge and skills at the current moment - go through training on this topic or select the part of the task that you can handle right now. <br>  <b>Break the task into steps</b> .  Answer the questions: <b>How will you measure your progress?</b>  How do you see that you succeed?  The visible presentation of immediate results is one of the important conditions for streaming activities. <br>  <b>Prepare tools and materials</b> that may be useful to you during the process.  You do not want to interrupt the creative state to look for a pencil sharpener? <br>  If we put enough effort ‚Äúat the entrance‚Äù, then in a state of flow we get clarity of consciousness, thoughts come by themselves, ‚Äúflow‚Äù, line up in the best way.  There are unexpected creative solutions, insights. <br>  At the exit, we get a high quality product of the activity containing our creative finds.  Often the result of our work is synchronicity - when the echoes of our ideas begin to appear in the outside world in the most unexpected situations. <br><br><h4>  Energy </h4><br>  The third and decisive resource is Energy.  To start a streaming state, an initial impulse, activation energy and motivation is necessary. <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/94/11/9411ed9a83aeb3378c285ad77acca3b1.jpg"></a> <br>  This initial impulse is formed, first of all, by the <b>intention</b> , our determination to act in achieving the goal. <br>  For this <b>purpose</b> , the <b>goal must be meaningful for us personally</b> .  If it is difficult to understand the immediate significance of this particular goal - consider goal after goal - what will be important for you that this happens? <br>  The next thing to do is add activation by action. <br><br>  <b>Divide your plan for achieving the goal into small parts and begin to carry out the plan with the most simple, easy, preparatory steps that lead to more complex.</b> <br>  The most important thing is to start acting!  And then the effect of a locomotive arises - it is very difficult to move it at the beginning, but if you apply enough effort and push it away, then it will roll along the rails itself, picking up speed.  And do not stop.  And it is here that the desired flow state arises, which carries us in the direction of our goal.  Usually, when the flow is already running, the level of our energy and strength exceeds the level of everyday life, we can do more and our skill level also increases. <br>  At the exit, we feel energized.  Despite the intense work, we do not feel exhausted, can only mild pleasant fatigue or even a surge of strength and emotional lift. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  So, briefly present the basic three steps for creating a Flow: <br><br><ol><li>  Specially arrange Time. </li><li>  Prepare all the necessary information. </li><li>  Invest Energy: set the initial impulse, act! </li></ol><br>  Of course, each of the steps has many nuances and can be implemented using various techniques that are best chosen individually, taking into account its own characteristics. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a3/da/a3dafb7cd3daa87178943ef8256569ff.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Illustrations Kung Fu Panda (C) DreamWorks Animation <br><br>  <b>upd:</b> the article added a clarification of what is meant by ‚Äústarting work with simple steps‚Äù in order to avoid ambiguity in understanding.  Thank you VitaZheltyakov for the addition. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117176/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117176/</a></p>
