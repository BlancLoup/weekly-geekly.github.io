You accept parcels, pack them and send them.  But behind this external simplicity, as behind the tip of the iceberg, there are numerous and rather complex processes, and the coordinated work of a fairly large team. <br><br>  We talk about the difficulties in the work of <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru%3F_openstat%3DR2Vla1RpbWVzO0dhZGdldHNfMjAxNjtQb3N0XzE7">"Parcel Post"</a> , which can be divided into several categories. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Security: no carders!</font> </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25f/4f0/1df/25f4f01df4ef45df84218f595b8e82b5.jpg"></div><br>  Shopping on the Internet is made not only by bona fide customers, but also by fraudsters.  We call them the collective term carders.

      Carders use stolen credit cards or other means of payment obtained by illegal means and make purchases in online stores with their help in order to ‚Äúcash‚Äù the stolen funds through a chain of intermediaries. <br><br>  This is a serious problem for mailforwarders: if goods purchased with stolen money come to your warehouse and you send it to attackers, then representatives of the law may come and demand clarification.  Therefore, if you just look at the actions of such fraudsters through the fingers, then the mail forwarder at one point may turn in the eyes of the law from an observer into an accomplice. <br><br>  Banderolka actively struggling with carders and other scammers.  A whole security department is involved in this, and to identify Internet fraudsters, we have developed a <a href="http://anticarder.com/">special service</a> that helps detect and block carders. <br><br>  When we discover a card, we close his account permanently, return purchases in his name to stores, and accepted money (if he has enough time to replenish the balance before we block him) - back to the card from which the payment came. <br><br>  This policy does not like the attackers, because because of this, they lose money that they have just honestly stolen.  Therefore, the Banderolkin site was repeatedly subjected to serious DDoS attacks.  Fortunately, we have learned to fight with them, now they do not bother us at all. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Technical difficulties: DIY</font> </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22a/fa5/7f3/22afa57f344447f78edf5d7ea11183bd.jpg"></div><br>  As long as the mail forwarder is small and handles several dozen, maximum, hundreds of incoming parcels per day, it can afford to keep records and control orders ‚Äúon the knee.‚Äù  Particularly advanced use typical solutions for warehouse management.  But if your parcels account for thousands, such mechanisms, obeying the law of large numbers, begin to falter.  Incoming parcels may inadvertently end up in someone else‚Äôs account, operators may simply ‚Äúforget‚Äù about some orders, in some cases the parcel may simply be lost in the depths of the warehouse. <br><br>  The parcel turned into such a ‚Äúchildish‚Äù period quite a long time ago, and we quickly realized that in order for the warehouse to work quickly, reliably and without failures, we need an advanced warehouse automation system.  We started with ‚Äúadult‚Äù warehouse software, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, but after a while we came to the conclusion that it does not provide the efficiency we need, just because it was ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù to manage large quantities of commercial cargo. <br><br>  Therefore, we have developed our own warehouse management system, which is not so large and universal, but it is ideally suited precisely for our tasks.  A separate team of programmers is working on improving it every day.  Thanks to it, the warehouse works like a clock, and all processes are automated as much as possible and equipped with accounting and control systems.  The influence of the human factor is minimized, and the probability of any error is extremely small. <br><br>  Not all mail forwarders chose this path.  Some of our colleagues, even with a sufficiently large flow of orders, continue to process them in a semi-manual mode, which, unfortunately, affects the quality and speed of service, and this, in turn, is immediately expressed in public indignation of customers. <br><br>  Realizing that developing our own warehouse software is very complicated and expensive, we decided to help our colleagues and developed a cloud version of our warehouse management system - <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru/wholesale%3F_openstat%3DR2Vla1RpbWVzO0dhZGdldHNfMjAxNjtQb3N0XzE7">Qwintry Fulfillment</a> .  Thanks to her, any mail forwarder can use our know-how and technology without any investment.  Such decisions allow you to make the market better, and customers - happier! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Difficulties with shopping in foreign stores</font> </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60b/2be/1de/60b2be1de65d4cdb80ba800271ac9b75.jpg"></div><br>  Despite the fact that buying in American stores in 90% of cases is easy and simple, sometimes customers have difficulty.  Causes of difficulties may be different.  For example, some stores do not accept payments by foreign bank cards or refuse to send goods to mailforward addresses.  The seller may need to clarify the details of the order, and then the difficulty may be the language barrier. <br><br>  To solve all these problems, Banderolk launched a separate service - <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru/shopping-help%3F_openstat%3DR2Vla1RpbWVzO0dhZGdldHNfMjAxNjtQb3N0XzE7">Help With Purchase</a> .  It is available from your personal account on the Banderolka website, as well as as a convenient extension for Google Chrome.  When you use this service, you only need to select a product and send a link to it to the staff of the Parcel Post who take care of all the shopping issues. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Not only complexity!</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/877/060/d47/877060d47af646aeb0d2ede26e094c55.png"><br><br>  Of course, we are coping with all the difficulties, and it is very interesting to look for non-trivial solutions to the problems that arise.  And such solutions primarily concern customers. <br><br>  Therefore, now we are having the action of the <a href="https://qwintry.com/landing/2016-gadget/%3F_openstat%3DR2Vla1RpbWVzO0dhZGdldHNfMjAxNjtQb3N0XzE7">‚ÄúGadget Banderol‚Äù</a> , under which we have reduced the prices for the delivery of devices. <br><br><ul><li>  Deliver watches, fitness trackers and earbud headphones for $ 10 </li><li>  Delivery of smartphones and large headphones will cost you $ 15 </li><li>  Tablets and action cameras will come to your home for $ 20 </li></ul><br>  A nice bonus is that in the package with a smartphone or tablet, you can put a cover for them - the price of delivery will not increase. <br><br>  If you do not live in Russia and do not fall under the action of the action - do not worry!  For Belarus and Kazakhstan, the usual delivery of 1 kg of a parcel by our own Qwintry Air service costs only $ 25, so it is still profitable to buy and deliver the equipment together with the <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru%3F_openstat%3DR2Vla1RpbWVzO0dhZGdldHNfMjAxNjtQb3N0XzE7">‚ÄúBanderolka‚Äù</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372349/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372349/</a></p>
