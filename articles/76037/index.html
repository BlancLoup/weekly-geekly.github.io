The Constitution states that <i>‚Äúa person, his life, health, honor and dignity, integrity and security in Ukraine are considered the highest social value‚Äù</i> (Article 27) and enshrines the right of everyone to <i>‚Äúprotect their lives and the health of others from unlawful encroachments‚Äù</i> (Art. 27).  According to the Constitution, <i>‚Äúcitizens have equal constitutional rights and freedoms and are equal before the law‚Äù</i> (Article 24).

      The Criminal Code of Ukraine establishes the concept, nature and characteristics of necessary defense as circumstances precluding the criminality of an act (Article 36), securing constitutional rights and excluding criminal responsibility in the case of adequate self-defense of a citizen against unlawful encroachments. <br><br>  The declarative norms sound beautiful and encouraging, but this is where all their beneficial effects unfortunately end. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Even one of the key law enforcement agencies, namely the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, violates the constitutional rights of its citizens.  What is the secret order of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine No. 379 - DSP, which, firstly, violates the citizens' right to information, and secondly, discriminates them on the basis of certain "features", dividing everyone into "mere mortals" and "special categories of citizens ".  There is nothing secret in the order of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine No. 379, except for the list of persons eligible to acquire traumatic weapons.  So why is he already under the chipboard !? <br><br>  We will not speak about the right of law enforcement officers to the means of active defense (traumatic weapon), they have a long-term service and they cannot argue with that.  The same can be said of the military, they also live is not sweet. <br><br>  And now let's understand what we, ‚Äúmere mortals,‚Äù are different from the same mortals, who are ‚Äúspecial‚Äù !? <br><br>  <b>Special category ‚Ññ1.</b>  <u>People's Deputy of Ukraine</u> .  These are special people, such as we have as many as 450 people.  White bone, "elite" - how can they forbid something, because they themselves write the laws !?  True, in 10 years, the Law on Weapons could not be adopted, thereby giving rise to a multitude of ‚Äúholes‚Äù in the legislation and abuses by ‚Äúperpetrators‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Special category ‚Ññ2.</b>  <u>Civil servants</u> with categories and ranks are at least department heads, i.e.  clearly not ordinary citizens.  They became "special" because  this is required by ‚Äúcorporate ethics‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Special category number 3.</b>  <u>Journalists.</u>  Usually the people are simple and quite intelligent.  They have nothing in common with the first two categories, except for one BUT!  All ‚Äúspecial‚Äù categories, like any of us, belong to the genus ‚ÄúHomo sapiens‚Äù, with all the ensuing consequences.  The trick taking into account the psychology of people in action.  "If it is possible for me, but it is impossible for others, it means that I can always explain in a motivated way that this is correct."  Therefore, the press is silent and the very notion of a ‚Äúspecial category‚Äù among journalists usually does not evoke disgust or indignation.  After all, how nice to be "special"! <br><br>  <b>Special category ‚Ññ4.</b>  <u>Members of public formations for the protection of public order and the state border.</u>  It is necessary, as it is to live, and there are a lot of those who want to get permission to purchase among those who are not so ‚Äúspecial‚Äù.  That left a loophole just in case, suddenly come in handy. <br><br>  Thus, almost everyone who could somehow influence the decision to grant the people of Ukraine the right to self-defense with a traumatic weapon in their hands is ‚Äúsmeared‚Äù (they are ‚Äúspecial‚Äù) and will prove with foaming at the mouth that they cannot be given weapons to the people.  Their motivation is zero.  In addition, we should not forget that the deputies do not have serious grounds for lobbying for the adoption of the Law of Ukraine ‚ÄúOn Weapons‚Äù.  The largest plant for the production of traumatic weapons has not yet been privatized, and it is not customary to defend the state interests of deputies. <br><br>  <b>Summarize.</b> <br><br>  What do we, simple, law-abiding and respectable citizens have in the end?  What are our chances to achieve the right to self-defense, at least with a traumatic weapon in our hands !?  The answer is simple - there are NO chances, rights are NOT GETTING, save money and become ‚ÄúSPECIAL‚Äù if you want! <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <a href="http://www.travmatik.com/2009/11/oformlenie-razresheniya-na-travmaticheskij-pistolet-specsredstvo-v-ukraine/">Registration of permission for a traumatic gun, special equipment in Ukraine</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76037/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76037/</a></p>
