  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Urbanized jungle or non-intellectual intelligence</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I think everyone has seen at least once a dog crossing the road at the traffic lights according to all the ‚Äúhuman‚Äù rules?  I often see such pictures in the center of the city, when one dog or a group of dogs waits for the green light of a traffic light and only after it lights up - crosses the road.  For those who believe that dogs do not distinguish colors, we will assume that they are not waiting for green, but for low light - the essence of the matter here does not change. <br>  Also, I often had to ride in an elevator with cats that enter the elevator and ride with people until they arrive at their floor. <br>  But yesterday I saw something new.  The dog got into the tram, walked through the cabin, found an empty seat and lay down under it, so as not to disturb anyone.  Judging by her appearance - she obviously grew up on the street and does not know what comb and shampoo are, and even more so what is dressura.  So here.  This dog drove about five stops and when she heard the announcement of its stop, and the stops in the tram are announced by a voice synthesizer with a sufficiently clear diction, got up, went to the exit, observing the line and left.  When people were touched, they began to discuss what they saw, the conductor said: ‚ÄúAnd she always arrives at this time on Fridays, there is a stall with shawarma, and so on Fridays, before closing, they clean the dishes and throw away unspent meat‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When I see such a picture, I once again think about the nature of intelligence. <br><br>  What Wikipedia tells us about intelligence: <br>  <i><b>Intellect</b> (from the Latin. Intellectus - understanding, cognition) - the system of all the cognitive abilities of the individual: sensation, perception, memory, representation, thinking, imagination.</i>  <i>General ability to learn and solve problems, which determines the success of any activity and underlies other abilities.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>At present, intelligence refers to the ability to carry out the process of cognition and to effectively solve problems, in particular when mastering a new circle of life tasks.</i> <br><br>  And so, we will sort on points:

      1. <b>Ability to carry out the process of knowledge.</b> <br>  The process of knowledge is so-called.  learning without a teacher.  Those.  the ability to learn the world on your own, to find patterns and extract facts from what is happening, making useful conclusions for yourself. <br><br>  2. <b>Ability to effectively solve problems.</b> <br>  This ability characterizes an object (organism) that is able to solve the tasks set for it in the most rational way, applying the tools currently available to it. <br><br>  3. <b>Ability to master new tasks.</b> <br>  An intellectual object (whether it is an organism, a device, or a program) must independently solve new tasks that it sets for itself, independently adapt to changes in the environment and master new tools. <br><br>  What we, developers of artificial intelligence systems, are always kicking for, is that such a system, being trained in one solution space, is often completely useless if the space of the tasks assigned to it changes significantly.  Such systems, in particular, resemble trained dogs, or, forgive me, my employees, 90% of employees.  Such people, having received education and having come to work, get at their disposal a range of tasks, a set of tools and the space of the required solutions, often accompanied by a teacher.  If such an employee has worked for several years in one position, then he will be of little use in another, he will again need a teacher and time to master the assigned tasks.  Such mastering can be called an intellectual process only if it happens on its own, otherwise it is just dressing. <br><br>  So does the above dog have intelligence?  Does she have the above three abilities.  I believe that yes, it does.  She herself learned how to use the tram as a means of transportation, independently remembered how her stop was called (even if you didn‚Äôt understand the words, but do we understand all the words we use?), Learned to come and go so as not to stay with people paws.  And all this in order to once a week eat the remnants of meat for shawarma.  There is one more thing - she shares the days of the week.  Suppose she does not know that today is Friday, and she doesn‚Äôt need it, but then she knows for sure that today she‚Äôs going to sleep well. <br><br>  And so, is an organism responding adequately to changes in the environment and independently finding the optimal solution to the task set for it, an intellectual one? <br>  If we are talking about a person - they call him clever, sharp-witted, erudite. <br>  If we are talking about the program - it is called with loud words "artificial intelligence". <br>  But now, when it comes to our smaller brothers, skeptics begin to tell us about instincts and dressage. <br><br>  Or maybe it is worth shifting the emphasis?  We are with you all the same intellectual creation.  Maybe we should admit that just as you and I can adapt and survive in the jungle of nature, our smaller brothers adapt and survive in our urbanized jungle, thus manifesting the very thing that we call a loud word ‚Äúintellect‚Äù? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64475/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64475/</a></p>
