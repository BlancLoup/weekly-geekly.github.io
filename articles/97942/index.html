Business cards left over from previous activities.  On business cards it is written: Ilya Alexandrov, director of the design laboratory ‚ÄúPixel‚Äù.  I think that there are quite a lot of people in Habr√© who are involved in the creation of sites: designers, programmers, managers.  Someone is now engaged in creating his own studio.  I decided to leave the site building more patient. <a name="habracut"></a>  (this decision concerns me personally, not the studio. The latter continues to work successfully) <br><br>  The web-studio works in the B2B sector (business-to-business), which leaves a strong imprint on the specifics of the work.  I think you should not dwell on the problems that face the developers, you all know them well.  In no way could I reconcile myself with the fact that a competently executed work of a team that knows its business can suddenly kill the self-motivated deputy director of the N plant and not even explain the reasons.

      After a bit of thought, I turned my gaze towards the B2C sector (business-to-consumer).  Having experience in the development of projects, I did not hope that it would be easier, but it was interesting to try.  The main hope was that a large mass of people (consumers) are more objective and the system itself is more transparent: if your product / idea / service is good and demanded, they are bought (not without promotion, of course).  No - think further. <br><br>  In the new project I had the opportunity to apply the knowledge that I gained during the development of the web studio.  Make them work on your project.  This is a very important motivating factor.  By this time I had already tried my hand at the modest project <a href="http://sumkins.ru/">‚ÄúSumkins‚Äù</a> , which I did for my wife.  And I understood: working with the consumer is real and even pleasant. <br><br>  Now, with my usual partner <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/soratnik/" class="user_link">Soratnik</a> , we needed an idea for the project.  All kinds of ‚Äúlists / ratings / blogs / social networks‚Äù projects were dismissed immediately, it was worth looking at the lists of recent startups.  Formed requirements for the project: <br><ul><li>  B2C </li><li>  transparent monetization </li><li>  at least minimal novelty </li><li>  interest for ourselves </li><li>  Internet sales </li><li>  opportunities for expansion </li><li>  niche vacancy </li></ul><br>  And here the case provided us with a young mother.  A friend asked for help to make a small video (video card) with her five-year-old son.  Here it is! <br>  Of course, we knew about the existence of services that put a photo of a person in a video.  But they decided to dig deeper and aim it at a full-fledged cartoon, the main character of which will be a real child.  Cartoon in the best traditions to carry good and good. <br><br>  This is how <a href="http://tvoymult.ru/">‚ÄúYour Mult‚Äù appeared</a> <br><br>  Immediately decided that taking the existing cartoons and substitute the photo is not our option (there are examples on the web).  Cartoon created themselves.  Gathering a team of contacts gained over the years in the studio.  For me it was a very interesting and difficult work - to direct a full-fledged cartoon (albeit a short one). <br>  In parallel with the creation of the cartoon created the site and content for it.  Then they thought over the technology of fast and simple rendering of the cartoon.  All it took a little less than six months. <br>  To make our product more ‚Äúmaterial‚Äù, look more like a gift and cause more emotions, we wrapped it in a DVD. <br><br>  <b>About the results:</b> this week we sold 12 discs and 1 video file. <br><br>  The project is interesting because it is scalable.  Already a lot of ideas.  New cartoons, new personalization technologies, new marketing chips and more.  Now we are launching an affiliate program. <br><br>  So I moved from working with managers in <b>jackets</b> to mothers in <b>lab coats</b> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97942/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97942/</a></p>
