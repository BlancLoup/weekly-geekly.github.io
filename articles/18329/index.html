  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chance for alternative OS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Various analysts are constantly expressing opinions <sup><a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18329/">1</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18329/">2</a></sup> that the next few years will be decisive in the struggle of operating systems for a place in the sun, more precisely, for the desktop market ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/linux/30933.html">this post</a> can be read about the corporate sector).  Indeed, at the beginning of this year, a new version of Windows Vista was released, which took about five years to develop.  More recently, the latest version of Mac OS X Leopard, which is also fighting for users, is true in its market segment (on the other hand, there are fewer problems with support for hardware and various software).  In addition, Linux distributions have been released, but this is not a remarkable phenomenon, since most of them have a stable and predictable release cycle. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Thus, the main event was exactly the long-awaited release of whists, which nevertheless did not quite meet the expectations of users (and apparently the creators).  As for sales, whist seems to be breaking records, but one should take into account both the aggressive marketing policy of Microsoft and the increased fleet of computers in general.  Despite this, both corporate and regular users continue to work with the old version of Windows XP.  After all, to install a new OS you usually have to buy a new computer or upgrade your old one strongly.  On the other hand, it is worth remembering that Windows XP was also not at first positively perceived by either professionals or users, but then many called it ‚Äúthe best Windows‚Äù.  However, Windows Vista has a number of problems: <br><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Windows_Vista">Why criticize Windows Vista?</a> <br><ul><li>  High iron requirements </li><li>  Poor performance </li><li>  High cost and inconvenient licensing scheme </li><li>  DRM </li><li>  Unfinished security system </li></ul><br><br><br><h2>  Chance for Linux: 2008-2010 </h2><br>  Another drawback is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_new_to_Windows_Vista">number of features</a> that were not included in the final version, for example, the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winfs">WinFS</a> file system (it has actually been developed since the beginning of the 90s from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_%2528operating_system%2529">Cairo</a> project), and which are likely to be included in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7">seventh version of Windows</a> .  This version, codenamed Vienna, is due out by 2010.  That is, alternative operating systems have two years, during which it is necessary to prepare a full-fledged desktop distribution (or several distributions).  Of course, the developers of other systems can also take advantage of this opportunity, it would be fun if Apple officially released a MacOS for PC, albeit with limited hardware support (I wonder if Ballmer said?), Although they have their own development strategy.

    <h2>  Challengers to the throne </h2><br>  The first contender who can press Windows has become one of the <a href="http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php%3Fresource%3Dmajor">most popular distributions</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_%2528Linux_distribution%2529">Ubuntu</a> .  The fact is that in 2008 the version of Ubuntu 8.04 comes out with a long support period (until 2011 for desktops, and 2013 - for servers), which is very important for both ordinary and corporate users.  Another advantage for Ubuntu will be the release of the new version of Debian, on which it is based. <br>  The second contender according to DistroWatch should be considered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSUSE">openSUSE</a> , which is sponsored by Novell.  Attitudes toward this operating system are, frankly, different - from admiration (from corporate clients) to complete rejection (especially among Open Source fans who have a negative attitude towards cooperation between Novell and Microsoft). <br>  The third is the finish of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_%2528Linux_distribution%2529">Fedora</a> distribution, supported by Red Hat, which also finds support in the corporate market just like openSUSE. <br>  Outside the three leaders undeservedly left a good desktop distribution <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandriva_Linux">Mandriva</a> , which is also very popular.  I certainly can‚Äôt list all the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Linux_distributions">Linux distributions</a> , but I tried to choose the most appropriate ones for use on the desktop computer of the average user. <br><br><br><h2>  Retinue of applicants </h2><br>  As you know, the retinue makes the king, and the program "make" the OS.  After all, now the operating system is not a bare core and a set of basic utilities, but a full-fledged workplace with a full set of programs, of course, with the exception of highly specialized ones.  In fact, the kernel and utilities are the first layer of the required software, which is called GNU / Linux.  The second layer is the Desktop environment (‚Äúdesktop environment‚Äù), which is not only a GUI, but also a set of additional programs, including basic office software. <br>  For Linux, there are two main DE - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME">GNOME</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE">KDE</a> .  First, a few words about sneakers, because the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE_4">fourth version is</a> coming soon with very serious changes that will affect not only the user interface, but also a set of programs.  The dwarf in this case lags behind the sneakers (he has a philosophy of gradually developing, without jerking), and in March next year we are promised to release <a href="http://live.gnome.org/RoadMap/">version 2.22</a> .  As for the other "desktops", it is worth noting another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce">Xfce</a> , because it can be used on weak machines. <br>  The third layer of software - will be office applications, browsers and multimedia, which are not included in the DE software suite.  Let's stop, only on the main ones.  The recognized leader in the open source office suite market is OpenOffice.org.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koffice">Other</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnome_office">packages</a> remain very strong.  As for competition with the office suite from Microsoft, the situation is not in favor of the open source package, although their functionality <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_office_suites">does not differ much</a> . <br>  I will also pay attention to browsers - after all, in this market competition is one of the most fierce.  Everyone expects the release of the third version of the browser Fifefox, which will compete with the seventh version of Internet Explorer.  Of course, it is worth noting the upcoming release of Opera and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webkit">WebKit</a> framework gaining weight. <br><br><br><h2>  Iron </h2><br>  Support for a growing number of different hardware will be able to have a very positive effect on the prevalence of Linux.  In the desktop sector, the situation is improving, with the drivers being developed by the manufacturers themselves, though not always revealing the code and specifications of the product.  The most rapidly changing situation is in the video card market (and, accordingly, the gaming market), where manufacturers gradually realize the importance of the Linux platform. <br>  In 2007, three major assemblers of computers, Dell, Lenovo and HP, announced that they would supply computers with a pre-installed Linux (each company chose its own distribution). <br><br><h2>  Vindekapets? </h2><br>  Certainly not.  In the market of desktop computers Windows in the medium term (2008-2015) will be the most popular operating system.  At the moment, the presence of operating systems based on GNU / Linux fluctuates around one percent depending on the country.  With this operating system, they will start to reckon when it can occupy at least 10 percent of the market, because it can already be completely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Windows_and_Linux">compared</a> with Windows in terms of functionality.  <strong>In fact, in the next few years, alternative operating systems may take up some of the market.</strong> <br>  So, we wish that the next two years we will see a competitive (including in terms of marketing and interaction with computer builders) release of the Linux distribution, because in any case we will benefit from the competition - users. <br><br><br><h2>  Links </h2><br><ul><li>  The article contains many links to the English Wikipedia - they are mainly for obtaining basic information, and will not be of interest to the professional. </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/linux/30455.html">2008 could be a breakthrough year for Linux</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20071115/122052.shtml">Will 2008 Be The Year Of The Linux Desktop?</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/linux/33433.html">Latest KDE4 News</a> </li></ul><br><br><h2>  PS </h2><br>  Without holivars, please, this is only a forecast, and not a question of which OS is better. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18329/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18329/</a></p>
