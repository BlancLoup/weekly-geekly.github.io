In 2001, he received an MBA degree at the University of Antwerp in Belgium, and two years later, in 2003, he joined the board of the Agrico investment corporation.  Until 2012, when Pay-Me was founded, Vladimir gained valuable experience in the development of large innovative projects by creating his own companies AeroSolutions, Optiflame Solutions and TeleChip. <br><br>  The history of <a href="https://pay-me.ru/">Pay-Me is</a> also rich: in 2012, the company launched a project in Russia in partnership with Visa, Alfa-Bank and Beeline and conducted the first transaction with a magnetic reader.

There are colossal examples in the IT business, I‚Äôm not even talking about facebook, and so on.  I‚Äôm talking about Russian people who, with hard work and a little bit of luck, you know, ‚Äúwater wears away a stone,‚Äù and investors find you, don‚Äôt you run after them day after day, but they come and say: ‚ÄúAnd take my money, and let us we invest. "  There are a million such examples.  Although the past few years, the opposite story: a million projects, invented from the ceiling, it seems to me that I will now do Vkontakte 33.0, and everything will be fine.  Many are very fictional, but they quickly bend themselves, and it is scary that they appear. </blockquote><br><h4>  Just do it </h4><blockquote>  Do not be afraid!  If you decide to start a project, take it and do it.  Only your own experience will teach you and give you much more knowledge than a hundred books read and advice heard.  I have a 10-year entrepreneurial experience, but, like the first launch of my project, I sometimes continue to make mistakes.  The main thing is to draw conclusions from the experience gained, to constantly learn and continue to go towards your goal. </blockquote><br><h4>  Try, try, try! </h4><br><blockquote>  All successful startups that I know of were never made by teenagers, but made by people who worked in large companies, looked at how corporations are spinning, and with the pluses and minuses of these corporations, and worked in small companies, and even startups hired workers, and then left and did their own.  And therefore, as my professor said, you need to twitch, move and move, that is, "there is no water flowing under a lying stone." </blockquote><br><h4>  Create the right environment </h4><blockquote>  In a startup, it is very important to create a prototype of a product in a short time, then a product, then the best product.  Your task is to assemble the involved and compact team, clearly define the directions of the efforts and not interfere.  4-5 strong and motivated developers in the same room can make a competitive product in a very short time. </blockquote><br><h4>  Set priorities </h4><blockquote>  When you work on your project, you have a lot of ideas, you want to implement them all, but you need to choose.  Of course, this does not cancel experiments, but always remember about the costs of them and do not deviate from the main line. </blockquote>  <b>And most importantly - learn to make decisions and take responsibility!</b> <br><br>  <i>Editorial note: if you have a desire to participate in the ‚ÄúFounder‚Äôs Tips‚Äù section, write to us at editor (at) megamozg.ru</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292180/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292180/</a></p>
