      The camp where the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/234881/">finalist of Google Code Jam holds a poker tournament</a> where instead of discos the guys go to complete programming tasks in olympiad programming where everyone could print anything on a 3d printer (of course we didn‚Äôt print the gun, only drew in Photoshop), where children co-authored articles on Habr√© and taught even younger children robotics, a camp where even a sports athlete sportorg is a student of MIPT, where the robot is called ‚ÄúMasechka‚Äù and joke about the fact that ‚Äúin the Belgorod region there is so much ore will not be enough".  Here, counselors read Filipino tales before bedtime, and the participants call the doctor a support. <br><br>  On Habr√© there are several reports on educational events that I was interested in reading ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/231191/">1</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/makeitlab/blog/221343/">2</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/214225/">3</a> ), but I know that a lot of things remain inaccessible to the general public (for example, mega-interesting projects of the Secondary Secondary School and KLSh).  I want to encourage this publication with a) those who participate in the organization of steep educational programs - write about this b) habrazhiteli - participate in / organize camps / training programs. <br><br>  Under the cat, the adventures of a 3d printer in the camp, a little about the "engineering Olympiad" and robotics. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  The adventures of a 3d printer in an educational camp </h4><br>  At TED, there is a story about how a computer was built into the wall in Africa and left to be torn apart by children and they very quickly mastered it - they recorded audio and went online.  I decided to repeat the experiment only with a 3d printer in Russia. <br><br>  I put the box in the center of the room and said that you can sort it out yourself and do anything under my supervision.  The most curious quickly installed software and drivers and with the slogan "Manual for wimps" in an hour were ready to print the first model. <br>  But I gave them an additional quest - to find out why the slicer did not start on my 8-ke.  And we figured it out.  But then began the western. <br><br>  Each mistake was a stepping stone to understanding how a 3d printer works (including me). <br><br>  At first we used the printer as an engraver.  The guys and I enjoyed the sounds with which brass draws a circle on the surface of aluminum and shades it.  Looks like during transportation the platform got loose.  2 minutes - and we screwed it right.  But it turned out that the printer refuses to squeeze out the plastic.  Read the entire manual.  Helped about what could be wrong.  We decided to disassemble and see what is inside.  It seems all the lights are on.  People made a selfie on the background of the disassembled printer and sent to instagrammer.  At the same time, I disassembled the extruder and we discussed the reduction factor and the principles of operation of the stepping motors.  It turned out that the nozzle was clogged with aluminum chips.  Changed, following the exact instructions in the manual.  Plastic went. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0de/d1a/e8e/0ded1ae8e25a41a7a402d7ea5f1dbaa5.jpg"><br>  4 controllers.  It is clear that one for each coordinate, why the 4th? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8bb/2b6/81f/8bb2b681ff0e42acbae933bede2f882a.jpg"><br>  We hypothesize what could happen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c51/ebc/c37/c51ebcc37c2b472b9733dac8847b2ee3.jpg"><br>  Lecture on 3d printing (history of 3d printers from 1984 to the present day, achievements of 3d printing in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169437/">2012</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/208042/">2013</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/227961/">metal</a> and stereolithographic printers).  We discussed why nano-photos are black and white and how to print in space (without support?) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb7/2c0/7b6/eb72c07b62d0409883d89c9e4ebed117.jpg"><br>  We printed the planetary bearing, but he refused to rotate.  We had a road bike lying around and this was the solution that the young engineers offered.  The bearing began to rotate, only the central gear melted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/850/9c7/df5/8509c7df5f124929a1c4d732774434f9.jpg"><br>  Some girls check out bracelets with hearts, and some - shell gears. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48a/064/da2/48a064da2eb2412e82cf7856a28e422f.jpg"><br>  Hit of the season - <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%2590%25D0%25A0%25D0%2594%25D0%2598%25D0%25A1">TARDIS</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b1/eee/1d7/9b1eee1d768d4063872445f6a5b34381.jpg"><br>  For an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/233545/">article on Habr√©</a> , a business card of Kevin Mitnick was printed. <br><br><h5>  Semi-Nut </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5cf/7f0/0fd/5cf7f00fdcbe4bd687e478ed050198d0.jpg"><br>  For space successes, the guys received / will receive seven-sided nuts.  (For reworking a 6-point nut, OpenSCAD is very convenient) <br><blockquote>  module hex_head (hg, df) <br>  { <br>  cylinder (h = hg, r = df / 2 / sin (360/7), $ fn = 7, center = false); <br>  } </blockquote><br><br><h5>  Barrel </h5><br>  For a ‚Äúgardener / broomstick‚Äù on a 3d printer, we printed out a reservoir that we had previously drawn in SketchUp. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/885/cbf/ee2/885cbfee2bc04ca68a9e162e929db159.jpg"><br><br>  There are two small round holes in the lid for sonar.  To measure the water level. <br>  Black wire for pump inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d1/164/8b9/4d11648b98364673bdf8d3729ca5f259.jpg"><br>  Debugging the robot gardener. <br><br>  How to make the walls of the tank waterproof, we figured out (put the layer thickness of 20% of the thickness of the nozzle), but the second problem arose. <br><br>  How to make the bottom of the tank waterproof?  The guys and I did not find an answer to this question, so we used the waterproof bag-type tab.  Printer manufacturers then suggested the direction of the search - to increase the flow rate of plastic. <br><br><h5>  Rubik's Cube </h5><br>  For the project to create a robot that collects the Rubik's cube, we needed adapters.  They were drawn in Blender and sent to print. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d1/c82/2ed/8d1c822ed3554169b90d1cb8e0ab300e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87c/83d/806/87c83d806a224acc9c6163a26da9e7a9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfe/0ba/1f6/cfe0ba1f6d964e449f918950be10f12e.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Spiderman </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e48/40d/93b/e4840d93bd3f4c7485fa2f4d3bc7661b.jpg"><br>  A 3d printer was useful for making paws for spider robots.  Forgive us arachnologists and paleoarachnologists for 6 and 4 paw "spiders". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f4f/a40/ae5/f4fa40ae5dd34b48a3bc43322e76d63a.jpg"><br>  As planned, the robot should collect the parts from Lego around the room and look for socks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c81/82d/137/c8182d137341490dbec6793f46a56d0f.jpg"><br>  Funny name - ‚Äúrobot chicken‚Äù.  (And there was also a politically correct name ‚Äúrobot crab‚Äù). <br><br>  <b>Total on a 3d printer:</b> mastered Blender, SketchUp, OpenSCAD and Photoshop (with 3d printing support) for creating / adjusting models, Thingiverse for downloading / uploading models, Slic3r and Repetier-Host for managing a 3d printer.  Disassembled the printer and extruder, diagnosed faults. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb2/97a/106/cb297a106ee144f38aac91a464391bf3.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The percentage of interested of the total</b> <br>  In total, there were 60+ people in the camp in three groups: robotics, Olympiad programming, and application development.  Most of all interested were from robotics.  5-6 people showed very active interest, another 5-6 showed high interest, 10 people had average interest, the rest are indifferent (against the background of high employment in their projects). <br><br>  Those who are even interested in organizing a mini-lecture to their parents who came to visit. <br>  The guys also offered to make a robot from a 3d printer so that he himself could come / fly in / crawl / jump in / roll in to his shop makers and talk about what had happened to him. <br><br>  <b>Choosing a 3d printer model for an educational project</b> <br>  For a design project, I would choose Ultimaker 2, but since the project was educational, and the guys with a technical mindset, the choice fell on PrintBox3d One (by the way, thanks to the people from RGT who went forward and helped a lot).  Firstly, it is on Arduino, and since we had a course on Arduino, the guys were interested to see its real use.  Secondly, this printer is easy to disassemble and see what's inside (even an extruder), what is irreplaceable for training.  Thirdly, it is practically unkillable, and if anything fails, it is easy to replace, since the production is in Moscow and there are a lot of parts.  Fourthly, you can almost talk with the developers of this printer, if you really need it.  Fifthly (imho), it is very valuable to show students that in Russia they can produce decent advanced equipment. <br><br>  <b>Crowdsourcing program for schools</b> <br>  There have been many discussions about how to put a 3d-printer in each school without attracting third-party funding.  By the students themselves and their parents.  (If anyone is interested, I can share my experience in this area). <br><br><h4>  Engineering Olympiad </h4><br>  In the history of cosmonautics there are several cases when it was necessary to accomplish an engineering feat with the help of scotch tape, on the knee and in a very short time. <br>  <b>The real task "Apollo 17"</b> : You have broken the wing of the electric vehicle on the Moon, dust settling on the spacesuit lowers its reflective properties, which leads to unacceptable overheating.
