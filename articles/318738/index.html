    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://blog.ganttpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PERT-main-2.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What is the evaluation and analysis technique for PERT projects? </h3><br>  <b>The PERT chart</b> is a multi-purpose project management tool that graphically displays the timeline and course of the project‚Äôs tasks. <br><br>  PERT (from Eng. Program Evaluation Review Technique) is a technique that helps define and analyze tasks and goals.  Many companies around the world use this time management technique to speed up and improve their business processes. <br><br>  The PERT chart formula was developed and described in 1958 by order of the US Navy special projects unit for a missile system project. <br><br>  These diagrams are made up of circles or rectangles (nodes), which are key milestones within the project.  Lines or vectors that define different tasks connect nodes. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://blog.ganttpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PERT-1.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  When the arrow is drawn from task A to task B, this means that task A must be completed before the start of task B. You can create parallel tasks that can be located at the same stage, but on different task lines.  They should not depend on each other. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://blog.ganttpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PERT-2.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><h3>  Elements of technology assessment and analysis of PERT projects </h3><br>  The diagram represents the events that must be implemented as part of the project‚Äôs progress. <br><br><ul><li>  The arrows show the directions and indicate the flow of events that should occur. </li><li>  Dotted lines are fictitious activities that are elements located on a different path. </li><li>  The numbers assigned to each task govern them. </li></ul><br>  Typically, the chart contains a horizontal graph with units (days or weeks). <br><br><h3>  Progressive steps to create a PERT chart </h3><br><ul><li>  Make a list of levels and stages of the project, determine the time required to complete each event. </li><li>  Add dependencies to create a connection between events. </li><li>  Lines will show the time each event takes. </li><li>  Each line in the diagram should come to a step that is associated with the completion of the event. </li></ul><br>  The chart also displays a critical path with task sequences that need to be carefully managed to complete all goals on time. <br><br><h3>  PERT examples and patterns </h3><br>  To understand how this works, you can select any pattern of the evaluation and analysis technique chart and review your case on it.  For example - a template created using the Edraw Max program: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://blog.ganttpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PERT-3.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Here you can create clear graphics using the built-in character elements.  This pattern consists of a legend, two task forms, connectors, and conclusions. <br><br>  Here is an example of an illustration of a PERT technology diagram that demonstrates how to split a garden using a diagram: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://blog.ganttpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PERT-4.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><h3>  3 programs for creating charts in the PERT assessment and analysis technique </h3><br>  We picked up examples of three tools that will help to build a PERT diagram. <br><br><h4>  SmartDraw </h4><br>  In the program, you can find a complete set of functions and design options for the implementation of your tasks.  It is suitable for Windows, Mac and Android and allows you to use dozens of patterns of PERT diagrams to perform common tasks.  You can choose one of the examples similar to your project and adapt it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://blog.ganttpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PERT-5.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><h4>  Lucidchart </h4><br>  Lucidchart is also available on Mac or Windows.  The service offers an unlimited choice of settings and powerful uses.  Here you can find a detailed description of the PERT diagrams and the Lucidchart library for working with project assessment and analysis techniques. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://blog.ganttpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PERT-6.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><h4>  Edraw max </h4><br>  In this program it is also easy to create a professional PERT chart.  With the help of convenient service tools, you can create online charts for tasks, work schedules, a critical path method, work with the task hierarchy according to the WBS structure, etc. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://blog.ganttpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PERT-7.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><h3>  PERT Project Graphics: Pros and Cons </h3><br>  The advantages of PERT charts are obvious, but project managers should also pay attention to some of the shortcomings that may be an obstacle to project implementation. <br><br>  Advantages of PERT technology for project managers: <br><br><ul><li>  Using charts, project managers can evaluate and analyze the time and resources needed for a project. <br><br></li><li>  Charts provide the ability to track and manage the assets needed at any stage of production. <br><br></li><li>  Graph analysis contains data and information from various departments.  It helps to optimize communication during the course of a project, identify responsible parties within the company, and distribute responsibility. <br><br></li><li>  Technique helps managers do what-if analysis.  Such an analysis identifies opportunities and uncertainties associated with the project and helps minimize unpleasant surprises and losses.  ‚ÄúWhat-if‚Äù also highlights all risky events and phases that require careful analysis and monitoring during project implementation. </li></ul><br>  Here, for example, the preferential differences of PERT from the method of the critical path CPM: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://blog.ganttpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PERT-8.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Some disadvantages of PERT: <br><br>  The PERT method requires the arrangement of activities in a time sequence.  The analysis process is subjective, which is why these schemes can not accurately estimate the cost and time. <br><br>  The technology determines the needs for labor and material and technical equipment for the types of activities in the project.  However, PERT is primarily a method focused on working with time. <br><br>  The method requires detailed research and study comments from many people. <br>  PERT is considered to be quite expensive equipment due to the time-consuming nature of the work. <br><br><h3>  Differences between PERT and Gant charts </h3><br>  Charts and diagrams, special programs and applications are just tools that help you manage your projects and make them better.  But you should always be ready to apply current and new options for maximum results. <br><br>  Gantt charts and PERT charts are useful tools for visualizing goals and objectives.  Both structures can be created using software applications.  The choice is yours, much depends on the specifics of the project. <br><br>  The main difference between these tools is in the way of displaying and displaying information. <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/282766/">Project management with Gantt charts is</a> based on a histogram format.  It helps to track the percentage of work completed for each task.  PERT offers a network model. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://blog.ganttpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PERT-9.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Project managers are very important to properly distribute tasks and be sure that the project will be completed by the deadline.  The focus of Gantt charts is focused on the percentage completion of each task.  The PERT technique does not provide such data.  According to this indicator, Gantt-diagrams look more convincing. <br><br>  In addition, Gantt charts are preferable for projects with a small number of interrelated tasks. <br><br>  Summarizing all the above, we would like to note that the diagrams made using the PERT project evaluation and analysis technology can be an effective tool in your activities.  It is best to compare them with the more popular Gantt charts and choose the best option for your projects. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318738/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318738/</a></p>
