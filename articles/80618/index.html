  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My fight or how to solve boot boot problem</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A topic for those who faced the problem of installing windows xp on a Mac by means of a boot camp.  It is dedicated to those who, like me, struggled with the terrible obsessive message about the absence of " <b>&lt;Windows root&gt; \ system32 \ hal.dll</b> ".  But this is in the final, and if someone is not interested in reading, you can open and read the points in bold.  And before that there is a small background with a description of my attempts at solving. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, the chef brought his aimak, to which we had to set up an operating system, which for some reason everyone is scolded, but humbled themselves before the monopolist, and yet they put it.  Anyway, and without windows you can not always do.  And if earlier I was content with virtual machines on Macs, then this time the task was a new one for me - to install Windows for real, via boot camp. <br><br>  The task seemed quite simple, the benefit of all for that.  And the corresponding utilities, and a disk with drivers, and everything else in the form of desire and opportunity.  Then everything is simple.  We split the bootcamp partitions, allocate 100 gigs for Windows (in my case), reboot and catch the boot from the CD.

      I must say that I inserted the compact on duty - the next "resuscitator", where there is everything, everything, and even windows.  This disk rescued me hundreds of times.  And what was my surprise when an error appeared on the screen.  Having driven its code into Yandex, I learned from the messages of the members of the forum that it‚Äôs un-kosher to use pirated discs, and the bootcamp to start with a CD will certainly need a license, and not a directory with windows lost somewhere in the directory tree.  <b>It was the first underwater stone</b> . <br><br>  Well, not a problem.  I have licensed windows xp in stock.  I must say that my boss is a rather conservative person, and he doesn‚Äôt tolerate all these new products in the form of whist and sevens, so that the stray license of Khrushka turned out to be very useful. <br><br>  I unpack, take out all the sparkling as Elton John disk, boot.  Everything went fine.  Then, when I had to select partitions, I LEFT fat 32. I did install all this for the first time, and I didn‚Äôt want to change default scenarios.  As is everything by default, so leave. <br><br>  The time has come before the first reboot and ... Nothing happens.  Disk Error.  <b>And it was the second underwater stone</b> .  I ran to the Internet, after which I found someone's message on the forum, where the author said to the same poor fellow, "Dude, it's useless to use FAT-32, do the NTFS partition."  Well ... Once such a thing.  Reboot, ship the disk with Windows, select the partition, say format it in NTFS.  He does it all safely, copies files, comes to the first reboot and ... <br><br>  &lt;Windows root&gt; \ system32 \ hal.dll ... Everything.  We arrived.  Again, nothing happens, again on the Internet.  There, comrades write the same suckers: but it was not necessary to format NTFS, read the manuals.  "This is how to understand, gentlemen?"  - I thought.  Some write - format.  The second "YYY, teapot, who does that, you must leave the fat-32."  What are mutually exclusive paragraphs in Apple?  I spent the next couple of hours trying to apply all sorts of tips.  Including "you formatted in ntfs, then delete this section with the bootcamp and make the same veil size."  All this seemed to be a delirium sucked from the finger, but who knows, maybe it will save.  The most characteristic, experienced makovods said that the behavior of the bootkamp depends very much on the computer model and software version, so that nobody could give out universal recipes.  I had to think it out myself. <br><br>  As you already guessed, in the first version of the error with the FAT on the face, we probably have some problem with defining the partition, but with ntfs it is still better.  At a minimum, it is already trying to boot.  And I decided to act in this direction.  I must say that the item "convert the section to ntfs" categorically did not work for me, I do not know why.  And then I decided - it means you have to do it manually, even though they wrote on the forums that it would not work. <br><br>  What I've done? <br><br>  <b>1) Butcamp creates a section.</b>  <b>FAT-32</b> <br><br>  <b>2) Loaded with live-cd.</b>  <b>Personally, I caught only infra cd</b> <br><br>  Then I thought that I had to start some partition magic, but was unpleasantly surprised that he sees fat 32 as an unformatted partition, I couldn‚Äôt do anything about it.  Then the command line remained - convert c: / fs: ntfs ... And this also had no effect - he does not want, he swears with an error. <br><br>  Here it is necessary to make another lyrical digression.  When you install windows or break a partition with some kind of Windows tool, the bootcamp does not work correctly with them.  It turns out that <b>before the Windows partition, the bootcamp places some of its information</b> .  I do not know what is there, how he uses it.  But if you demolish the fat-32 partition that created the bootcamp, and create a new partition ‚Äî these wonderful bytes are overwritten by the newly created partition, and as a result we see what I am writing about.  Partition magic resolutely did not see this magical mini-section, and also offered an unacceptable solution for me - to demolish the veil and re-do ntfs. <br><br>  And then I take and use the simplest solution - well, to hell with all this conversion.  Take and format what is.  But not like I used to - you take down the portition, you create it again .. <b>And I went to "my computer", right-click and woo-ala</b> , then you know.  My reasoning was already at the level of a freshman blonde: FAT-32 was probably created according to the principle ‚Äúfrom this sector to the very end, did you understand?‚Äù.  And, probably, when I will format in NTFS, the beginning of this section will go exactly from the same place, without affecting the magic bytes of the bootcamp ... <br><br>  Well, you understand, when everything seems to have tried, it remains to hope for such logic, which is not very full of action.  And it turned out.  It turned out to format ntfs, although it was difficult to wait for the other. <br><br>  But this is still half the battle.  Reboot, insert windows license, boot from it.  When selecting partitions, we see that ntfs is already waiting for us, i.e.  I do not need any manipulations.  <b>Leaving the file system unchanged ...</b> <br><br>  The result - I have a Windows there.  I got up without problems.  I later thought that it was probably possible to install drivers for ntfs in a Mac (for example, a paragon), and format this unfortunate section from under the disk utility ... Or something else ... But this is another story. <br><br>  I do not know how the rest of the habrovans, whether they came across this, also fought or in other ways.  But I hope that at least one user I will help my modest note. <br><br>  PS <br>  Transferred to Mac OS X <br><br>  Instead of pps <br>  My second habratopik, so do not scold much </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80618/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80618/</a></p>
