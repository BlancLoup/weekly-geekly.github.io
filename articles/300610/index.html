      AlpIndustria has been working in the extreme tourism market for 20 years.  ‚ÄúWe have a narrow field of activity and a special target audience, which cannot without mountains and hikes.  This saves us from the collapse that has come to the tourism industry, ‚Äùadmits Peter. <br>  Nevertheless, sales began to sink in 2015 - compared with the previous year, they fell by 11%.  In 2016, no one expected positive dynamics. <br><br>  At the same time, the drop in sales did not affect the traffic of the site in any way - as it was high, it remained so.  It was like people going to the store to gape and dream about buying.  Who is bolder - ‚Äútry on‚Äù, but do not make purchases. <br><br>  The company faced the task of finding tools to increase site conversion.  Conversion is called the lead (called, wrote, left the phone), which became a client.  They assumed that there was a lack of a tool that would be always at hand of the site visitor and unobtrusively called for action, and decided to try an online chat. <br><br>  <b>Slander Chat</b> <br><br>  An experienced employee was assigned to the chat.  He processed 20-60 hits per day. <br><br>  Appeals came at the same time, and then the specialist was broken, and potential customers were waiting for a response.  It would be possible to shorten the talk time by taking clients to a telephone conversation.  But they reluctantly went to direct contact.  It seemed that people were collecting information for an independent tour. <br><br>  In addition, the chat turned out to be an excellent platform for ‚ÄúInternet terrorists‚Äù who need the slightest reason for conflict.  The fifth part of the conversations was a natural mockery of the site visitor over the operator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ff/bf9/984/4ffbf998438e492898952f1d044cd19a.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Results</b> : the chat turned out to be similar to the hotline (8-800), which generated a lot of requests with a slight conversion - only 2%.  Unobtrusively calling for action did not work out, the operator hardly paid for himself, and the chats had to be abandoned. <br><br>  <b>Experiments with callback service</b> <br><br>  In "AlpIndustrii" and before they thought to connect a callback, but for various reasons did not "reach out."  Decided after when they saw the callback-button from their consulting partners.  The price of the post-test service period turned out to be more than tempting: 4 rubles per minute throughout Russia. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe composition of the groups that go with us to the mountains is half represented by customers from the regions.  It was important for us to provide them with free and affordable communication.  Once this was the reason for the purchase of 8-800 - remembers Peter.  - But the cost of communication turned out to be significant: for example, a call from a mobile from St. Petersburg to our Moscow office cost 3.97 rubles / minute.  And this is not the farthest region from which we get customers.  Not every small or even medium-sized business will allow itself to maintain a hotline. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ea/44e/e79/4ea44ee79abe47e79ebbc91fdbfa267d.png"><br><br>  We decided to try <a href="http://pozvonim.com/">callback service with cheaper rates</a> . <br>  The provider provided us with 50 free test minutes, so even if the monthly experiment failed with him, it would cost us a maximum of 3,000 rubles (750 rubles - monthly fee, the rest - payment for telephone traffic at the price of 4 rubles / minute) ". <br><br>  <b>When to catch a client</b> <br><br>  The basic settings of the callback services are devoted to the moment of ‚Äúcapturing‚Äù the site visitor and proposing that the client be called back quickly. <br><br>  There are four scenarios of ‚Äúcapture‚Äù: at the entrance, at the exit, the client searches for a long time, returns. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe argue heatedly with the marketer about what parameters to set,‚Äù says Peter.  ‚ÄúI, as a person interested in fast sales, insisted on an aggressive" takeover. " <br>  But the marketer, who also cares about the company's image, judged differently.  He analyzed the content of the site, the average time spent on it, the level of competition in the market and suggested less aggressive tactics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/071/663/7b5/0716637b5b114599b73717ba6edace2c.png"><br><br>  What changed for the "less aggressive tactics": <br><br>  For new visitors: there was a call for a form in 30 seconds, we switched to 120, so that a person could look at the site; <br>  For departing visitors: the standard form was shown to those who leave after spending more than 30 seconds on the site, we increased the threshold to 150; <br>  Showing the form for those who are looking for information for more than a certain time: it was 90 seconds, it became 300. <br><br>  With the advent of the callback, visitors could choose a manager for consultation even before the call to the company.  On the hotline, this happened 1.5 minutes after the IVR greeting. <br><br>  6-8 calls were received per day through the service, but their quality was higher than on the hotline.  Of the 10 incoming requests, 8 were targeted: people asked specific questions about the trip. <br><br>  ‚ÄúTo get a call back, you must leave your phone number.  The realization that you get into the base of the company is a limiting barrier for those who have no serious intentions, Peter says.  ‚ÄúSo the callback generates better traffic.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Why did it work?</b> <br><br>  In "AlpIndustrii" believe that the tool perfectly reflects the character of the audience.  The company's clients are middle and top managers who, by virtue of their lifestyle, are used to solving issues quickly and in a businesslike manner.  The opportunity in less than half a minute to discuss the details of the trip they like. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe work with determined and courageous people,‚Äù Peter explains.  - The offer to call back in 28 seconds gives rise to a natural excitement to check whether the company will succeed.  The countdown after pressing the "Waiting for a call" button is of genuine interest: people are looking at running numbers without stopping.  This keeps them on our site.  Do not be a countdown, during this time they would have moved to the site of a competitor. " <br>  Statistics showed that conversations with those who subsequently enter into a contract last 6-10 minutes.  This is surprisingly small compared to the hotline, where conversations lasted 20-40 minutes. <br><br>  <b>Bug work</b> <br><br>  In the first month, eight targeted calls resulted in four sales.  ‚ÄúDespite the fact that the conversion now was not 12, but 40%, and many more contracts were prepared than in the previous month, I was haunted by the idea that we are not working out all the possibilities of the tool. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf we have 8 targeted requests, then there should be 8 sales,‚Äù insists Peter.  - I started listening to the recordings of the salesmen‚Äôs conversations, and found a number of errors.  Often sellers took on too much and advised on issues that are not competent. <br><br>  <b>For example</b> : the client found out everything about the trip and started asking questions about the equipment.  The seller had to immediately switch it to the department that deals with the equipment, but did not.  Began to advise, give inaccurate information.  And then, when his knowledge in equipment ended, he broke down and said: ‚ÄúOk, I will now connect with a specialist.‚Äù  This made an unpleasant impression on a potential client - he lost time listening to this manager. <br><br>  This influenced the attitude to the company and subsequently the deal.  We also revealed other errors that led to the adjustment of the sales script.  As a result, we raised the conversion to 60%.  And I think this is not the limit. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>How beautiful to annoy the troll</b> <br><br>  Floating callback button attracts not only people who are ready for a hike.  The problem of "telephone terrorists" remained.  But now we solve it simply.  When receiving a call from these people, and seeing their IP address, we simply block their IP address or phone number.  The widget is not shown to them - they cannot order a call back.  This saves us money and nerves. <br><br>  <b>Result</b> <br><br>  For four months, AlpIndustria increased sales by 32% compared to last year and 24% compared to the pre-crisis year, replacing the hotline with <a href="http://pozvonim.com/">a callback</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7cd/8ef/d22/7cd8efd22235498bb87a1dfbd4b1478d.JPG"><br><br>  The company began to receive fewer calls, but 80% of them are targeted.  Rejecting 8-800, AlpIndustria saved about 30,000 rubles in 4 months.  Over the same period, she spent 4,000 rubles on communication through a <a href="http://pozvonim.com/">callback service</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300610/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300610/</a></p>
