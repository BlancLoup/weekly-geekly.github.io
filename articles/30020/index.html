  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Steve is fine</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Puzzled by the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/apple/47578.html">article</a> that appeared today.  I had previously thought about not writing about it, because I was not sure that someone‚Äôs personal life was interesting to anyone.  From <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/07/23/steve_jobs_in_good_health_following_second_surgery_report.html">reliable sources it is</a> known that with the health of Steve Jobs everything is in order and he is not going to leave Apple. <br><br>  Steve Jobs recently reported that rumors of his deteriorating health are greatly exaggerated.  According <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/23/technology/23apple.html%3F_r%3D1%26oref%3Dslogin">to the New York Times</a> , he recently had problems with rapid weight loss, with which the head of Apple <strong>coped</strong> , having undergone an operation. <br><br>  ‚ÄúRecently, Steve Jobs assured several interested people that he feels well and that four years after a successful operation to remove a rare form of cancer, he is no longer sick,‚Äù says the New York Times article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The recent time has paid attention to Steve's health, especially on Wall Street - large investors, Apple and other people from investment management assumed that Steve Jobs's cancer had returned.  Such rumors appeared after Steve's speech at the WWDC and the recent presentations of the iPhone 3G.  As you remember, right after WWDC, an Apple spokesperson stated that the disease was not serious, and Steve was taking antibiotics.  The Times article also quoted the words of an Apple employee who talks about the high temperature of Steve Jobs during the week when WWDC began.  Steve thought to cancel his speech, but then decided to still take the first presentation of the new iPhone 3G by himself.

      The ambiguity of Apple‚Äôs health situation led to a request from Lehman Brothers analyst Ben Raitzes to Apple Finance Director Peter Oppenheimer to make an official health statement on Steve Jobs during a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/apple/47265.html">July 21 conference call</a> . <br><br>  ‚ÄúBen, Steve loves Apple,‚Äù said Oppenheimer.  ‚ÄúHe holds the post of CEO at the request of the Apple board of directors and does not plan to leave the company.‚Äù <br><br>  It is said that Steve, who always watched, who can be left as a successor - in case you have to leave the company - took a week‚Äôs well-deserved vacation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30020/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30020/</a></p>
