  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Evernote: Unhappily Ever After</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I do not particularly like to make trouble, so I endured for a long time.  I tried to talk about serious problems with Evernote in <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/evernote_ru/34480.html">their community</a> , but they didn't listen to me.  Since then, I have received many more negative impressions of the service and today, seeing the banner on Habr√©, I decided to enter into a more frank dialogue with the company. <br><br>  A year ago, when I started using Evernote and paid for it, I was impressed.  Good software for Mac, favorable conditions - what you need!  The community seemed responsive and benevolent, they just introduced shared notebooks.  ‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù I decided, and made Evernote an integral part of the workflow. <br><br>  A year later, it turned out that software for Mac does not develop at all.  There is no question of the wonderful shared notebooks being finally supported by the client.  Even obvious problems are not corrected.  Yes, the iPhone software has become much better, thanks.  However, you can still use it only in write-only mode.

      However, the real shock I experienced <a name="habracut"></a>  when it was on the machine with Windows XP, and, inspired by promises, I decided to synchronize my database.  I heard that the new version of Evernote for Windows was shocking to many, but I assumed that the habit and problems with polishing the new interface were to blame.  Hell no.  This piece of software does not work at all. <br><br>  - I was able to synchronize with 7 attempts.  At a certain stage, it stops the download and looks at you in misunderstandings.  And does not want to close.  Knock the process.  Kisochka, well, still a bit, eh? <br>  - It eats memory in an incredible amount.  Yes, I got a weak machine with 1GB of RAM, but for the rest of the office software it is enough.  And adding will not help, judging by the nature of the brakes.  Check in soon. <br>  - It is incredibly slow.  Slowly draws, it climbs all the time to synchronize and, what is the most nasty, is not at all ashamed to forget about ‚Äúpromises‚Äù and roll back the changes. <br>  - Permanent black screen in place of the application window.  Hardly knock out the process again. <br><br>  And that‚Äôs Core 2 Duo!  The poor guys trying to use this software on netbooks, where it would seem to be the place! <br><br>  I understand everything, of course, XP is an old system, and I would have left it with great pleasure, but this is not always possible.  If you decide not to support it, make it beautiful, please leave a <i>working</i> version for this system.  And experiment with newfangled frameworks do in a version designed for other systems. <br><br>  No, I do not mind the money: while I wore a laptop everywhere, Evernote worked them honestly.  I feel sorry that from an interesting young company, Evernote has become a monster who is engaged in product promotion instead of improving it and carpet ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù instead of dialogue with users. <br><br>  At least write me the answer. <br>  Bye your, Payalnik. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89812/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89812/</a></p>
