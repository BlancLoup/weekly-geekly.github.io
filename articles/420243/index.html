Yes, this is outdated information and there are a lot of common words in the reports, but as a starting point for the discussion, I think it will come down.

I want to thank you all for having this evening thanks to you.  I would like to summarize by discussing three partially related thoughts about advanced technology. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>One of the paradigms</b> that I often thought about and which can be traced in the statements of all the groups that we heard today is the difference between continuous progress and intensive progress.  Continuous progress is when you take things that already work, and expand them, and then copy them exactly.  This is a very important thing.  Most of what is happening today in emerging markets is long in nature.  The plan in essence is to catch up with the developed world and copy what works.  This is a kind of plan that China and many other countries adhere to.  Another model is intensive progress, where you take the best things in the world and you try to improve them qualitatively and radically.  And this is what should happen in the developing world.  Despite the fact that these models are related, it is possible to implement both of them.  We need to implement both models.  But by nature they are quite different.  You can imagine intensive progress as moving from 0 to 1, and continuous progress as moving from 1 to many or from 1 to N. And you need to do both.  You need to make continuous progress horizontally and intensive progress vertically. <br><br>  <b>A second similar thought</b> is that one of the reactions that people often experience in these groups is the feeling that everything sounds very strange.  And many things really sound very strange.  And I think it is in the nature of all intensive things.  Every time you move from 0 to 1, you do something unusual, something that no one has ever done.  For people it will sound unprecedented and surprising and will be considered strange.  In the case of extensive things, everything is different.  You simply mechanically copy things that have already worked.  This approach is also very appreciated, but it is much more generally accepted.  I think that as a society, we have a kind of ordinary dilemma.  In the sense that we either implement strange ideas and can be optimistic about the future, or we drop everything new, call into question and enter a much more pessimistic zone.  I think that one of the things we would like to encourage people to try to do is move towards the future, it will inspire us and I think that this is the only way to really try to create a more optimistic, better world in the 21st century. <br><br>  <b>The third thought</b> regarding all this is that the future is not an abstraction, it is not something that just happens, it is not what other people do.  The future is that in which we all participate, that we all help to create, invent and shape.  If we do this and are determined to do this, I think we can achieve much more.  This evening was a terrific start to a kind of conversation in action, and I encourage people to look around, eat, talk informally and start building the future of the 21st century.  Thank. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581">Peter Diamandis</a> </h3>  <i>X-Prize, Human Longevity, Planetary Resources</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0vhixNfM1w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  First of all, I would like to thank Peter, it was an amusing, amusing conversation and I know that I will look forward to speaking with whom I will speak after me.  The goal of XPrize is to promote radical advances for the benefit of humanity  Our task is to make a novelty in philanthropy, to make it effective and widely used.  Imagine what people would do if they were spending $ 10 for every dollar you spend.  Global and since radical achievements need to be brought to the market.  Not just ideas, demonstrate them and bring these things to the market.  For us, XPrize is a great inspirational reward that will belong to a team that can actually demonstrate a new technology or a new system. <br><br>  So far we have created 4 XPrize.  Two of them have already been awarded.  One, Ansari XPrize was given away for private spaceflight: three people went into space, returned, did it again after 2 weeks.  Paul Allen supported Bert Rutan, who won this prize.  Last September, a progressive automobile insurance company won its prize for a new generation of cars that travel 100 miles with one gallon.  It is a safe equivalent of energy, ready for production, beautiful.  He can make a novelty in the cars that we drive.  Surprisingly, today we have $ 10 million, our reward for genomic sequencing: a hundred human genomes in ten days.  And Google Lunar Xprize fund of $ 30 million.  All you need to do is build a robot, land it on the surface of the Moon, send photos and videos in the area of ‚Äã‚Äã500m.  This work was done by our biggest benefactors, members of the Vision Circle and the Board of Trustees: guys like Larry Page, Dean Keimen, Craig Venter, Dustin Moskowitz.  We are proud of the support they gave us, they gave us the opportunity to try and bring something new into the future of philanthropy. <br><br>  You know, in a world where technology is developing so rapidly, small teams and individuals can do incredible things, things that only the government or large corporations were capable of.  Now they give you the opportunity.  The question is that if you passionately want to change and create the future, how do you want to interest these people?  How are you going to motivate them to solve the huge problems that you want to see solved?  This is what we do in XPrize. <br><br><blockquote>  We create distinct, clear, measurable demands and say: ‚ÄúWe don't give a damn where you come from and what you have ever done if you solve this problem and win.‚Äù </blockquote><br>  In addition to XPrize, we hold contests for a million dollars.  We recently launched our first major competition: a contest for the best way to clean the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãoil from Wendy Schmidt.  1.4 million dollars to make something new in the purification of water from oil.  Since there has been no change between the Exxon Valdez disaster and the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform, no changes have occurred in 20 years.  We have registered 400 teams that will compete in foot this summer to make a difference.  Thank. <br><br>  I was passionate about spaceflight.  In 1996, I went to St. Louis and recruited 12 residents, who earned about a hundred thousand dollars each for three years.  Of course, hundreds of thousands of dollars each year.  And that was my initial capital.  They let me go and raise funds for the first XPrize, for designing XPrize, and it was a stunning success.  I have two seats on two rockets going into space, and I look forward to flying.  In perspective, we are going to do it again.  These are the four areas in which we are currently distributing XPrize, these are the four areas.  And we want to repeat this model.  We call on St. Louis and everyone with the " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_of_St._Louis">spirit of St. Louis</a> " to help us.  We are looking for about a dozen people to each of these areas, who can contribute $ 100,000 a year for three years to work with us to make clear, passionate, meaningful, inspiring prizes to these areas.  We will use your money, as we did with Ansari XPrize.  Two million dollars in prizes results in a prize of $ 10 million, which in turn leads to hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses for a team and creates an industry worth a billion dollars.  Our passion is to create a future in which we want to live, it is to bring something new into it, make it effective, make it beautiful and attract the most brilliant people, and then let them focus on the biggest, the most significant global issues.  Please join us.  Thank. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C,_%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD">Ben hertzel</a> </h3>  <i>Humanity +, Biomind, OpenCog</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xdf9luLUDuY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  None of us knows for sure what the future has prepared for us, but we know the possibilities and this is amazing.  We have the potential to create a world in which people live as long as they want, where the deficit has sunk into oblivion, where the brain and body of a person are radically improved, where friendly artificial intelligence is smarter than any of us helps us achieve our goals.  There are also more sad possibilities. <br><br>  Humanity + exists to help humanity build the future correctly, not just to create technologies, but to create technologies that will actually work for all of us and for those who come after us.  Those of you who already know me may be surprised to see me here telling about Humanity +.  I am rather known as a research scientist.  I started out as a mathematician, and now I‚Äôm exploring artificial intelligence in robotics, life extension, neuroinformatics and other areas.  I am also interested in the transference of consciousness, genetic engineering, nanotechnology, femtotechnologies and much more.  The reason why I became part of Humanity + is that it looks like the only organization that is going to cover all of these different areas, including their interconnection and wider applications, including the fact that they want to make sure that these technologies will evolve to our advantage.  We all have rights to their beneficial effects. <br><br><blockquote>  I think the world needs a world-class organization that is dedicated to future technologies in the broad sense of the word, not tied to any particular kind of technology or problem. </blockquote><br>  Humanity + is now a small organization, but I am here because I think it has the potential to grow into something very important and significant.  What does Humanity + do?  We have meetings all over the world, we hold conferences, we have our own magazine, we finance research and development.  Our collections spread information about advanced technologies and thoughts about the future in a dozen different countries.  We bring together a huge variety of views and a correct understanding of the future, as well as different points of view about what the correct understanding of the future really means.  Our last conference was at the California Institute of Technology last weekend, just a couple of days ago.  We had classes in artificial intelligence, economics, art and design, as well as in human longevity.  For example, in a class dedicated to longevity, we had Michael Rhodes from the University of California and Aubrey de Gray from the SENS Foundation, discussing very different approaches to ending aging.  These two researchers often argued in the past in academic literature, but after speaking at our conference, Michael Rhodes said that this was the most significant exchange of experience between the two researchers.  Our ultimate goal for all of these conferences is to work on a common understanding of how to create a better future using current and emerging technologies.  We want to bring together researchers who have overlapping ideas or even conflicting ideas, and try to understand their main differences of opinion, but what they look at the same way and try to build a future together. <br><br>  The editor of our magazine H + Magazine is RU Sirius, who has been the leader of futuristic journalism for decades.  Perhaps some of you remember his previous magazine Mondo2000, which was published long before the future became fashionable.  RU Sirius in 2011 created a new magazine issue: ‚ÄúThe problem is solved.  Humanity + solves all the world's problems.  Of course, RU Sirius is always a little embellishing.  We definitely will not solve all the world's problems next year, but the point is to think positively.  Every month we will look at different problems and collect the opinions of various experts on how advanced technologies can solve them.  We also publish certain future-oriented books using the Humanity + Press. <br><br>  We collaborate with scientists and engineers around the world in research and development projects, helping them to gain funding and multidisciplinary thinking with respect to technologies that, in our opinion, have the greatest potential to make the greatest changes.  We issue the Gada Personal Manufacturing Prize together with people working in the RepRap 3D printer.  We work with White Tag on the Internet of things, where every physical object has an IP address.  The use of the Internet of Things promotes mobile healthcare.  And we are working with OpenCog, which is my personal open source project.  OpenCog is trying to build a common artificial intelligence, thinking machines that think also as people, but in the long run more generalized and harder than people do.  We are working on this together with invited researchers from the United States and Hong Kong, China and Europe.  Humanity + helps to obtain funding and multidisciplinary expertise of the OpenCog project on artificial intelligence. <br><br>  We are an extensive organization, we do not concentrate on only one specific technology or problem, but since our goal is global, it requires certain actions.  We could benefit from your help right now with the initiative of our magazine called ‚Äúproblem solved‚Äù.  We need your help to solve all the world's problems.  We may need your help to spread the Internet of things.  We may need your help with the OpenCog project to create a useful overall level of intelligence.  In the end, if we can create an artificial general intelligence much more powerful than human thinking, many other problems and many other technologies will not cause such problems as they are now.  There is a lot more to say and I would like to talk to you about many other cool things, so come to talk to me tonight, send me letters, communicate with other representatives of Humanity + who are here today, stay at our table.  This is only the beginning of a long conversation, one of the most important conversations that can be. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Peterson">Christine Peterson</a> </h3>  <i>Foresight Institute, nanotechnology, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model">introduced the concept of open source</a></i> <br><br>  Let's experiment a little.  Let's think about how the world will look after the nanotechnological revolution, which will give us absolute control over the structure of the material down to the atomic level.  What would the environment look like?  In general, this would mean the end of chemical pollution of the environment.  We could have a lifestyle that we enjoy today with zero pollution by chemicals.  What would medicine be like?  We could have systems of molecular machines, so small that they could penetrate the body, kill certain cancer cells, clean your arteries, even repair your DNA molecules.  Let's consider transport.  We could create such a strong material and so light that we could send a family of four along with the luggage into orbit in a spacecraft the size of a car. <br><br>  Now you might think it sounds like science fiction.  And you know what?  Yes it is.  And this means that you pay attention and do it right, because this is what the technical revolution looks like.  She looks like science fiction.  And you have already seen one.  I want you to remember what happened 20 years ago.  What did the information world look like?  Gods, the word ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù was a new word, HTML was something completely new, it was just beginning to develop gradually, your personal computer was ridiculous by today's standards, your bandwidth almost did not exist.  Think about how the world has changed for you in 20 years.  This is a technical revolution in the information space.  I am talking about doing the same thing by introducing a discrete level of control into the physical world.  Instead of doing it with bits, you should do it with atoms. <br><br>  How do we do this?  So as nature does: through the systems of molecular machines.  Yes, these are really molecular machines.  So nature does it, so we will do it.  Our cars will be designed, they will not evolve.  There is a nation that has begun this process, to build a molecular computer with logical elements consisting exclusively of molecules.  These elements will be built literally atom by atom.  Rising Nation.  Who is this?  Perhaps you are thinking: ‚Äúis this China?‚Äù Almost.  This is Singapore.  The most advanced theoretical work on nanotechnology comes from the United States.  I would say that most of it, the best part of it, was created here in the Gulf area, which is not surprising because it is firmly tied to calculations, and this is our strong point.  But the best experimental work moves to Singapore.  How so? <br><br>  At Foresight, we would like the United States, in particular the Gulf region, to be the world leader in this race for molecular machine systems.  What are we doing?  First: we are looking for geniuses.  We do this with the help of the Feynman award in the field of nanotechnology.  Every year we choose the best ones in the framework of experimental work and theoretical work as well.  And we give them our Feynman award, named, of course, in honor of Richard Feynman.  I usually deal with calls.  This is the fun part of my job.  You will not believe how excited they are when they hear that they have won the Nobel Prize.  So nice to call these guys.  Then we put them together.  Putting them together is a multidisciplinary task.  We need chemists, physicists, biologists, scientists in the field of materials, EES.  And all this is sealed by computing itself.  This is the glue that lets it all fall apart. <br><br>  We put them together and point them to the goal, what then to do?  Then a plan is drawn up for the development and introduction of new technologies, here it is, this is the first draft.  I want to thank again Ted Waite, the founder of Gateway computers for funding this plan, the first draft.  What is the next step?  Then you need to delve into the details, you need to implement the plan and do it here in the bay area.  I know, I saw a list of those who are here, I know that we have the brains to do it.  This group has the brains to do it.  We also have financial resources.  Foresight has a suitable grant that we issue at the end of the year.  All that you do not take, will pay off.  But more than that, I want your skill set.  The skill set in this room is enormous.  I want you to come to our table, I want you to tick Foresight and contact us.  We want you to be on our team.  Thank you very much. <br><br><h3>  Still </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Introduction, Jim O'Neill and Patri Friedman</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rLjIQPsV6VU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Chris Wood, Santa Fe Institute</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Q4uhU9SyMo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Neil Jacobstein, Singularity University</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FRXzphFxijc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Michael Vassar, Singularity Institute</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S8NYfqnb04U" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Mike Kope, SENS Foundation</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LxL9J2IIe8Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Patri Friedman, The Seasteading Institute</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P2KmRb_ryhI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vq/um/p6/vqump6po8z9qddw4v2mmrm7uuks.jpeg" alt="image"><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">About the global initiative #philtech</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>#philtech (technology + philanthropy)</b> is an open, publicly described technology that aligns the standard of living of as many people as possible by creating transparent platforms for interaction and access to data and knowledge.
