Well, then continue, part 2 is a continuation of the first part, that is, an overview of popular services in the Arab segment of the network.  In some ways, this is the continuation of ‚Äúsuccess stories‚Äù they simply (it so happened) overlap with those services of the owners of which, I know well, and therefore you shouldn‚Äôt reproach me with excessive emotionality and subjectivity, consider it rather as ‚Äúinsider revelations‚Äù ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Beer, Sex and Rock'n'roll or why there was no Yandex in Saudi Arabia?</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/88f/c04/2ea/88fc042ead6dfd994b079ed941a16580.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Saudi Arabia - a country of contrasts!  The country in which the incompatible was combined.  A country in which there are ultra-modern technologies, skyscrapers, modern cars, a very high standard of living, here for the first time I saw a queue for laptops and ... a penalty after Friday prayer, in the square for the edification of the people, though they chopped not their head, but their hand (for stealing). <br><br>  Here you will not see a single woman visiting the Saud, but if you are a Bengali or a Hindu, and serve as a chauffeur in his house, you can see all his women in nighties, they will not even hide, because you are not from owners of the book "that is, do not represent one of the Abrahamic religions, and therefore you are not a man from whom to hide.  On the street, all women are dressed like ninjas, and you will not see a woman driving a car, but if you get into the "compound" for foreigners, you will be shocked because there, in the compound, Europe, America, or so civilized world, all its attributes, including drinking, for which, outside the compound, you can and, no hand will be cut off, but can be carved out and expelled from the country. <br><br>  Why such an introductory?  So that you had an idea why what I‚Äôll say below happens.  You have all heard about censorship in China, but I think few of you know that there is even more severe censorship in Saudi Arabia, though, since the guys are lazy, they don‚Äôt catch bloggers and do not filter everything, including mail, they approached The issue is extremely simple.

      So, all communication belongs to the state company <a href="http://internet.gov.sa/">internet.gov.sa</a> they distribute traffic to providers, who in turn simply resell it.  All requests pass exclusively through the filters of the state supplier, everything is covered up, how?  - Elementary Watson closed all IP except those that are allowed, filtering is described <a href="http://www.internet.gov.sa/learn-the-web/guides/content-filtering-in-saudi-arabia/view%3Fset_language%3Den">here</a> :) <br><br>  When I first came to Saudi Arabia, what was my surprise when I saw this <a href="http://www.internet.gov.sa/resources/block-unblock-request/unblock/view%3Fset_language%3Den">form</a> instead of the main page for the query <a href="http://yandex.ru/">yandex.ru</a> :-) <br><br>  Gruzdem got into the body, I typed in the form that I wanted to see the site of the largest Russian search engine, and I swear that there are no naked women on this site, roulettes, and any godless obscenity.  To pay tribute, after 4 days, Yandex opened, naturally any search did not give results because all the sites did not open, but instead I saw all the same form :) But there was access to the mail, which was not bad. <br><br>  If some clever man created a website, unblocked it, and then uploaded ‚Äúbad‚Äù content, then any God-fearing citizen may ask to block this website, in this case, the domain goes to an eternal ban!  :) You can do this by using this <a href="http://www.internet.gov.sa/resources/block-unblock-request/block">form</a> . <br><br>  And in these conditions it becomes popular ... PalTalk <br><br>  <b>Paltalk</b> <br>  I don‚Äôt know the history of the service itself, but I‚Äôll tell you another, so 2003, a couple of guys from Jordan, Wahid Essale and Saleh Asad are studying in Australia, the first is studying to be a laboratory technician, the second is graduating from a master‚Äôs degree in the Database of Sydney University, Wahid meets one of the directors PalTalk and ... decides to take a license for a BV service branch. <br><br>  Since he himself has unique management abilities, but not understanding IT technologies, he convinces (almost by force) Saleh Asad to write a website selling PalTalk service accounts for the Middle East.  So the service <a href="http://alpadeel.com/">alpadeel.com</a> appeared <a href="http://alpadeel.com/">.</a> And here the story about Saudi Arabia?  So, by some miracle, the guys from the state Internet provider missed and did not close it, it was something!  Service becomes mega popular!  What does the average Saudi online do?  He either plays on the local stock exchange, or sits in PalTalk !!!  Any saudit may not know or not hear about FacacBook, but PalTalk knows everything!  If in the last topic I wrote that for the Arab world Maktub is our everything!  So for the Saud, PalTalk is our everything !!! <br><br>  Suffice it to say that the entire social life of the Saudi network takes place in PalTalk, where you can meet everyone, princes, ministers, ordinary citizens, princesses, and even executioners :) The service is free, but if you want to create a room and from there broadcast to the world, then pay when They introduced nicknames in Arabic (for a fee), with the ability to paint them in seven colors of the rainbow, my friends went to round-the-clock work, did not have time to sell, because they are only intermediaries, they naturally take only a percentage, and not a big one.  but the amount of money (this small percentage) is calculated in nine-digit numbers in US dollars (how much does PalTalk have? For me, a mystery).  Because if there are solvent guys in BV who almost without exception buy the software, and do not steal (because they are lazy, and there is money), so these guys live here, hello Saudi Arabia - I love you!  How good it is when there is so much oil for such not greedy and lazy guys! <br><br>  Why did I mention women sauditok and blamed for not being allowed to drive cars?  Yes, because they all have servants at home, from Bangladesh and the Philippines, and they have two things to do in life, the first is shopping, when clothes in megamall are bought by carts (like in supermarkets) and sit on forums!  Forum Eve or Arabic Hawa (naked) :))) <a href="http://forum.hawaaworld.com/index.php">forum.hawaaworld.com/index.php</a> <br><br> <a href="http://a.imagehost.org/view/0374/hawa"><img src="http://a.imagehost.org/t/0374/hawa.jpg" width="150" height="116" alt="hawa.png (213 KB)"></a> <br>  <i>This is a screenshot of visitors at an o'clock of the morning namaz, at 5 am local time, the most uncommon time to press ctr + twice, and all visitors did not fit.</i>  <i>2543 registered ladies, and more than 6 thousand guests, and only on the forum :)</i> <br><br>  (1,135,035 sabzh, 26,148,242 posts, 800 thousand visits per day, and from 10 to 25 thousand Arab women at the forum at the same time) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8b4/60e/8f2/8b460e8f2ee1cf38299ae9b561c3286c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>If everything is covered, what is possible, especially men?</b> <br><br>  Men?  But what about trading on the stock exchange in the last topic I touched on, so more than a third of Saudi Arabia out of 14,000 followers of <a href="http://tickerchart.com/">tickerchart.com</a> ?  But what about the games (for teenagers) more than a third of the subscribers of all online games BV, kids from the same SA, how does Football in the end <a href="http://kooora.com/">kooora.com</a> well, in Alex's rating on SA honorable 11th place after Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Maktoob! <br><br>  <i>Unfortunately, so that it is understandable, you have to do a lot of lyrical indents.</i> <br><br>  So in SA, it is a sin to deal with credit cards :) But everyone has several pieces, so where does ‚Äúsinfulness‚Äù appear? <br><br>  If I trust a credit card issuer company in SA, let's say Visa cannot legally do anything to me with Visa, if they go to court, the court will say, but go to hell, sinful moneylenders!  :))) And it will be a problem Visa, and everyone knows about it, but can not do anything, the market for money that goes on credit calculations in the SA is huge in absolute terms.  Besides, issuer companies are not allowed to require collateral, or whatever, for a credit card, it usually happens that you sit in the office, a sad guy, usually a Hindu, comes to you and starts begging you just for help that you are an employee (any) on this basis, he is trying to stick you the tenth credit card :) And what to do with ten credit cards, if you already have a couple of jeeps? <br><br>  Buying <a href="http://jarirbookstore.com/">jarirbookstore.com</a> laptops <a href="http://jarirbookstore.com/">correctly</a> , PalTalk, software, etc.  Do I need to attach them somewhere ?!  True, from the first 50 sites I found only one site that directly asked for money in the forehead, this is <a href="http://mozook.com/">mozook.com</a> (320 thousand visits per day) well, is it necessary to listen to something on the mobile phone?  Before visiting the site of your favorite team <a href="http://alhilal.com/">alhilal.com</a> (50 thousand <a href="http://alhilal.com/">unique visitors</a> per day.), <a href="http://mexat.com/">Read the</a> news of the world of games <a href="http://mexat.com/">mexat.com</a> (102 thousand visits per day) Once again sit on the forum <a href="http://adslgate.com/dsl/">adslgate.com/dsl</a> 311002 registered users and 4 million posts.  Yes, men are not women!  Where to them to <a href="http://hawaaworld.com/">hawaaworld.com</a> :)) <br><br>  <i>Such a closed openness, there is only the Saudis, the most solvent Arabs.</i>  <i>There are other BV countries that do not sparkle with openness, but there it is tied to politics, and not to religious regulations, in this respect, the CA is the only (I know) unique country.</i>  <i>In which, by the way, it is full of Americans, and many companies, there are holding offices at a loss !!!</i>  <i>Only in order to indicate the presence, with an eye to the future.</i>  <i>My acquaintance Bassam Arabi is a former ATM specialist from Arab Bank, signed a contract (I think with a Swedish company) and sits in SA, full-time, with American salary, and according to his assurances does not do anything!</i>  <i>Simply, denotes the presence of your company</i>  <i>:) I tend to believe him, for the reason that I personally know several companies that do the same.</i> <br><br>  For today, perhaps all.  I do not draw conclusions, figures and links, so that you would appreciate the quality of the service sites I gave. <br><br>  Now I‚Äôll probably finish with the lyrics in posts and digressions, because the following parts of my narrative, in my plan created on the basis of questions from a good habrovchanin <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/67782/">serge2</a> , will be rather dry and reporting: <br><br>  <s>- National features of the Arabic Internet</s> with this we seem to have ended in two parts. <br>  - The solvency of the Arab world, the payment system, the percentage of paying users <br>  - Laws relating to the Internet and business in the Arab States <br>  - Interface features of web sites <br>  - Language features (dialects, the most common languages, etc.) <br>  - Forbidden topics, mentality, what can and should not be done <br><br>  <i>If you have any more questions that interest ask.</i> <br><br>  <b>PS I don‚Äôt like to post my posts to Social Networks, can make a blog, ‚Äúanother Internet‚Äù where descriptions from the ‚Äúother world‚Äù will be brought, because there is a huge Asia and South America, and these are other worlds in general ... that we don‚Äôt know much about</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68275/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68275/</a></p>
