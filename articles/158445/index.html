In order not to create a huge sheet, we will publish the third part at the end of the week. <br><br>  <b>Attention!</b>  The post is heavy - with a lot of insider photo cards.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0af/74c/b98/0af74cb981de8205f63aa700b11b23b0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6fc/dec/4b9/6fcdec4b9ba6a2b7b8c9d7493884453a.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <font color="ffd800">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Introduction</font> </h2><br>  The IFA 2012 exhibition has probably begun with the largest crowd I have ever seen.  I was happy to be on it to talk about the latest trends in technology. <br><br>  Among the seven products that Samsung showed, the focus, in my opinion, was not the GALAXY Note II smartphone, but the GALAXY Camera.  What makes GALAXY Camera special, causing such keen interest from the media? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b9b/156/904/b9b156904a95361e5dfc2cd9341ac703.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="60ff00">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Design</font> </h2><br>  As you probably already know, the GALAXY Camera looks very much like the GALAXY S III.  The hardware of the GALAXY S III is almost completely migrated to the GALAXY Camera and has been complemented by an optical system that Samsung Digital Imaging Business has produced. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/874/219/45c/87421945c03b522dd08863005b1849be.jpg"><br><br>  I was particularly impressed by the connection between the smartphone and the camera, but this product was created with an even greater synergistic effect from combining the two devices. <br><br>  Of course, this is not a smartphone, so it can not be used for calls.  But, nevertheless, the new gadget has many features that under normal circumstances you would not expect from the camera. <br><br>  The flash could have been external, like the NX1000, but I think the developers focused on the camera's mobility and therefore did not embed a ‚Äúhot shoe‚Äù for a removable flash. <br><br>  Need to take a picture with a flash?  Just click here and the flash will pop up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/553/93e/27b/55393e27b389ac38ccae5ae92310bc79.jpg"><br><br>  Now about the appearance.  The GALAXY Camera is equipped with a 4.8 "display (just like the GALAXY S III), but the hardware buttons have been abolished: the Google OS software button appeared instead. <br><br>  In the lower part there are the speaker grilles and a tripod hole.  A battery, a microSD card slot, a USIM slot and even an HDMI connector are also located at the bottom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6f7/076/888/6f7076888d5241c5f2fc457a8a00adf3.jpg"><br><br>  Compared to other cameras of the same class, the GALAXY Camera looks much thinner with an optical 21x zoom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c11/cf5/c99/c11cf5c9962a50ec2f9c94633011b665.jpg"><br><br>  Especially good, the GALAXY Camera showed itself while shooting in the dark. <br><br>  A 1650 mAh battery can be enough for users who intend to use only smartphone functions.  But if you are going to shoot frequently on camera, this may not be enough.  In this case, you will need to take care of an external battery or several auxiliary batteries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/193/ce6/c89/193ce6c8960ecbfe76e4ec4ca870f3b1.jpg"><br><br>  From the right side of the camera (if you hold it to your display - approx. Lane), you can find a headphone jack, microUSB and a strap hole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/81a/f05/439/81af05439790b09ac1a343473fbbd830.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="ff0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">GALAXY Camera vs. GALAXY S III</font> </h2><br>  Let's take a look at some details of the comparison of the GALAXY Camera and the GALAXY S III. <br><br>  As for the screen size, the angular shapes of the GALAXY Camera create the illusion that the display is larger, while the more organic design of the GALAXY S III creates the opposite impression, despite the same size in both cases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a1f/8ee/cde/a1f8eecde51056a3a072edca6bf5ed7b.jpg"><br><br>  GALAXY Camera is equipped with Jelly Bean firmware.  Recently GALAXY S III also received an update to version 4.1. <br><br>  Specifications are the same on both devices, and the amount of RAM depends on your device and where it was purchased. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a3d/630/8b8/a3d6308b8db6be566aac0f5fa62a86fb.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="00a8ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Can I call with the GALAXY Camera?</font> </h2><br>  As you can see in the photo, the text message and phone call icons are missing on the device‚Äôs desktop, and you will not be able to make calls from it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1ec/e6e/f19/1ece6ef19d58307e1ef1d9dc4d3a82bc.jpg"><br><br>  But there is one exception: the GALAXY Camera has a microphone and a speaker, and in combination with an internet connection, calls via VOIP protocols are possible. <br><br>  Now that we've touched the basics, you probably want to know more about the capabilities of the camera? <br><br>  The big advantage of the GALAXY Camera is that it is both an intuitive Android OS device and a serious camera when required. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff9c00">‚ñå Camera</font> <font color="000000">operation</font> </h2><br>  Touching the button above puts the device into camera mode.  You can touch the screen to capture an image as it does on a smartphone, but you can also use the hardware shutter button at the top of the device, like on a regular camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7be/827/74a/7be82774a0261e4c5bcccae3a3ff5a46.jpg"><br><br>  Next to the shutter button is the adjustment of the approximation. <br><br>  The camera offers a variety of shooting modes, including Auto, Casual, Smart Pro and expert modes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/379/a33/b29/379a33b29190ea6ba600fded8f3a8a15.jpg"><br><br>  P / A / S / M modes are responsible for the choice of aperture, shutter speed, ISO values, etc. First of all, it is much more convenient and not as cumbersome as on ordinary cameras, and secondly, the settings allow even beginners to do professional level photos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/05c/801/1b8/05c8011b8affb4ace6127a875a15b9cc.jpg"><br><br>  Various filters, which I had the honor to evaluate previously in GALAXY S III, were further developed in the GALAXY Camera.  In the photo you can see some of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1fb/f2f/0d5/1fbf2f0d596838bd3e9e3d48f5446b34.jpg"><br><br>  Smart Pro mode provides extensive processing capabilities to give your photo more vivid colors and clarity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/406/6ad/a51/4066ada5109dfb9b2c6cfa9182b5d4da.jpg"><br><br>  The camera provides many great features that even experienced camera users will be interested in trying out.  In particular, the ‚ÄúLight Trail‚Äù function will be easy for ordinary users to master. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d6e/89e/8e3/d6e89e8e35a7ffe9fa0f38bdfd78a34f.jpg"><br><br>  Another interesting feature of this camera is the ability to automatically recognize faces.  That's right: as soon as you took one photo of a friend, you can easily share with him subsequent photos of him, because the camera will already know him "by sight"! <br><br>  And for those of you who want to return to the basics, of course, there is a camera guide. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4d2/03e/13b/4d203e13b5a94b167b6576194d3b3ab1.jpg"><br><br>  The motion recognition functions that were previously presented in the GALAXY series are also implemented in the new camera in the form of a zoom.  Once you learn all the gestures with which you can control the camera, it will become even easier to use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d6/08d/5dd/3d608d5dd6a84c99b392c558a53fe6a9.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="0c00ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Opportunities</font> </h2><br>  Even more surprising is the fact that the GALAXY Camera can replace the camera that you already have.  Do not be afraid of anything: despite the fact that I used the device for only 20 minutes, the camera performance exceeded all my expectations. <br><br>  Of course, a larger sensor size provides better image quality than conventional smartphones can provide, while the BSI sensor makes it much easier to take pictures in the dark. <br><br>  In addition, there is an entertainment moment in working with this device: after you have received the perfect picture, you can view it on the smartphone screen and download it to your social network.  network or cloud storage service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/783/704/03d/78370403db39feb04d37b98f4283feda.jpg"><br><br>  In GALAXY Camera already have a pre-installed application for the most popular social.  Instagram network.  You can also not be afraid of losing your photos, because there are cloud-based applications for automatic backup.  And finally, 50GB of free space on Dropbox is provided by default. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/417/dfa/200/417dfa200ac2dca497bc23cb060b4fc4.jpg"><br><br>  When you take a lot of photos and want to share them with friends, you will need to review them again.  It seems that device designers for the device have spent a lot of time to bring the functions and possibilities of the gallery to maximum ease of use and display your best pictures at the touch of a button.  Particularly convenient are the sorting functions and the fact that the GALAXY Camera remembers the faces of your friends. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/753/f0d/b00/753f0db001ab55a041a679aab8a9c091.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="00ff33">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Examples of photographs received</font> </h2><br>  We have reached the part that everyone is postponing for later - uploading photos.  GALAXY Camera makes it quite simple.  You can upload your photos to cloud services or transfer them to a PC using a USB cable.  In PTP mode, the PC recognizes the camera immediately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bbf/dd4/5af/bbfdd45affcde98a31dc872b1de753e8.jpg"><br><br>  Below you can see some pictures that I took in arbitrary P and S modes.  So that you could see the real results of the camera, I did not do any post-processing of photos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6da/9a5/311/6da9a53116b2399fdeda8cb9970a076d.jpg"><br><br>  PS: even more examples of photos in different modes and lighting conditions can be viewed here: <b><u><a href="http://global.samsungtomorrow.com/%3Fp%3D19147">Tyk!</a></u></b> <br><br>  Detailed characteristics are presented <b><u><a href="http://www.samsung.com/ru/microsite/galaxycamera/specifications.html">HERE</a></u></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158445/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158445/</a></p>
