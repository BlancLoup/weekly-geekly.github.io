  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to answer the question: "How much does a website cost?"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is probably one of the most popular questions asked by potential customers. <br><br>  At the first meeting, you explain to the client that websites, like cars, are very different.  And the price is very dependent on its needs and financial capabilities. <br><br>  But it is rather difficult to name the final amount when the TK is not written yet and it is not completely clear what the client wants. <br>  To write detailed and good TZ, not being sure that the contract will be signed in the end is not profitable.  For this is wasted time.  Time is money. <br>  It turns out a double-edged sword. 
      <br>

      As we tried to solve this problem: <br>  (we are talking about an average web-studio) <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  First TK - then the contract </h5><ol><li>  The client fills in a sufficiently detailed application form for the development of the site. </li><li>  On the basis of the questionnaire and personal conversation, a preliminary calculation is made. </li><li>  If the approximate amount of the client suits, then proceed to the preparation of TK.  You understand that for a certain site it is possible to paint everything in a day, and for some it will take two weeks to closely communicate with the customer.  Depending on the scale and needs. </li><li>  When the TZ is ready, we recalculate, we remove something, if the amount is too big for the client, we sign the contract and start working. </li></ol>  The layout is ideal for the customer.  Already at the stage of signing, he clearly understands what he will receive for his money, and what his website will be like. <br>  But it is not very convenient for the performer: not all after paragraph 3 agree to work and sign the contract. <br>  And the time spent on the preparation of TK, you will not return. <br><br><h5>  First the contract - then the TK </h5><ol><li>  We made an even more detailed questionnaire to maximize the possible "pitfalls" </li><li>  Based on the questionnaire call a more accurate amount. </li><li>  We sign a contract that contains clauses of the following nature: <br>  - after drawing up and signing the technical assignment, it becomes an integral part of the contract <br>  - by additional agreement, estimates may be made for additional.  work </li><li>  More carefully and thoughtfully we make TZ (the client is already ‚Äúour‚Äù). </li></ol>  For the studio, the advantages are obvious: all work on the project is paid. <br>  But the customer does not like this scheme, because he does not understand what he pays for and what he will receive in the end. <br><br><h5>  Those.  project - contract - TK </h5><ol><li>  All the same profile + personal meeting. </li><li>  We voice the approximate cost.  If satisfied - go to step 3 </li><li>  On the basis of the questionnaire + meetings, in a day or two we draw up a document - a ‚Äútechnical project‚Äù, where the essence of the future site is described in <b>very</b> general words. </li><li>  If necessary, change and agree on the total amount. </li><li>  We sign a contract similar to the previous one, with the addition of: <br>  - The technical task is made within the framework of the technical project and cannot contradict it. </li><li>  Next TK and go :) </li></ol>  Customers like the scheme, but we don‚Äôt like it very much. <br>  Anyway, before starting work it is difficult to foresee <b>everything</b> .  And customers are often very reluctant to agree on surcharges and recalculations. <br><br>  The ideal scheme has not yet been invented :) <br><br>  And how do you solve this problem? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59993/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59993/</a></p>
