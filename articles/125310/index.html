  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Startup Genome Report translated into Russian!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to share useful material, namely, the translation of the <a href="http://startupgenome.cc/">Startup Genome Report</a> .  Startup Genome is an analytical project whose main task was to systematize, model and find the main key points of the success of startups and the reasons for their failures. <br>  The project was developed with the participation of business accelerators Silicon Valley and their experts. <br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/ne/pg/fd_2011/startupGenome.jpg" align="right" alt="image"><br>  The report has a lot of diverse and interesting graphs and analytics, derived from information from more than 600 startups. <br><br>  The translation was carried out by the <a href="http://freshle.com/">Freshle Startup Community</a> - our educational project on Internet entrepreneurship. <br>  An introductory video of what it is, can be viewed <a href="http://freshle.com/freshle-translations/startupgenomerussian/">here</a> . <br>  <b>And the <a href="http://freshle.com/freshle-translations/startupgenomerussian/">Startup Genome Report Russian Version</a> is also posted there.</b> <br><br>  <b>Some interesting findings</b> : <br><a name="habracut"></a><ul><li>  Founders who study are more successful: Startups that have helping mentors, effectively track quantitative indicators and learn from ideological leaders, attract 7 times more investment and 3.5 times more new users. </li><li>  Startups that make a U-turn (reboot, sudden forced change of business concept) once or twice, earn 2.5 times more money, have an increase in the number of users 3.6 times higher and 52% less likely to premature scaling than startups that unfold more twice or not at all. </li><li>  Many investors invest 2‚Äì3 times more capital than necessary in startups that have not yet achieved readiness to solve the problem of the market they were oriented towards.  They also invest too much in single-player founders and teams without technical founders, despite indicators showing that such teams are much less likely to succeed. </li><li>  Investors who provide direct assistance have little or no effect on the efficiency of the company.  But the right mentors (experts) significantly influence the company's work and its ability to earn money. </li><li>  Single founders take 3.6 times more time to reach the scaling stage compared to companies founded by 2 people, and their probability of making a turn at the right time is 2.3 times less. </li><li>  The founding teams, consisting mainly of businessmen, with a probability of 6.2 times higher successfully pass the scaling stage, if the driving force of a startup is sales, compared to product-oriented startups. </li><li>  The founding teams consisting mainly of ‚Äútechies‚Äù, with a probability of 3.3 times higher, successfully enter the expansion stage if a startup is product-oriented without a core value in the sales system than a product-oriented startup that only has the value built sales system. </li><li>  Balanced teams consisting of one founder - a businessman, and the second - ‚Äútechie‚Äù earn 30% more money, have users 2.9 times more growth and their probability of prematurely entering the expansion stage is 19% less than that of teams consisting of mostly businessmen or "techies". </li><li>  The driving force behind the most successful founders is the momentum (the desire and ability to influence the market), not experience or money. </li><li>  Before the product meets the market, the founders overestimate the value of their intellectual property by 255% </li><li>  Startup companies need 2-3 times more time to understand their market and niche than the founders of the company expect.  This underestimation creates pressure and causes premature scaling. </li><li>  Startups that have not yet attracted investment overestimate the size of their market 100 times and often incorrectly assume that their market segment is new. </li><li>  Premature scaling is the most common reason that startups start to work worse.  They lose the battle too soon, jumping higher than their heads. </li><li>  Dividing Internet startups into B2C (business client) and B2B (business-to-business) no longer matters, as the Internet has changed the rules of business.  It found 4 main different groups with different behaviors regarding customer service, time, product, market and team. </li></ul>

      The translation was made in version 1.0, so various kinds of typos and errors are not excluded, even though we tried to avoid them.  We will be glad to receive your constructive comments, although we do not promise quick fixes, since we have already spent a lot of time on this matter)) Many terms like pivot have no analogs in Russian, therefore they picked them up as best they could. <br><br>  And here, for those who are too lazy to read, there is a <a href="http://freshle.com/wiki/index.php/Startup_Genome_Report_Infographic">generalizing infographics</a> , but in English. <br><br>  Material can be shared anywhere and with anyone, provided that its content and reference to the source are preserved.  We hope our efforts will not be in vain and you will find this material interesting)) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125310/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125310/</a></p>
