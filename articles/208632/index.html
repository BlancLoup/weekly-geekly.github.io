  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RiderEcall is the commercial equivalent of ECall (and ERA-GLONASS) for motorcyclists. Epitaph</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I hope there is no point in explaining to the readers of this section - what is ERA-GLONASS and the European equivalent - ECall.  However, neither ECall nor ERA provide for the rescue of drivers of two-wheeled vehicles.  Although the number of mototourists is growing rapidly, and the developed road network allows you to climb where help from people passing by can wait no less than the Siberian wilds.  Lack of attention to bikers by the officials tried to fill the commercial project RiderEcall, unfortunately, already ceased to exist.  The RiderEcall developers took into account the maximum of possible situations and created a rather interesting technical system and organizational structure.  What you read is an attempt to restore the operating principles of the RiderEcall technical part using fragmentary information and previously downloaded files (for example, the terminal configuration program), and also explain the reasons for its commercial collapse. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first mention of the project relates to 2012.  The latter disappeared from the official pages at the end of 2013.  In general terms, the principle of the system does not differ from the "official" systems: the sensors record the fact of an accident, the terminal transmits the coordinates via the cellular communication to the dispatcher, the dispatcher tries to contact the client, and if the connection is not possible, or the client clearly hints that he is already a patient. the ambulance will leave him (or take off by helicopter).  The differences are in another data transfer channel (usual GPRS), subscription fee (it was about 25 euros per month) and a different principle of determining the fact of an accident from a car. <br>  The project was the fruit of the interaction of four companies: <br>  - Bj√∂rn Steiger Stiftung - a private medical company operating on the insurance principle, provides services throughout Germany.  In the project - provided dispatching and the provision of ambulance medical services. <br>  - Deutsche Telekom - needs no introduction, the largest operator in the country.  In the project - provides cellular communication according to a special tariff plan. <br>  - BOSCH - in the project acts as a manufacturer of a device mounted on a motorcycle. <br>  - Schuberth - manufacturer of motorcycle and other helmets.  Most likely - the initiator of the project.  As well as a manufacturer specially developed for the project version of the helmet with an electronic communication device. <br>  Consider in detail the role of the latter in the list of companies. <br>  Having taken on the role of the engine in the RiderEcall project, Schuberth has reserved for itself an economic niche: the manufacturer of the key element, without which the project is impossible. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/872/d5d/4db/872d5d4dbf270034c9d51f4da45e74f4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The system includes a helmet device as a mandatory part of it.  This device, in fact, is a Bluetooth-headset with limited functionality.  Namely - the establishment of voice communication with a user who is likely to be involved in an accident.  In addition, a measurement is made of the distance of the helmet from a device mounted on a motorcycle (obviously, by signal strength).  However, the dispatcher's dialogue with the user could well be replaced by pressing (or non-pressing) the ‚ÄúEnd Alarm‚Äù button.  It seems that the use of specialized motorcycle helmets is undertaken solely for commercial reasons, in order to gain a foothold in the project as the exclusive supplier of technical solutions. <br>  In addition to increasing the cost of the kit, this solution has other, less obvious flaws, those that are noticeable only to motorcyclists, but more on that later. <br>  It is somewhat incomprehensible why it was necessary to involve as a participant in Deutsche Telekom, probably, this is just an advertising move, because it was enough just to agree on the provision of SIM-cards and communication services with any operator. <br>  Participation in the project of the BOSCH company, as mentioned above, was reflected in the creation of a device mounted on the steering wheel of a motorcycle. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/330/e77/721/330e77721fc0efb35463a866770dd1e0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  If you read the now inaccessible instruction on the Web, you will find that it requires an indispensable installation in a certain position, which is not always possible for a number of motorcycles, and spoils the exterior of the vehicle, which is so important for motorcyclists.  At least Y axis is strictly exposed, for accurate measurement of rolls.  This indicates insufficient development of the internal software.  A more serious attitude to the development would allow installing the device anywhere and as you like. <br>  The fact of an accident is determined by the readings of accelerometers and speed from a GPS receiver.  While the project pages were available - the authors mentioned certain combinations of indicators that uniquely indicate an accident.  As any motorcyclist is aware, an accident is not necessarily associated with a sharp slowdown.  In fact, the motorcyclist may fall, and the motorcycle will stabilize and continue to move, followed by a smooth stop and collapse.  After all, any motorcycle is essentially a collection of gyroscopes (mostly wheels, but engine and transmission parts also play a role).  On the other hand, for some classes of motorcycles, the fall itself is not something special.  More important than the circumstances of this fall. <br>  It can be assumed that the developers took into account the speed at which the fall occurred, and also took into account the possibility of "sawing" the motorcycle into a removable obstacle (for example, in a passenger compartment cell), at which there is no fall to the side. <br>  So, it suffices, with this set of sensors, the following list of situations being worked out: <br>  1. a sharp deceleration along any axis, which is obviously many times greater than the capabilities of the brake systems, regardless of other indications, since  it is incompatible with the capabilities of the body. <br>  2. separation of a helmet and a motorcycle at a motorcycle speed above zero (surely it was necessary to confirm the fact of movement in the form of characteristic signals from accelerometers, in order to eliminate errors) <br>  3. dropping a motorcycle (roll) at a more limiting angle at a speed above the safe threshold. <br>  As you can see, ERA and ECall can only work out the first situation, i.e.  with motorcycles the task is complicated many times.  Especially when you consider that falls can be fatal even when the bike is standing still. <br>  On the other hand, the terminal is simplified due to the fact that a ‚Äúmillisecond solution‚Äù is not required, as in D-Air systems - a motorcyclist's jacket with an airbag controlled via a radio channel from a device mounted on a motorcycle.  There, accelerometers are mounted on the front fork, near the axis, in order to obtain extremely prompt data on the onset of deformation after impact. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89d/55d/108/89d55d108e6e7dd4eccd13567f147552.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In conclusion, a few words about the causes of the collapse of the project.  Of course, we can only guess, but some facts cannot be ignored. <br>  What are Schuberth products?  These are quite expensive motorcycle helmets, presented even in Germany not in all points of sale.  For example, of the two largest chains of motorcycle accessories, Polo and Louis, only Louis is selling Schuberth helmets.  In addition, you need to know the psychology of motorcyclists - many will never buy a product of a particular brand, or vice versa, they will buy certain brands over and over again.  A motorcycle for a wealthy citizen is, first of all, a way of expressing his individuality, and this is exactly what the industry works for.  European motorcyclists, unlike Russian, do not drive without helmets at all and in principle.  But quite often neglect the rest of the elements of motorcycle equipment.  Thus, a helmet for them remains the only means of expression, except for the motorcycle itself.  Making the German motorcyclist not only buy a single brand, but also a single model, with a very limited choice of design and colors, is a very difficult task. <br>  Further, such a device makes the helmet heavier, degrading one of its main parameters, which serves as a criterion for high manufacturability and attractiveness of the product. <br>  Also, the disadvantages of the German project include the absence of additional geo-services that increase the attractiveness of the system. <br>  In general, the opinion of the Russian motor community about the prospects of such a project in Russia is rather negative.  Motorcycle is associated with freedom, and GPS (and even more so GLONASS) - with surveillance.  Motorcyclists are more responsive than motorists and have more reason to rely on their comrades than electronic devices.  According to its founder, Pavel Soskov, the time of ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù calls (not from road accident participants, but from passersby) in the system of voluntary mutual assistance ‚ÄúMotositizen‚Äù does not exceed 10 minutes, but on average it takes 3-5 minutes. <br>  Most likely, it is early to write the final version of the epitaph to the RiderEcall project.  It is quite possible that he will still be reborn, perhaps his elements will sometime become part of ECall, when (and if) European officials will attend to the rescue of motorcyclists. </div>
