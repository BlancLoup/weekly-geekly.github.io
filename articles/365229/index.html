It is not that my work or personal life depends on his direct presence, but this apparatus greatly facilitates both these aspects. <br><br>  To date, my companion is Galaxy Note 4 (hereinafter referred to as "the device") from the Korean manufacturer Samsung.  Further, purely personal impressions will go not only from owning this device, but also the user cases that accompany me and this smartphone every day.

      The description will be conducted in simple human language, if possible, avoiding technical terms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2bc/0a7/e44/2bc0a7e44c614491a036b9b595b26764.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  <b>Design</b> </h5><br>  Almost all devices are now very similar.  Let me explain, people usually use only the front side and the keys on the edges of the device.  This means that people do not see anything except the glass screen at the time of using the smartphone.  In this regard, Note 4 is just a big black screen (until the display is activated). <br><br>  Many will say that color, ryushech and the presence / absence of distracting inscriptions on the front are important.  For me, people don't see them as soon as they start working with the device. <br><br>  Want to see the design?  Then it is necessary to turn the devices in your hands, this means that you stop using it and start to admire it. <br>  There is something to admire.  If you start to turn in the hands of Note 4, then immediately the metal frame throughout the device is striking.  This is not just an answer to the annual ‚Äúagain at the Samsung plastic / slippery remnant / I even have a hundred-year-old Nokia and more metal!‚Äù And similar remarks.  Here the frame still plays a strengthening role.  Having dropped the device, there is a small possibility that he will survive this fall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/282/d4e/8c8/282d4e8c899d4998be22ffde87c06d4c.jpg" alt="image /"><br><br>  And yes, the frame does not bend!  But with an effort, you can scratch, apply chipping.  I did not notice, and suddenly a dent appeared, but the frame did not lose its structure. <br><br>  The frame is additionally covered with paint, the color depends on the color of the device.  On white - the frame is covered with white, on black - black, on gold - green (in fact, of course not). <br><br>  The back cover of the device is plastic, made "under the skin."  Koreans have shown such work with plastic since Note 3. I can't help saying that even the company's refrigerators can boast with this bun.  REFRIGERATORS, Karl!  It is possible that such "skin" plastic is used by the company somewhere else. <br><br><h5>  <b>Opportunities</b> </h5><br>  The first and main application of this device is an electronic book.  And about this directly indicates the inscription "Note" in the title.  Who does not know, this smartphone comes with the S Pen stylus. <br><br>  At work, quite often one has to write something down in a hurry: tasks, plan for the day, notes, notes, phone numbers, names and addresses, etc. and so on.  Before the appearance in the ranks of this unit, good old notebook and pen were used.  By occupation, notebooks quickly ended, ink pens were depleted.  Therefore, the decision to purchase exactly Note was deliberate - an electronic notebook with a pen.  Moreover, I have previously (not directly to him, but in the past) already had experience using this line of smartphones - Note, Note II, Note 3. <br><br>  Work has become easier.  All notes are divided into 2 types - quick (action memo) and regular (notes). <br><br>  My quick notes usually contain various instant notes.  In a smartphone, they are stored in one container and can be sorted only by date and background color. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d6a/4bc/b2c/d6a4bcb2c1f84a69ba2287e1e1715d0f.png" alt="image /"><br><br>  Regular entries may already contain a name, a geotag, a time, a tag.  Each such record is kept as a separate notebook with its own cover, page template (empty, daily routine, lines, cells and top similar templates, which can be further expanded by loading from the general storage in the cloud), the number of pages.  In such electronic notebooks, I lead separate projects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/039/7f7/e56/0397f7e5653549b0ab8a80fbc867a079.png" alt="image /"><br><br>  In the notebook for the project, you can enter as a drawing text from the pen, and electronic, printed on-screen keyboard.  They can contain pictures, photos, audio recordings, and more.  You can keep various graphs and charts. <br><br>  All notes are synchronized with your Evernote account, so any entry can be accessed from a computer.  Another thing is that you can only edit them on a smartphone. <br><br>  Thanks to the drawing set, you can even try your luck in writing any masterpiece.  For those to whom this set is not enough - you can download already semi-professional and professional applications.  Together with a pen you can get great results. <br><br>  On the pen in the device tied a lot of functions.  In order to familiarize yourself with the main ones, simply remove the pen from the slot, as the context menu of the radial opens with a choice of actions with the pen.  I do not use all of these functions, because I need a pen for a specific purpose ‚Äî record keeping, so the pen doesn‚Äôt leave its convenient opening without good reason. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b70/183/3f4/b701833f42524b4da54c30860d5715a1.jpg" alt="image /"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a0/3a2/b39/6a03a2b39fc54848ae5bca403b6e2eec.png" alt="image /"><br><br>  It is quite successful that a fingerprint scanner is embedded in this device - you need to protect your notes, and, in general, private information as a whole.  They write that Samsung uses a completely inconvenient scanner in comparison with Apple's Cupertin, where it is enough to read a finger to read a print.  In Note 4 (as well as in S5), in order to read a print, you need to slide your finger over the Home button (it is the only button on the front side of the device).  I did not compare the work of these two systems, but I can say that this function works fine in the device, if configured correctly.  In Android 5.0, the Smart Lock function appeared when the device is not locked under certain conditions, such as connecting to bluetooth, staying in a trusted zone (work / home). <br><br>  I have a dangling bracelet attached to the device on my hand, so the device is always unlocked next to me.  As soon as the connection with the bracelet is lost, the smartphone immediately turns on the fingerprint lock.  The same situation is configured with a trusted home zone.  And it is very convenient.  I am glad that the Koreans did not cut this function from the firmware, as they do with many of the functions presented in android.  Tachvizyat, in other words. <br><br><h5>  <b>Screen</b> </h5><br>  To create and consume content on the device, a good screen is also needed.  Here he is gorgeous.  I am not an ardent expert in this field and have not made any measurements with a colorimeter, but the screen is very, very suitable for recording, viewing video and text.  There will be too many diagonal screens of 5.7 ‚Äù, for sure there will be those for whom such a diagonal will be missed.  But the fact is that it is very convenient to work with such a screen size.  After all, it is for this need and take a series of devices Galaxy.  Those who justify his purchase by the desire to draw and develop in this direction, in my opinion, should take a bigger screen - tablets for this purpose are the thing.  Even better, of course, canvas, brush and watercolor, but this is the lyrics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0f/fb1/68e/b0ffb168e3be4bb69888774333896880.jpg" alt="image /"><br><br>  I am one of those who in no way justifies the appearance of a 2K screen in Note 4. 1080p was enough even on Note 3 with the same screen diagonal.  2K screen manufacturer justifies supposedly better readability of the text in the browser, a clearer picture as a whole.  But I do not see the difference with 1080p, well, no. <br><br>  I am not interested in viewing angles, as I almost always use the device perpendicularly to my eyes - I look at the screen at a right angle, but it's fair to say that the angles are fine. <br><br>  The color rendition can be customized.  There are color profiles that will suit any user.  The blessing of SuperAMOLED screen here is to this. <br><br><h5>  <b>Camera</b> </h5><br><br>  Excellent, fast and versatile camera.  16 megapichels, instant HDR for photo and video.  Photos with sufficient lighting are excellent.  On the screen of the smartphone, which, I repeat, excellent, the resulting pictures look bright, rich, high-quality.  With the video - the same situation.  In low light, the picture is quite different, but better than, say, in 2012 and earlier.  I do not use the advanced settings when shooting, i.e.  I do not change the ISO, white balance and other levers, I just do not turn off the Auto + HDR mode and I am more than fully satisfied with this state of affairs.  An exception can be called cases when you want to play with the settings, but such Wishlist appear rarely. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/732/553/223/732553223a49474bad61780880a73e20.png" alt="image /"><br><br>  There is a lack of a separate button for launching the camera, for example, on Sony / Nokia devices, but this is a disaster for almost all other manufacturers and there‚Äôs no getting away from it.  Interestingly entered the Galaxy S6 - double clicking on the Home button starts the camera.  If you are lucky, then this, undoubtedly, a convenient bun will be delivered in future firmware for Note 4. <br><br>  In general, I think that the race for cameras in flagship quality has long been over.  Now the focus is on the ryushechki in the interface, additional buns in the form of slow motion, shooting with the ability to change the focus and other, usually unnecessary, joys.  Honestly, it is better and more convenient to have a camera interface from HTC (compared with HTC One M8).  Everything is convenient, fast and affordable.  In the camera Note 4, for additional shooting modes, you need to download the module for the camera from your own app store. <br><br><h5>  <b>Performance</b> </h5><br>  Here it is right over the edge.  I do not play on the phones, do not drive and do not measure the results in benchmarks.  The range of applications I use is limited to the office suite plus social networks.  Surely, if I install some very demanding new toys - they will work without problems. <br>  Quite an interesting situation came out with the name of the processor model - Exynos 7433, 8 cores: 4 super smart for handling complex tasks and 4 weak ones for simple calculations.  At the presentation, and before the release itself, this processor was named none other than Exynos 5433, the 5th generation company's own processor.  Then, the company somehow imperceptibly changed his tsiferka from 5 to 7, so that a more solid Exynos 7433 came out. Why?  Only Koreans understand. <br><br>  The processor described by me is supplied exactly in the country where I bought it - Kazakhstan.  A model with a similar processor is shipped to Russia and other countries. <br><br>  There is a variation with the processor on the Snapdragon 805, it has some kind of pumped LTE mode, it is higher in the category.  This processor, in difference from 910C (Exynos, 8 cores), is 4-core. <br><br>  In practice, the model on Exynos also has LTE support, so far we have practically nowhere to use it.  But I purchased a SIM card of a local sole provider that provides mobile Internet using this technology.  Speed, I tell you, well, just gorgeous.  At my home on the wired internet is not always possible to get such speeds.  What limited me in switching to an operator is an inconvenient tariff, even a very inconvenient one.  Let me have a leaky and barely working 3G, but the tariff for communication suits me more. <br><br>  In order not to poke fingers specifically do not call the operators.  Surely 4G (LTE) in Russia is better and more common, plus it is flavored with good support for mobile tariffs from operators.  We, the people of Kazakhstan, still have to live and live. <br><br>  UPD: <br>  Before the introduction in the country, MNP decided to pamper itself with the real mobile Internet.  I put an LTE-compatible operator SIM card and included the redirection of all calls from the old number.  Mobile life has changed. <br><br><h5>  <b>Shell</b> </h5><br>  I admit that all the android devices that I had before were always stitched with custom firmware (CM, AOKP and the like), customized with official ones.  I always finished them for my own needs, gave an appearance that would suit me - an esthete lives in me regarding the design of the work area in electronic counterparts. <br><br>  Perhaps due to age or simple ordinary human laziness, I stopped doing it.  The previous device I had was the HTC One M8 and there, after significant experiments with flashing everything and everything, I returned the official stock firmware and did not even install the root / custom recovery rights.  I just used it as it is and that's it, since the interface and the overall work of the smartphone‚Äôs firmware didn‚Äôt have to change this situation. <br><br>  After the acquisition of Note 4, my first thought after switching on was to put the root as quickly as possible, remove ALL rubbish with which Samsung clogs its smartphones, change the interface here and there, and even change the color gamut, which is here, by default, just well, very scary, and well, very strange.  Let me explain, the screen here is made using SuperAMOLED technology, i.e.  When displaying a picture with a larger amount of black, less battery power is consumed.  On Habr√© even saw an article where this effect was proven.  Save up to 30%, proof - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/161559/">habrahabr.ru/post/161559</a> . <br><br>  In Samsung, knowing its technology, deliberately outlines the themes of their smartphones, with the AMOLED screen, so bright that it completely kills the entire logic of installing AMOLED technology displays.  Where is the logic?  All menus are white, regular applications also use white colors to the maximum.  The settings screen is generally a white background with text and icons on it. <br><br>  This situation is on Android 4.4 and on Android 5.0 in the Samsung version.  The only explanation I see is Google‚Äôs claim, but have the Koreans ever considered the opinion of a good corporation regarding design?  Google Nexus is an exception. <br><br>  As expected, not only I think this way, but also users of the XDA Forums resource, where various firmware, themes, modifications for various devices from many manufacturers are regularly laid out.  Virtually any manufacturer cant decide enthusiasts of this resource, by making changes to the system files.  I met the resource back in 2010, when I acquired my first android smartphone. <br><br><h5>  <b>Battery</b> </h5><br>  An additional reason for the demolition of the official firmware / changes in it was the very weak energy efficiency of the device.  I only have enough charge for a day of use, much more often - even less.  On this occasion, even appealed to the service center, but there, after a couple of days of tests, the problem was not confirmed.  The explanation in my case is a bad cellular connection that pulls the juice out of the battery.  My operator, as they explained to me, optimized the network very poorly, with other operators there is no such problem.  Of course, I decided to check it out, and, oh, a miracle, this turned out to be true, though not so obvious.  The transfer of the network from 3G to 2G gives an increase in battery life to idle about 50%.  Those.  for the night, about 3-4% of the battery is eaten, with data transfer disconnected.  With 3G (or automatic selection of the network mode) about 10-15% will fly away.  But as soon as you turn on the waffle or data transfer, about 20% fly away overnight. <br><br>  It is not excluded a bad optimization of the modem in the device.  I'm not the first and not the only one who faced such a problem, on the well-known w3bsit3-dns.com in the power consumption branch, there is still a lot of debate about who managed to squeeze more hours of work from the battery. <br><br>  Basically, they all end when people show their usage scenario.  Someone completely disables the entire Internet social part of the smartphone, making it just a big dialer with a beautiful screen.  Someone on the contrary, leaves almost every function included and puts up with the operation of the device from morning to evening.  Others simply remove unnecessary applications, setting up the firmware of the device for themselves.  I am one of them.  But in my case it does not really help, because  My device basically serves for work in the world wide web, therefore the device lives only one light day.  In the morning I took off the charge, at night from 10-15% I put on charging again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a9/74b/be1/9a974bbe1d5e4a9597de29d52977675a.png" alt="image /"><br><br>  Surely, the excessively high resolution of the screen, 2K, is also very bad for the operating time of the device. <br><br>  The firmware has a power saving function.  The frequency of the processor, the brightness of the backlight is limited, the vibration is turned off.  If necessary, you can also translate ALL the image rendered by the device into the grayscale style.  Even videos and photos will become gray.  The bad news is that it does not help to save the charge.  You simply will not see a significant increase. <br><br>  The same applies to the mode of extreme energy saving, when the device turns into a touch grandmother's phone.  The set of available applications is limited, the image becomes gray.  The device happily reports that in this mode it will work another day, two, a week.  But no. <br>  It is possible that the above-mentioned modem optimization is affecting the inconspicuous operation of these two modes.  Rainbow estimated hours until the device is completely turned off do not take into account the voracity of the networks of mobile operators. <br><br>  In Note 4, there is a fast charging feature when the battery can be half charged in 30 minutes - fast charging.  It only works with a regular charger.  When such charging works, some kind of magic happens with the supply of electricity to the device - the voltage jumps, if I understand correctly. <br><br>  And if you believe the people who understand this, then it is better to immediately disable this feature in the device itself - this greatly affects the battery life. <br><br><h5>  <b>General impressions</b> </h5><br>  Galaxy Note 4 will hold out with my regular smartphone for a long time (an exception if Note 5 shows something well, quite useful, convenient, practical).  The smartphone is just packed up to the eyeballs with numerous features that I use day by day.  I delete even more of these functions or simply do not use them as unnecessary. <br><br>  I still don‚Äôt see competitors in the apparatus on the market, and I want Koreans not to stop at what has been accomplished and constantly improve the devices of this line, presenting these improvements not only with new devices, but also adding great ideas by updating the firmware to the existing models on the market.  The modern company's flagships have plenty of hardware capabilities. <br><br>  Pluses of the device: <br>  - Luxury screen <br>  - Stylus <br>  - Fingerprint scanner <br>  - Camera <br>  - Performance <br>  - Design <br><br>  Minuses: <br>  - Shell <br>  - Battery </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365229/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365229/</a></p>
