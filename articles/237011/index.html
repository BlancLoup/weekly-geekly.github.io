  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why should we spend money on corporate style ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚ÄúAnd how will the new corporate style affect the company's sales growth?‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúWhy should we spend money on a new style if we are an IT company developing software for the corporate market?‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúWe are developing and selling systems, not the style and design of the company!‚Äù <br>  I think similar phrases have been heard by many who worked in IT. <br>  Typically, this kind of answers are associated with a lack of money, time from management, the lack of people who could take on this project, and many others. Everyone can add to this list from their own experience and taste.  In IT companies of our genre, market features such as B2B and B2G are added, and not the usual B2C.  Accordingly, in our case, the stereotype that we should do and develop a quality product (and nothing more!) Is relevant to anyone. <br>  But it was not there!  Now we are more and more convinced of this by our example. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e46/413/bb1/e46413bb1dbf4415bdc4932a5fa658b4.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The impetus for the rethinking of our appearance was several events: <br>  Event # 1 - For yourself and for the soul.  We are 20 years old, and we want more new ideas (fresh air) in the life of the company. <br>  Event number 2 - We also know how to count money.  At one of the brainstorms of the Marketing Department, we came to the conclusion that we need a document describing our entire corporate style.  This can seriously systematize our work processes. <br>  Bonus event.  When a company has about 250 partners, it is not easy to coordinate the positioning of our brand in regional markets. <br><br>  In general, even having realized these and a number of other difficulties and advantages, for a long time we could not decide on such a courageous step as the start of work in this area.  And finding a company that would have had experience working with IT to develop everything from ZERO was also not so easy.  As a result, on views on IT and life, we met with Studio Ippiart, which took up our quest. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/822/fb4/481/822fb448138a46ffac993427466bee22.jpg"><br>  <b>The task was as follows: ‚ÄúWe must create a brand book for everyone‚Äù</b> <br><habracut><br>  The purpose of the rebranding was a complete update of not only the visual, external, customer-oriented, but also the internal environment in the company.  It forms new corporate standards, with the help of which new software is created, marketing and sales departments work.  The same standards apply to partners and distributors. <br><br><h4>  Who we want to see ourselves in the market </h4><br>  It goes without saying that any brand starts with a company logo, but before it we still had to answer a very important question: what do we want to look like in the market, in the eyes of our customers and partners?  I will not go into all the details of this brainstorming, but I will say that in the end all thoughts were reduced to the following expression <b>‚ÄúThere are two ways - to silently observe how the world changes you, or change yourself to be the first to be the first!‚Äù</b> <b><br></b>  By the time we started work, for a long time, we used a sign in the form of the letters of the company abbreviation inscribed into each other.  The sign was serious, balanced, but at the same time too static and somewhat heavy. <br><habracut><br>  <b>Initially, we considered two options for the development of the sign:</b> <b><br></b>  <b>The first.</b>  Modernization, with preservation of recognizable elements, letters of an abbreviation. <br>  <b>Second.</b>  Creating a fundamentally new sign. <br>  An additional difficulty in the development was the requirement to create a logo in Russian and English.  Our friends from Studio Ippiart selected for us several fonts with which both versions of the logo looked organic. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da1/72f/a6e/da172fa6e42f449ea7a5381f6902c4d2.jpg"><br>  <i>Search for sign shape upgrade</i>

      By the way, in our case, the development stage of the logo was the most difficult and long in the whole way of creating a new corporate style for the company.  When developing it, I had to think about everything at once: about the brand book, about all the materials and resources that the logo will ultimately affect.  After all, the company logo is its cornerstone, which determines the future of style and brand. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7f/bc5/70b/b7fbc570bbb84924b60b20108b2f9a6c.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/257/432/599/257432599843485480c329d311007ab9.png"><br>  <i>Evaluated how logos can look on food boxes, website, etc.</i> <i><br></i> <br><habracut><br>  The first proposed version of the mark was a paper airplane, stylized as a mouse cursor.  The abbreviation "EOS" at the same time formed a virtual button, which clicked the cursor-airplane.  The philosophy of this proposal was the rejection of paper, which ceased to be a carrier of information, becoming a subject for games - folding paper airplanes or origami, the motifs of which were used in the design of test product boxes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7f/dd1/e5a/b7fdd1e5aae04377adf1223f15016683.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/173/7e6/751/1737e6751d1e41de898424d7e45da021.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/198/ccc/4f1/198ccc4f1a284b0ea52042272c3e66a0.jpg"><br>  <i>Slides from the presentation of the first version of the logo</i> <br><habracut><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18b/1b6/e80/18b1b6e809d44005a8bf48a817f9f3ee.jpg"><br>  <i>Test logo placement on the box</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d83/88d/c94/d8388dc941f342d5b245b404096f97b5.png"><br>  <i>Looking for new ideas</i> <br><habracut><br>  Later, we developed at least a dozen sentences, including various images: ordered folders for documents, two pyramid triangles facing each other, symbolizing the union of executive and rank-and-file employees, abstract dynamic images, and stylized abbreviations of letters. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e55/2cd/3df/e552cd3df3d84229b745c85d4fe0d7cf.jpg"><br>  <i>Search for a new sign shape</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/027/d9d/37a/027d9d37aac147518a23a929261124d6.png"><br>  <i>What only options we did not have!</i> <br><habracut><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca8/3ba/fce/ca83bafcef4f4906aa3e7a286e3492da.png"><br>  The key decision on the logo came quite unexpectedly: at one of the meetings, President of the EOS company V.E.  Balasanyan accidentally drew attention to one of the sketches drawn by hand, which was not intended to be shown - it was a spiral, dynamically combining the letters "E", "O" and "C".  He proposed to work on this option. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd2/daf/fe0/fd2daffe0d0f4112a1b126c2c85e3c90.jpg"><br>  <i>Sketch on a piece of paper</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/910/34e/772/91034e772a1149aa98392e2dbff33cae.jpg"><br>  <i>Search for EOS "spiral" form</i> <br><habracut><br>  Having painted the sign, the designers of Ippyart Studio offered several color options.  Remembering that in Greek mythology, Eos is the goddess of the morning dawn, they tried to use the colors of the sky and the rising sun - from deep blue to red and bright orange.  As a result, this option was approved. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d16/dab/21f/d16dab21f05d416989d42cdf147887a8.jpg"><br>  <i>Search for color solutions logo</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81b/598/c4f/81b598c4fe7c4142ac3b53e3a0b607f7.jpg"><br>  <i>Test logo placement on the box</i> <br><habracut><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fb/cd5/fc9/8fbcd5fc97c74aca80cbdc750a784fd8.jpg"><br>  <i>A few examples of logo placement and adaptation of the company's website</i> <br><br>  From the brand book: ‚ÄúThe EOS logo is a combination of a bright graphic sign and a text part.  The sign is formed by a dynamic spiral consisting of stylized abbreviation letters of the company.  The spiral symbolizes movement and speed.  Inscribed in a circle and painted in blue, red and amber-yellow, it reminds of the rising sun.  In Greek mythology, Eos is the goddess of the morning dawn. ‚Äù <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b55/a67/920/b55a6792017c49e9860912c12e19e193.jpg"><br>  <i>It was-become</i> <br><br>  In the next article, we, together with our friends from Studio Ippiart, will try to tell you already about the creation of the brand book itself, consisting of: <br>  - 12 product logos that we needed to link with each other and with the company logo; <br>  - presentation templates with dual use in our company; <br>  - numerous leaflets designed to simply and intelligibly tell people about complex IT products; <br>  - grocery box, made in the new format <br>  - and much more ... <br><br>  By the way, we will also talk about the creation of a multi-purpose stand-designer .... <br><habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237011/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237011/</a></p>
