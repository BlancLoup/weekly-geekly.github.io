      There are a large number of scientific works on this topic, especially in the field of medicine and psychology (the use of music in the treatment of patients, the influence of music on various human organs, etc.).  Of course, many studies should be skeptical, as there is a danger of going into pseudoscience, but there are more than enough authoritative works on this subject. <br><br>  On the same Habr√© there are a lot of <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/audiomania/blog/227319/">excellent articles</a> about how music <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/154795/">affects</a> the working climate of the office, the concentration of the employee, etc.  But this material is a little about something else. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have been working as a programmer for five years and have been listening to ambient music for about ten years.  Naturally, I have other preferences among musical genres and trends, but I associate the programming process mainly with ambient (later I will use the Russian designation of the genre).  Nevertheless, this article will be relevant not only for programmers, but also people of other professions, one way or another connected with mental work.  But, before turning to observations of the relationship between ambient music and comfort in programming, I would like to introduce the course of those who do not know this musical direction. <br><br><h4>  Everything you wanted to know, but were afraid to ask about ambient </h4><br>  What is ambient?  Most people are strangers to him.  The most popular genres that are closest to ambient are the lounge or chill out, which can be heard in clubs and on the radio.  Ambient, with all its diversity, is a more experimental direction in which the rhythm itself and the voice parts are most often absent.  In addition, unlike a chill-out, ambient music is usually less melodic. <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582">Wikipedia</a> defines ambient as ‚Äúelectronic music style based on modulations of the sound timbre.  Ambient is often characterized by an atmospheric, enveloping, unobtrusive, background sound. ‚Äù  The definition is true and in general terms describes the features of the genre, but covers not all of its forms with which the most ardent fans of such music are familiar.  In the article, the term ‚Äúambient‚Äù will be used in relation to related styles, such as: Dark Ambient, Space Ambient, soft forms of IDM, etc.  In more detail about genres we will talk further. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f23/f16/13f/f23f1613ffcd49848bb5196ceed0f6cf.png"></div><br>  Ambient often intersects with other genres, and its manifestations, in any case, you have heard somewhere.  A lot of soundtracks for games and movies - pure ambient music.  There are ambient tracks from popular musicians who usually do not work in this genre (for example, Depeche Mode and Radiohead).  You could also hear the ambient in news headlines, in advertising, in the background of audio podcasts, etc.  In other words, you definitely met with this type of music, just do not know about it. <br><br><h4>  Ambient and programming, or how I stopped being afraid and fell in love with ten minute noise tracks </h4><br>  The perception of the surrounding reality is always subjective, especially when it comes to addictions in music.  Therefore, this article is, first of all, my own feelings, which do not necessarily completely coincide with yours.  However, I assume that such an approach to the relationship of music and work may be interesting. <br><br>  In my opinion, programming is an activity that requires our concentration, but not the ultimate stress, on a permanent basis.  Thoughts should flow smoothly, and the process of creating code (ideally) should be calm and conscious.  In principle, the concept of the notorious ‚Äústate of flow‚Äù says the same thing.  Naturally, I understand that there are different cases, and sometimes programmers are aggressive creatures that beat their fists on the keyboard when something goes wrong for them.  But let's consider the option when the work takes place in a quiet mode (by the way, this peace can be achieved just the same at the expense of properly selected music). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c79/b9a/d9e/c79b9ad9ec5449c9aa2621396d17042f.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Writing music on old analog synthesizers is a bit like programming.</i> <br><br>  In my opinion, an important factor for creating a pleasant working atmosphere is to minimize distractions.  That is why during the work I practically cannot listen to music ‚Äúwith words‚Äù, since the perception of the text pulls the attention on itself, which impedes the writing of the code very much.  For me, this is the same as reading a book and listening to the radio at the same time.  Two streams of information are mixed into one, which is why you miss words when reading and lose some audio information. <br><br>  So it is in programming.  Writing code is the same as writing a text: notes or articles.  Sometimes it happens that the words of a song somehow cling to you, you are heard and lose the thought, after which you have to restore your working condition.  Perhaps the ability to perceive several sources of information without such failures can be developed, but why complicate your work?  Therefore, I try not to listen to news and songs while programming. <br><br>  The exception to this rule is forms of ambient, where voice samples are used (recordings of radio broadcasts, excerpts from films and TV shows).  In this case, the voice is embedded in the music so that from the moving element of the track it turns into just one more layer of the musical environment.  From the examples of ambient with voice samples, I can call Boards of Canada, Biosphere, eyesix. <br><br>  Too energetic and dynamic music for writing code is not suitable - in any case, for me.  One gets the feeling that with a fast tempo and a moving rhythm (it doesn't matter if it's electronic music or rock) I try to do the work faster than I need: I want to write code to the beat of the music and absolutely do not want to stop and think.  I think that such an aggressive way of programming can find its amateurs (in fact, this is also in some way the state of flow), but such music helps me more in matters related to physical activity.  For example, dig potatoes under The Prodigy. <br><br><h4>  Creating a mood with ambient music </h4><br>  As I have already said, the influence of music on the emotions and mood of a person, their close relationship has long been known.  If you are having fun, then in headphones you will hear music corresponding to your high spirits.  Or, perhaps, it will be heard from the speakers, conveying your attitude to others (the main thing is not to overdo it with loudness).  If you want to relax, take a break from the worries and fuss of life, it is best to listen to light, calm music.  All this applies to your working condition.  There is even a huge number of albums and playlists (on streaming services) that were created for various types of work activities, including programming.  Ambient music is often included in these selections. <br><br>  Ambient includes many styles, and not all of them are suitable for work.  For example, Dark Ambient, which is characterized by a dark, heavy atmosphere, can lead you to despondency and deprive the vigor necessary for work.  There is also a Drone ambient, consisting mainly of low-frequency buzz - such constant pressure on your ears will not exactly improve your ability to think and write code.  Therefore, I advise you to use light forms of ambient.  Here is a small ‚Äúinstructions for use‚Äù in which you will find what can be heard from such music during work. <br><br>  If you have never listened to ambient, then it is worth starting with simpler types for perception, since a random encounter with too experimental compositions can forever discourage your interest in this genre. <br><br>  In my opinion, residents of the French label Ultimae Records have one of the most pleasant (and understandable) sounds.  This label produces psychedelic ambient music (Psybient or Psy Chill), which contains pleasant melodies, beautiful and smooth structure.  In this genre, the themes of space, both internal and external, are often touched.  I advise you to listen to Solar Fields (he has albums in the trance genre, do not confuse), Carbon Based Lifeforms, Asura. <br><br>  Those who want something more fun, with a small inclusion of rhythm, can turn to ambient house, downtempo and dub ambient.  This music is more positive, more ‚Äúsunny‚Äù.  There is a light rhythm that came from reggae and dub.  I advise you to listen to The Orb, Ott and Future Sound of London. <br><br>  If you go to a more saturated forms of ambient, then you should try ambient techno.  This direction can even be considered as a dance.  The music is built on looped parts of drum machines that are mixed with atmospheric synthesizers.  I strongly advise you to listen to Selected Ambient Works 85-92 from Aphex Twin, The Black Dog, B12.  Separately, I would like to mention such ambient techno musician as the Biosphere - music is very atmospheric, with a special Arctic sound. <br><br>  There is also a classic ambient that is based on the work of several famous composers.  This is an ambient in all its diversity: the forms and shades of music are completely different.  Classical ambient is based on the use of ambient noise and certain analog instruments (for example, old analog synthesizers).  The ‚Äúmain‚Äù name of a classic ambient is Brian Eno.  Actually, it was this musician who coined the term ‚Äúambient‚Äù.  In addition, you can listen to Steve Roach, Robert Rich, Klaus Schulze and Pete Namluk.  Each of them has a huge discography with many works in various styles. <br><br>  There are forms of ambient in which the musical component is minimized.  A vivid example is field recording.  In this genre, the musician does not write music in the conventional sense, but takes a highly sensitive microphone and goes into the woods to record the environment.  This is the most natural music that you can hear.  Of the most famous, we can recommend the Biosphere, listening to which you are transported to the mountains beyond the northern Arctic Circle. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c3/7f1/669/1c37f166972a423e9d36edc25f3a02a0.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Musician Biosphere in its natural environment</i> <br><br><h4>  Finally </h4><br>  Creating a working mood is very important, especially during the programming process, which requires calm and concentration.  I know that each of you writes code for your favorite tunes, which belong to completely different genres, but try to reconsider your view of the relationship between the music around you and the effectiveness of your work.  Try a new approach in creating your environment.  Try writing code for ambient music. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/325484/">https://habr.com/ru/post/325484/</a></p>
