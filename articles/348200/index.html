      People talk a lot about <b>real leaders</b> , but getting to know someone like Sean for more than eight years is completely different.  We both started with the same idea in 2008, even before we met each other.  Sean wanted to make Git scalable for its implementation in the Android OpenSource project and began rewriting the <a href="https://github.com/rietveld-codereview/rietveld">Rietvield</a> project in pure Java, while I had a goal to expand the use of Git in large enterprises around the world using the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DunJxlD2aopY">GitEnterprise.com</a> service. <br><br><h3>  All embracing ideas </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d6/ut/-p/d6ut-pntahho1spilhpmipfzfwm.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  We first met face to face in 2011 on <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2011/12/gittogether-2011.html">GitTogether at Mountain View CA</a> at the Googleplex.  <b>Sean was the initiator of this famous "non-conference"</b> .  This place was an incubator of ideas and creating minds that spent time together to share and enrich each other's experiences with new revolutionary concepts. <br><br>  I was new, and I didn't know anyone on the project.  <i>My ideas were very different from what people discussed in the hall</i> .  Then I got up and, inspired by the experience and success of Jenkins CI, offered to change the architecture of the project and make it fully plug-in. <br><br>  <b>Sean did not have the slightest idea who I was</b> , where I came from, what experience I had and what I was working on: he simply replied: ‚ÄúYes, that makes sense.  Would you like to join in and help us? ‚ÄùI did, we worked together for a week, so began my journey with Sean. <br><br><h3>  Inspiring people </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kb/52/2i/kb522ikhmqrdp-l_i5etjt1njz8.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  What I liked about Sean was his unique <b>project management style</b> .  He never announced or presented himself with a certain pathos at conferences, but everyone knew who he was and when he entered the room, he riveted everyone's attention. <br><br>  He passionately talked about the problems that he faced on the project, and always expanded the boundaries that the project can achieve.  This passion was contagious.  <b>He never told people what to do and still left everyone to make mistakes</b> , which they can learn and improve on. <br><br>  Sean was the <b>seed that made the project grow far ahead beyond its original size and scope</b> .  He was able to take on promising young people, such as Dave Borowitz, who started working as an intern at Google a year ago and allowed him to rewrite the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DyWTvUyvP24M">entire backend for implementing NoteDB</a> . <br><br><h3>  Humanity first </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kb/if/1m/kbif1mtv9fxz_ujuy-qiiqoio5a.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Sean was bright and ingenious, but what inspired me most was his <b>passion for his children and for his loving family</b> .  He is used to the fact that his son comes for the weekend to our Hakatons and is near his father.  He combined his family life with his daily work and passion.  The best moment I remember is when we had a <i>‚Äúhacker barbecue‚Äù at sunset in his new house in San Jose, located opposite the beautiful hills</i> , Noah was playing in the garden and hugging his loving father. <br><br>  He always looked towards the unification of the needs of his family and the presence and responsibilities of the Gerrit project, which remembered everyone, since people are the most important part of it. <br><br><h3>  Devotion </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/db/dd/jx/dbddjxolmezzmxsx-kv_lulvqbs.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Loss of Sean for many people was unexpected: he continued to publish the code and respond to letters to the very last days.  He implemented the new OpenSSH support in Gerrit back in November 2017 and kept in touch with the community and members until Christmas.  His last commit was made on January 3, 2018, always making commits to the very end of his life. <br><br><pre><code class="hljs sql"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">commit</span></span> ea974d725ed1d5d5ffa1461bef7986168819dee3 <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Merge</span></span>: e650e06 bd42cc7 Author: Shawn Pearce &lt;sop@google.com&gt; <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">Date</span></span>: Wed Jan <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">01</span></span>:<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">06</span></span>:<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">03</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2018</span></span> +<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0000</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Merge</span></span> <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"Prolog cookbook: attribute success to uploader, not author"</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  He never publicly disclosed his illness and how serious it is.  I lived his life in his best ideas and passions until the very end, with his family, his project and all that he loved most. <br><br><h3>  Shawn's Legacy </h3><br>  When great leaders like Sean leave, there is always the danger of leaving a void behind.  I believe that it is impossible to replace Sean, because he was a truly unique leader in his style and passion. <br><br>  However, what he created is an active and healthy community that will continue to adhere to the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat he instilled in us with his professional and personal inspiring life. <br><br>  He defined what Sean created as a ‚Äúhealthy living project‚Äù that can survive his life and our existence.  Below 10 years of the project in numbers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/an/6j/wv/an6jwv7pkv4x7dseipnrdvdae8a.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Thanks </h3><br>  We are all grateful to Sean for what he has done for us and for the future participants and receivers of Git, JGit and Gerrit Code Review. <br><br>  <b>I was lucky that I knew and worked with such an inspiring leader.</b>  <b>Thanks, Sean.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348200/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348200/</a></p>
