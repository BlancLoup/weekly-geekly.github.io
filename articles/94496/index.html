Before transferring to a new hosting, the site hung in the stage - the client will come from a search engine click, leave an order (by the way, in the search engine for key phrases were in 10-17 places).  However, after the move, the customer made a decision to actively promote services through advertising on the Internet, and not only word of mouth and search engines.  The site has undergone minor changes - increased speed, a more ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù tariff was taken, the order structure was revised.  Since the maxhost was down, the information was taken from the backups, and the old version of the site was left out of access, which I deleted on the first access to the raised ftp makhost.  just at this time, a note appeared on the Maxxot official website that you can receive compensation by writing a letter to their billing, which was done. <br>  I am still waiting for an answer from billing. <br><br>  May 21, received a letter from MaxSot: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <code><a href="http://mchost.ru/datacenter/"></a> , <br> <br>   *****     . <br> <br>        . <br> <br>     ()   ,       .     NS   ns1.mchost.ru ns2.mchost.ru . <br> <br>        , ..         -  .   -    mchost.ru/datacenter . <br> <br>     -              support@mchost.ru .     -. <br> <br>  , <br>     <br>  </code> <br> <br>  where it is clearly written - you want to transfer sites back - change the NS server. <br>  since there was already a new hosting, a working advertisement, which, when transferred, needed to be stopped before updating NS on all root servers, and the decision to remain in Russia, we decided to ignore this letter (the letter as seen from the text is informative).

      However, going to the post office today and looking at fresh orders (orders are duplicated there in case of failure of the mail from the customer, and just for the sake of reading what they write) noted that the order lacks several fields that were added a few weeks ago.  After a brief check, it turned out that these fields are not in the order form itself, but all the news is no older than April. <br>  What suggested that something new hoster flooded for some reason a backup, or that my site was attached to Maxxot and decided to return to it without permission. <br>  Having logged in at the registrator, I saw that indeed the NS records themselves changed to the NS-ki maxxot, despite the fact that I am the owner of the domains, and with any change in the settings I receive a letter <br>  view: <br><br> <code> ****! <br> <br>   DNS-   ****.ru  . <br> <br>       DNS <br>    ,     <br>  WHOIS     1-2 . <br> <br> * * * <br> <br> Nameservers update for domain ****.ru has been initiated successfully. <br> <br> All data on root DNS servers will be updated in 24 hours. WHOIS data will <br> be updated in 48 hours.</code> <br> <br>  Which in the mail I did not observe. <br><br>  After that, an angry letter was written to the makhost and the registrar, demanding an explanation of the reasons why this site was changed, without the consent of the owner of the domain (s) <br><br>  Makhost responded promptly: <br><br> <code><a href="http://webna/"></a> . <br> <br>       .                DNS. <br>        webna**.ru (    , ). <br>      . <br> <br> . <br> <br>   <br>   </code> <br> <br>  After that, I explained, the respected support of the maxhsot (and she‚Äôs the best I‚Äôve seen there), <br>  that my domains are already stuck to my domains and I myself edited them when moving. <br><br>  Now I am waiting for a letter from the registrar explaining who and why changed the data on the domains. <br><br>  The customer of the site is considering filing a claim for damages. <br>  Habrovchane, check the NS records for their domains, which were at the highway </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94496/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94496/</a></p>
