For example, here are hardware checkboxes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68c/28c/a40/68c28ca4069447eaa9c2f632a5a9455a.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, the best example of the correct engineering interface is a <b>cut glass</b> .

      Why?  Very simple.  On the one hand, he is friendly to Soviet robots: the round upper band allows automatic washing to grope him since the 40s.  On the other hand, he forgives human errors: the ribs stop rolling the glass off the table when it falls.  Plus it's just beautiful. <br><br>  Now I will show some more interfaces that make life easier.  The general meaning is to try to <b>understand how the developer thought</b> to make something more convenient. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  But I'll start with a bad example.  One of the ugliest IT interfaces I've seen is disk packaging.  After three uses it will be covered in prints, scratched or left without an envelope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d1/19c/1f7/4d119c1f7b764326b74cd37ff830f927.jpeg"><br><br>  Now <b>affordans</b> .  Afforans is an "inviting" or "alluring" property of an object, clearly indicating the nature of its action.  An example from the real world is the orientation of tailor's scissors, where you just can‚Äôt put your fingers in the wrong way (there is a wide hole for 4 fingers on one side and smaller - a thumb on the other).  A pencil for writing a new post on the left Habr panel is also an example of a weak affordans. <br><br>  So, usually IT-interfaces used some objects from the real world to build metaphors.  Well, sort of ajar door on the exit button and so on.  The problem to be solved is the transfer of experience from a familiar area to an unfamiliar one. <br><br>  Here is an example of how well the old experience is transferred to the training.  Here it is important for us to teach the user to open the bag in place (that is, to orient it correctly): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/510/528/26d/51052826d69c4dab98c8f12417c687d1.jpeg"><br><br>  Well, at the same time good advertising, right? <br><br>  There is a reverse process.  Appstore icons are quite well brought into reality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d6/87d/4a1/0d687d4a11ef478dacba3c14c6ac1c86.jpeg"><br><br>  I never thought that I would see how icons are sold, but no, that's it. <br><br>  It is worth mentioning a <b>bag of sugar</b> .  There is a legend about him that the inventor committed suicide because no one understood how to use it.  So, it is assumed that you do not tear off his head or tail, but gently break in the middle.  Which, by the way, is much faster, more convenient and can even be done with one hand.  Unfortunately, these bags are not always properly stuffed - and instead of a hard tube, you get such a sluggish snot.  This is an example of how, in general, a good interface can be defeated by previous user experience. <br><br>  Another great example of prejudice is containers for hot food and salads.  Plastic such transparent.  Again, the engineers invented making ears so that you can easily grab them and lift the lid without popping it with your fingernails.  The first implementation was not the best - one eye on the container and one on the lid.  It was assumed that when closing the ears do not match.  Obviously, everyone closed them one to one.  Because it looks so neat.  Here is the next level of evolution of these ears: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/549/9db/0a8/5499db0a8d1342cfaab7e5d868f65b58.jpeg"><br><br>  Now <b>fucking package</b> that does not want to open.  Just in a pack, it is compressed so that it becomes difficult to separate the layers.  The engineer came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãprinting ‚Äúoblique‚Äù packages when one layer is shorter than the other: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d72/8b0/e49/d728b0e494ec4c5ca831c0a16f0d11f5.jpeg"><br><br>  This is a great solution.  But when we started ordering our packages for retail five years ago, it turned out that another excellent person with an IT education (chemist) had also come up with a polymer that takes and does not stick.  Just do not stick together and everything.  Now, when chemists tell me about the features of the perceptron architecture for rendering polymers, I no longer ask questions.  I felt the packages. <br><br>  In general, packages are the clearest example of the struggle of a manufacturer's interface, a customer's interface, and human greed.  See these ones? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc6/acb/c7f/dc6acbc7feb948f381ab357e4b247503.jpeg"><br><br>  I am sure that the shops that use them, every day loses hell a lot of money just because there are situations: ‚ÄúOh, apples.  I'll take a couple ... and, no, the package must be unsealed. "  It was possible to buy packages that are easily uncoupled.  It was possible to use others.  But no, keep the interface awkward. <br><br>  Go ahead.  <b>The cans</b> illustrate embedding a tool for working with an object in the object itself.  Without such a key, you need to look for a can opener (and some of them are very nontrivial for learning), or try to open the can with improvised means.  We opened them with knives, bricks, axes, and even a spoon once.  It was necessary to build the tool into the bank itself - and everything became much more convenient: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/148/f0b/52b/148f0b52b31740c489871209ed2f983a.jpeg"><br><br>  But the spoon goes along with the yogurt.  I was incredibly happy when I found her.  The manufacturer, I think, too, because now you can eat yogurt in the park.  And do not carry a tool for this.  Sales certainly rose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8b/46f/9ca/f8b46f9ca18042d4909a0098faaf443d.jpeg"><br><br>  And this is one of the most interesting specimens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12f/36b/996/12f36b99686949579a97aab85a1d316e.jpeg"><br><br>  In the twenty-first century, the cost of production of such a "nipple" is not much higher than the usual tube.  You just had to think and do a second time.  Until you try this milk, the difference is incomprehensible - but after that the usual tube directly noticeably scratches the tongue.  It would be difficult to come up with such a question by asking users "what can you improve?". <br><br>  The following case is an example of solving the same problem by different methods.  Bread is sometimes good to buy sliced.  We sell pre-sliced ‚Äã‚Äãbread, which costs more than a ruble or two.  In Europe and Africa almost everywhere there are such bread slicers.  You can shove anything there.  Something tells me that this solution is better: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0bd/946/3a9/0bd9463a96fd47369a51736ba4fb86f2.jpg"><br><br>  And one more example.  This "toilet" also met in a Norwegian store: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/020/745/b2a/020745b2af234c608aaad74061f4ef26.jpeg"><br><br>  If you pay a bill, the cashier presses a button on the cashier with her image.  In the lower tray "toilet" falling surrender coins.  If you pay with coins, you just drop them on top.  The device carefully sorts and recounts them.  Insanely saves time at the box office and just happy. <br><br>  Milk tubes and these devices have a common feature - they, at first glance, are completely unnecessary to the ordinary person, but if they are used, a feeling of delight appears.  And yes, in our history, too, there was one such strange subject.  A man came to us and brought rugs with sleeves.  "Weird" - we thought in chorus.  But no, they did not stick there, but really found a need.  When I sat with a tablet that night and was cold (it was such a beautiful rainy day in Moscow when it was very cold), it was really cold in my hands.  Previously, I would have just wrapped the blanket in a smarter blanket, but this bad person made me want to buy. <br><br>  He left a few pieces - and we tested them on living people on game stores. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c46/246/dd8/c46246dd848a426e9a82132ce27e15e0.jpeg"><br><br>  It was incredibly difficult to take rugs away from living people just after taking photos.  As a result, we put them on sale.  At this point, the manufacturer brought a blanket with 4 sleeves - for two.  And this thing, it seems to me, will shoot - couples will no longer have to share a tucked blanket.  At least when I thought about a wedding gift, it worked. <br><br>  But we go further.  Here is another example of the <b>need</b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f72/74d/333/f7274d333c9b41baa3ac0fafe0d52182.jpeg"><br><br>  This is a cellular modem that distributes around Wi-Fi.  You need to constantly share it with hotel guests or bus passengers, so a password is written on it.  If you saw Yota Many, then you know that there this problem is solved by the switch "on - off - network without password".  True, flimsy, but the idea is excellent. <br><br>  And finally, a wonderful (probably the most successfully working to increase the speed of object recognition) and at the same time a low-tech example of indication from Samarkand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/605/e87/0e2/605e870e227949c78ff6633c99ea8ceb.jpeg"><br><br>  Yes, in order to distinguish spices in the spice bazaar, source code samples are stuck in them. <br><br>  But the combination of IT and a thoughtful approach.  <b>Queue implementation</b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de8/fe0/59c/de8fe059ce8f456ba412b4b789072971.jpg"><br><br>  One common queue, which is divided into 20 cash desks.  At the exit to the cashier zone - the number to which to go.  There is no problem of a slower queue from the side, it is easy to unzip cashiers without stress for those who waited (just do not send to this queue), there is always an average waiting time, even if a passenger with a huge basket is in front, there are no problems with a sudden problem in your tail.  And one cool check-raising checkout area, where you can coolly and insanely tasty to lay out everything that is usually put on small patches near individual cash desks.  Unambiguous profit for the store and for the people in it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/232505/">https://habr.com/ru/post/232505/</a></p>
