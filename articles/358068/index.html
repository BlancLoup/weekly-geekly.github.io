Mark Weiser, then the principal investigator of Xerox PARC, was largely right.  Technologies have become commonplace and are increasingly dissolving in our lives and our space, affecting companies, society and individuals.

Speaking of trust, our focus today is in three directions: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Privacy</b>  This is the basic right of people.  Microsoft is actively working to meet the requirements of the GDPR and the protection of the rights of its clients in the High Court (USA). </li><li>  <b>Cybersecurity</b>  We must share responsibility for the security of the world with other companies.  Examples of this are the new cross-industrial initiatives of the Cybersecurity Tech Accord and Digital Geneva Convention Convention. </li><li>  <b>Ethics in AI</b> .  While improving our AI algorithms, it is critical that we take the necessary steps to ensure the ethics of the algorithms.  ‚ÄúWe must not only ask ourselves what computers can do, but what should they do?‚Äù </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/458/103/af4/458103af4bcf86cfdc1d5d13dcb97833.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Speaking about the Microsoft technology agenda, Satya Nadella concentrated on three areas: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Ubiquitous calculations.</b>  Cloud computing is becoming more global, Azure services are available from 50 regions, last year we launched the Azure Stack, which allows you to build a hybrid history.  We also began to actively work on the transfer of computational and intellectual stuffing to end devices through the Azure IoT Edge and the recently announced Azure Sphere solutions for creating secure microcontrollers.  At the conference, we announced that the Azure IoT Runtime will be laid out in open source, together with a number of partners, we announced developer kits for creating smart devices - from embedded devices to drones. </li><li>  <b>Artificial Intelligence.</b>  Huge progress in the industry.  In 2016, we observed equality with people in object recognition tests, in 2017 we talked about speech recognition, and in 2018 equality in machine reading and translation.  But it's not about achievements, but about translating them into frameworks and tools that developers can use.  In addition to speech and image development kits for developers, including Project Kinect for Azure, we are also updating our cognitive services in the cloud and gradually making available to developers a new generation of hardware acceleration solutions for AI computing within Project Brainwave. </li><li>  <b>The multiplicity of devices and sensors</b> .  We are talking about the transition from the picture of the worlds (the developer), in which the devices were in the center, to the picture with the man in the foreground.  Microsoft 365, combining Windows and Office, aims to create an experience in which many people in many locations can interact through many sensory systems of many different devices.  An example of such an experience is Cortana, which is available on a variety of platforms and surfaces, and during the conference we announced a partnership with Amazon for mutual integration of Cortana and Alexa.  At the heart of such solutions is the extensible Microsoft Graph, which allows to combine world data, data of organizations and individuals.  Of course, taking into account the requirements of privacy imposed by companies and personal by each of us. </li></ul><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bbrZ2pvubL0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Finally, Satya announced a new <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai-for-accessibility">AI for Accessibility</a> program that provides grants and support to research organizations, NGOs, and entrepreneurs to help people with disabilities to fully participate in society and the economy. <br><br><h2>  Perception-Powered Intelligent Edge Dev Kits [1-3] </h2><br>  During the conference, Microsoft announced a series of kits for developers aimed at the tasks of ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù the world around - from scanning space to analyzing speech. <br><br><ul><li>  Project Kinect for Azure </li><li>  Vision AI Developer Kit </li><li>  Speech Devices development kit </li></ul><br>  In addition to these three devices, the conference also showed the development kit <a href="">Groove Starter Kit for Azure IoT Edge</a> from the company Seeed and a <a href="">smart IoT-button</a> from the company TeXXmo. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/perception">General description</a> .</b> <br><br><h3>  Project Kinect for Azure </h3><br>  <b>Project Kinect for Azure</b> - a new set of sensors, based on developments in Kinect and Hololens, which will also be a major part of the next generation of Hololens!  The device includes a new generation depth camera (Time-of-Flight (ToF)), 4K RGB camera and a set of 360 ¬∞ microphones and is aimed at scenarios that require spatial vision, recognition of people and objects, hand movements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c34/6df/a1f/c346dfa1ffb160d1a505b93e287b3445.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Project Kinect for Azure combines the capabilities of the device itself and the AI ‚Äã‚Äãservices in Microsoft Azure.  According to the link below, Alex Kipman writes that using data from a depth camera can significantly reduce the size of grids for in-depth training compared to conventional cameras.  Along with this, increasing the overall energy efficiency of the device. <br><br>  <b>References:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/introducing-project-kinect-azure-alex-kipman">Review from Alex Kipman</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/campaigns/kinect">Subscribe to announcements</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://microsoft.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e9dCT1s9C5CwUkJ">Sign up for an early access program</a> . </li></ul><br><h3>  Vision AI Developer Kit </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/314/d23/c1f/314d23c1f37af9e3d1d7268e825e6a48.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As part of a strategic partnership between Microsoft and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., we are working to create the AI ‚Äã‚ÄãDeveloper Kit based on the Qualcomm chipset and the Azure IoT Edge.

What if some smart agent keeps track of what code you are writing now and know how you wrote before (maybe even in the next folder), understands the context of the project and even knows the best practices (based on the most popular repositories Github)  And such an agent will help you write the best code. <br><br>  How exactly, you ask?  Well, for example, it will give hints of completion of a code not only an alphabetical list of properties of an object / class, but also put the most popular or contextually relevant options at the beginning?  Or will he understand the style of the code in the project and suggest when you get out of style recommendations and even automatically apply them?  Or, say, when analyzing the next pull request, it will be able to automatically analyze the code and suggest what to look for? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/277/7d7/d79/2777d7d79a82449f964a849afab6a8f8.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  The new Visual Studio extension VS IntelliCode is aimed precisely at such tasks. <br><br>  <b>Links</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items%3FitemName%3DVisualStudioExptTeam.VSIntelliCode">To try</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2018/05/07/introducing-visual-studio-intellicode">Review</a> . </li></ul><br><h3>  Mobile CI </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e2e/612/227/e2e61222785d4631542e5d8feb869e23.gif" alt="image"><br>  Continuous Integration (CI) for mobile developers using GitHub has become easier thanks to the Visual Studio App Center application in the store of the latter. <br><br>  Continuing to develop engagement with the open source community of developers, Microsoft announced a new partnership with GitHub, adding the power of Azure DevOps services to GitHub users. <br><br>  Now, developers of applications for iOS, Android, Xamarin and Reac Native with repositories on GitHub can connect their App Center account to it to set up automatic building of projects from source, test validation (including UI testing).  After this, App Center updates the Pull Request status on GitHub so that you can accept changes to your project.  Using App Center, you can also set up application publishing to application stores, thereby automating the entire chain from code changes to application delivery to end users. <br><br>  <b>References:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vsappcenter/microsoft-and-github-present-an-integrated-continuous-integration-and-delivery-solution-for-mobile">Review</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/app-center">VS App Center application</a> . </li></ul><br>  In the <a href="https://habr.com/company/microsoft/blog/359044/">next issue,</a> we will tell you about Azure and bots! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358068/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358068/</a></p>
