      The last couple of years it has been fashionable to do geo-social dating.  I don‚Äôt remember who started it, but ‚ÄúFirs‚Äù from Arkady Moreynis appeared on the Runet.  Now the term ‚Äúgeo-dating‚Äù is practically a curse in the ranks of young Internet entrepreneurs. <br><br>  My story begins on a fine summer day when I opened the RSS feed from TechCrunch, it seems, and I came across an article about the Tinder service.  I must say that by nature I am extremely shy.  I think I will be even more shy than Raj from TBBT.  Come to the girl and talk!  Yourself?  Out of the blue?  No, thank you! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  So, the article described how to become popular on this service, Tinder.  About which I was not yet known.  I read, tried, and I liked it.) Especially hooked simplicity. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Briefly about how Tinder works:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>You are shown people sorted by geographic proximity to your position.</i>  <i>Your will like or miss (Mark also started with this, we remember hot or not).</i>  <i>If the likes on both sides match, you will open a private chat.</i> </div></div><br><br>  I decided to try to do something like this in Russia, because  there were no analogues, and I just wanted to try.  Our company was just closed, and 40 people dismissed us, issuing even some compensation.  As you understood, I decided to try copying Tinder in Russia.  Aboard! <br><br>  On the past project, I met a talented Python \ Django programmer, and by that time I myself translated all my projects into Python.  Wonderful language.  Zhenya listened to me and replied that he was interested in the idea and the stack of technologies that we will use.  He is in the game.  From this moment on, we will speak on behalf of "we." <br><br><h3>  Process </h3><br>  Tinder is a mobile application, we decided to create the web from the very beginning.  True, with the condition that all interfaces will be implemented in an adaptive version.  For many reasons, probably the most important - the lack of competence in mobile programming, and even with the web, the process of making changes at the moment is still more flexible. <br><br>  A prototype was worked out, although we looked at the above named service, we still fantasized and created ‚Äúour‚Äù product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46a/377/44c/46a37744c01198983ddb66fd75812c19.png"><br><br>  When all the pages were created, and the basic scenarios were passed 100 times, it‚Äôs time to do the graphics.  I must say that I have quite a lot of experience in Internet projects, and there are enough proven specialists.  And yet I decided to turn "sideways", take a chance, brush up on acquaintances, look at other points of view.  Posted ad on frelansim and fl.  I write announcements in a special way, the main thing is to convey the importance of my product and the degree of importance of the work and the person you are looking for, I will probably write a topic someday.  Again, having experience behind me, I was very critical of the work in the portfolio of responding designers. <br><br>  As a result, a wonderful designer was found who agreed for $ 7,500.  (do not forget, I did not work, and we did this project with personal money), make us all the screens + their adaptive versions.  It seems that he was somewhere in Thailand at that time, and rather regarded this work as a rest (in fact, correctly), he was given a complete blank check and ‚Äúrubber‚Äù terms.  After two weeks of quite hard work (meetings every evening) the design stage was completed.  We were pleased, and we really liked it (Hi, Artem, thank you for what you did for us.). <br><br>  This was the main page: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/257/688/c3e/257688c3e4b101477e51036c5a9df1b2.png"><br><br>  and her mobile sister. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b90/2b3/087/b902b308709cf95ed427b6d7d46536e1.png"><br><br>  By this time, about a month has passed since the start of development.  Probably worth mentioning the layout.  We also searched for the layout designer remotely, and found a cool Ukrainian guy.  Which not only agreed to help us for 7 000 rub., But also, being carried away by the idea, he brought a lot of useful information from himself.  Remember - a good specialist at every stage can add something that you haven‚Äôt even thought about and did not know. <br><br>  We are approaching the main stage of our project - revitalization.  Programming.  Zhenya, when he learned that I was fired, in every possible way supported me morally and refused money, agreeing to a share.  Well, I hope someday I can thank him.  The development process took another 1.5 months, since we had to work in the evenings in between work.  Yes, and we did not burn, it was important to have fun and learn new things.  By the time I began to actively look for work.  Along the way, Zhenya and I have another common content project to which I devoted a couple of evenings a week.  About the development and technologies used will be a separate article. <br><br>  The first alpha versions showed that the model is viable, and many were warmly received.  But closer to the release of the project, we realized that we want something completely different.  Not deytinga, more precisely deytinga, as one of the components of the project, but pursuing a different goal. <br><br><h4>  What we wanted and what we came to </h4><br><br>  Tinder is based on the fact that people are selected depending on your current situation.  We introduced the term "Places" - important points for you on the map.  For example, I definitely have ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúWork‚Äù + a couple of places where I like to walk.  This is where our differences with Tinder and hope for the future begin. <br><br>  While we were doing our service, I was more and more thinking about the importance of the city for people.  What does "City for People" mean?  And not only cities, but spaces as a whole.  I managed to take part in a study called ‚ÄúOne Day in Life‚Äù.  Further, the KO quote is ‚ÄúThe most negative peak of the day is the way out of the house, and the most positive, respectively, return‚Äù.  And what actually makes the house home?  And the city is not home?  With our project we want to push the limits, make the places in the city animated, familiar and "our". <br><br>  For the time being, we do not intend to remove the dating functionality, since  it's pretty funny.) View photos, hike, chat, schedule a date.  But it is your choice.  Until the end of the year, we will fix the found bugs and add the functionality of events around your place (cinema, theater, concerts, lectures) and offline service for meetings of urban initiative groups. <br><br>  <b>If you are interested, <a href="http://onedaylunch.com/">join</a> (sorry, registration is required for now).</b> <br><br><h4>  A little advice </h4><br><br>  I know that in principle, it is useless to speak.  And it is necessary to understand, I'm sorry, the fifth point.  But do not start your projects with a solution; start with studying a problem.  The question is which problem is best solved. <br><br>  I hope you were interested in our experience, and the project.) For all the questions, I will be happy to answer in the comments. <br><br>  <i>PS Now we are looking for a mobile developer who could take on the iOs version.</i>  <i>On the conditions of cooperation - it is better in lichku, it will be either some small amount, or the percentage is not yet clear what.).</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201120/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201120/</a></p>
