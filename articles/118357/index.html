The articles are devoted to three main topics - restrictions on connection speed, screen resolutions and user behavior. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://usabilitytestinghowto.blogspot.com/2011/02/involving-older-adults-in-design-of.html">Usability Testing - Involving older adults</a></strong> <br>  Dana Chisnell recommendations on conducting user research and testing with older users.  The author offers several forms to record the results of surveys. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/uxzeitgeist/">Rosenfeld Zeitgeist - Books, Articles, and Topics</a></strong> <br>  The specialized publisher Rosenfeld Media has launched a mini-library that recommends interesting books and articles on the subject of design.  It works like a wiki - readers can add content. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/mobile-form-design-strategies/">Mobile Form Design Strategies</a></strong> <br>  Excellent article Chui Chui Tan on the design of forms for mobile sites.  She gives advice on how to simplify the form from the main site and make it more comfortable in the face of limited mobile phone capabilities. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36299.html">Scale - User-Centered Metrics for Web Applications</a></strong> <br>  Employees of Google have published a scientific publication in which they describe the HEART framework, which allows user experience to be assessed using several metrics.  It is actively used in the work of the company and may be useful to other organizations. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxmag.com/design/transience">Transience</a></strong> <br>  Joshua Allen writes about the ephemeral nature of user interfaces.  Often they are thought and designed as something reliable and predictable, although in cases of entertainment products, surprise is important. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/creating-design-principles">Creating Great Design Principles - 6 Counter-intuitive Tests</a></strong> <br>  Jared Spool lists design principles in large companies and matches beautiful but less useful common words with really working messages.  He shows by example how these principles help in the work on the product. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.zuschlogin.com/%3Fp%3D183">Major Web Standards for General Usability</a></strong> <br>  Michael Zuschlag proposes to use the US military standard MIL-STD 1472 to evaluate user interfaces on the Internet.  It is called Design Criteria Standard: Human Engineering and has many intersections with web-specific. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.funkydesignspaces.com/">Funky Design Spaces by Andr√©s Lucero</a></strong> <br>  The Andres Lucero project, which explores the use of mood boards in the early stages of design work.  He wants to understand how this experience can be applied in the design of interfaces. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/03/approaches-to-user-research-when-designing-for-children.php">Approaches to User Research When Designing for Children</a></strong> <br>  Catalina Naranjo-Bock describes her user research experience with children and shares tips on how to build the process and how to work. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/split-testing-blog/landing-page-best-practices/">Landing Page Best Practices - the definitive guide (with infographics)</a></strong> <br>  An employee of the company Visual Website Optimizer Oli Gardner has published a good reference poster that describes the best practice layout pages.

John Innes gives advice to experts on how to prove the importance of classical methods in this situation. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/sketching-the-visual-thinking-power-tool/">Sketching - The Visual Thinking Power Tool</a></strong> <br>  Mike Rohde describes for A List Apart the process of creating sketches and tools for working with them. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxforthemasses.com/usability-reviews/">A guide to carrying out usability reviews</a></strong> <br>  A simple but very useful template for the preparation of peer review usability.

Templates are available as an <a href="http://www.uxforthemasses.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Usability-review-template.xls">MS Excel spreadsheet</a> and <a href="http://www.uxforthemasses.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Usability-review-template.pdf">PDF file</a> . <br><br><h3>  Instruments </h3><br>  <strong><a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2011/03/28/observed-ux-techniques-a-handy-pocket-reminder/">UX Techniques, a Handy Pocket Reminder</a></strong> <br>  An iPhone application that put together a compact and visual description of 45 key design methods and practices.
