The manners of courteous communication in Russian and English are different;  about some of the nuances of practical interaction with English-speaking clients - in the translation of an article by an entrepreneur and international sales expert Grant Cardon.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you want to earn more, watch out for manners.  Don't call me “buddy,” “dude,” or “buddy,” simply because I added you as a friend on Facebook or because you subscribed to me on Twitter or Instagram. <br>  I am probably one of the most “informal” businessmen you will ever have to meet, but this does not mean that you can forget about manners: everyone should have good manners. <br>  Good manners are an art, a sign of professionalism, and they will help you on the path to success in the real world. <br>  These 12 rules of good tone should become your habit if you are looking for professional prosperity. <br><br><h4>  1. Contact by last name. </h4><br>  Regardless of how well you are familiar, contact your partner, starting with “Mr.” ( <i>Mr.</i> ), “Mrs.” ( <i>Mrs.</i> ) or “Miss” ( <i>Ms.</i> ) - a sign of respect.  By this you show that you are here - precisely in order to serve the client.  And it does not matter how many times the client told you: “Call me by name”;  It’s not at all difficult to continue to address by last name, with the polite "Mr.", "Mrs." or "Miss" in front of her. <br><br><h4>  2. Use the phrases: “Yes, sir” and “No, sir”, “Yes, ma'am” and “No, ma'am”. </h4><br>  In modern culture, we completely ignore all the formalities.  If a person buys a product or service from you, he is still a step above you, regardless of age. <br>  As a buyer, your client is the boss, and you are the slave.  You are NOT on an equal footing, and the use of the phrases “yes, sir” and “no, sir” shows that you understand this. <br><br><h4>  3. "With pleasure." </h4><br>  Instead of the usual: “Let's do it”, answer with enthusiasm: “With pleasure” ( <i>“My pleasure”</i> ).  So you will demonstrate your willingness to help. <br><br><h4>  4. “Thank you for your time” (“ <i>Thank you for your time</i> ”). </h4><br>  Time is valuable.  Thanks to the client for his or her time at the beginning of the conversation and then again at the end is a sign that you value his or her time. <br>  Never say: "I do not want to waste your and your time."  Your time does not matter: client time is what matters. <br><br><h4>  5. Do not interrupt. </h4><br>  Many of us make this mistake: listen to answer, not to understand.  That understanding should be the main task.  By interrupting, you show disrespect, and this will never help to improve business relationships. <br><br><h4>  6. Confirm. </h4><br>  Before answering the customer, confirm that you have heard and understood him.  Say, for example: <i>“Thank you for noticing</i> this, I agree with you” ( <i>“I agree with you”</i> ).  If you do not acknowledge receipt of information, the client may have a feeling that he was not heard and did not show due respect to him. <br><br><h4>  7. All attention to the interlocutor. </h4><br>  During a conversation with a client, do you chat, answer calls, do other things, and think you look like “mega-business”?  No, you look mega-rude and because of this you can lose mega-a lot of money.  Always give your full attention to the person in front of you. <br><br><h4>  8. "Thank you, thank you, thank you." </h4><br>  Gratitude to the client is never too much.  Thank him in any way possible.  Write sms ten seconds after your meeting.  Then call or write an email with thanks. <br>  And if after that you still send a hand-written postcard, this will be the most memorable way to express gratitude.  “I would like to thank you once again for your cooperation and to say that we really appreciate you as a customer” ( <i>“I appreciate you as a customer”</i> ) is a very good written gratitude. <br><br><h4>  9. "Sorry." </h4><br>  This is just common sense.  If you have interfered with someone or invaded his personal space, admit it and apologize. <br>  This is a sign of respect.  Also, if you enter the office where people are already talking, this is a polite way to be noticed and get an answer to your question as soon as possible. <br><br><h4>  10. Hold the door. </h4><br>  Never enter first.  Hold the door to everyone who comes in with you: no matter who he is.  Holding the door to a stranger, you will demonstrate your politeness and good manners. <br><br><h4>  11. "I will definitely clarify this." </h4><br>  Saying “I don't know” is unprofessional.  Moreover, it is impolite, even if it is true.  “I don't know,” sometimes it may sound like you don't care. <br>  Better answer: “A good question, I will definitely clarify this and let you know” ( <i>“Great question,</i>  So you will demonstrate your desire to be useful to the client and answer all his questions. <br><br><h4>  12. “We are honored to work with you” ( <i>“It's an honor to work with you”</i> ). </h4><br>  Be sure to find your way to express to the client how valuable cooperation with him is for you.  If you cannot express it with due sincerity, ask someone else to work with this client. <br><br>  Good manners are not just boring morals of parents and not outdated rules of behavior.  In the world of business and economics, good manners are rewarded, and bad ones are punished.  Look at those who earn big money, and you will see that they all differ in good manners of business communication. <br><br><br>  <b>About the translator</b> <br><br>  The article is translated in Alconost. <br><br>  Alconost is engaged in the <a href="https://alconost.com/services/software-localization%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3D12_English_communication_rules">localization of applications, games and websites</a> in 60 languages.
