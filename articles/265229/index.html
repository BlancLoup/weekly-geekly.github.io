HP Training Programs‚Äù</i> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Dear colleagues!  My name is Svetlana Stepanova, I am an HP employee, and my presentation will be (I will not try to tell an ITIL course, ITIL Foundation or other courses in an hour, I want to talk about HP services related to organizing ITIL management. I work at HP, My current position is service solution architect. This is actually designing high-level service packages for our customers, those who have a high level of support from HP. And also, as a person who has worked all his life in IT and is certified by an ITIL expert, I will also list a few certificate  We cooperate with our department, which provides training services, and accordingly my part is to provide or read ITIL courses. So I want to say a little bit, repeating, two words about what the previous speakers said, why I personally consider training is so important, so interesting, that it is ready to cooperate, invest its time and than I think it is useful for any organization.  Secondly, it‚Äôs natural to talk about our courses, and, thirdly, probably, like any service designer, you have to ask yourself: why this service than we are better than others in providing this service?  And this is probably the third part of my presentation.  I will be glad to answer your questions on the course materials, on the options for providing these courses, and on the questions that you have. <br><br>  Probably, starting from training, I want to mention a trend that is fashionable today or the terminology that everyone has heard about the ‚Äúnew style of IT‚Äù.  Four main trends that form a new approach to business organization and, accordingly, new IT requirements.  Who can help me call them?  Four main trends that form the "new style of IT". <br><br>  <i>"Mobility"</i> <br><br>  Mobility - ok, thanks a lot.  What can it be expressed as an example? <br><br>  <i>"I carry everything with me."</i> <br><br>  Absolutely right.  Most business transactions start on mobile devices.  One is.  The remaining three? <br><br>  <i>"Clouds, or is it no longer fashionable?"</i> <br><br>  It is fashionable.  Clouds alike.  Who said the clouds, he was absolutely right.  Two, two remaining trends. <br><br>  <i>"Continual improvement"</i> <br><br>  No, not at all.  So, the two remaining.  We all being with our devices are tied to information sources of some kind, we reserve an information footprint that allows us to generate a huge amount of data, which, according to analytics, are now analyzed only for one percent.  Accordingly, the third trend is the big date.  And all the same social networks.  That is, we are constantly looking for advice, we rely on the opinions of other people when making our decisions.  And this opportunity to gain collective knowledge is now much easier, closer, more accessible than before.  So, these four main trends form the ‚Äúnew style of IT‚Äù, and accordingly the ‚Äúnew style of IT‚Äù requires new approaches, forms a new business requirement for IT. <br><br>  But the main claim of the business to IT is too slow, too long.  We want "today for today."  Otherwise we lose our competitive advantage.  Two words, in which I see the advantage of learning from the point of view, well, HP, of course, from the point of view of the organization and naturally from the point of view of the person who invests his strength and his time in training.  From the point of view of the organization: trained employees quickly convert capital investments, which are made in hardware, into the result that a business gets from introducing new solutions.  My colleagues from Astellit will not allow to lie, that the arrival of a new box and getting results from the work of this box are two completely different stages in time. <br><br>  <b>Reliable investment</b> <br><br>  The better employees are trained, the more literate they are, the faster you actually begin to receive a return on the investment in hardware.  You increase your internal knowledge, your organization becomes (both IT and core business) more competitive in the market.  Naturally, trained people more competently manage the infrastructure and, accordingly, the infrastructure works more reliably, breaks less, less illiterate actions of IT department employees can lead to breakdowns that affect the work of the business as a whole.  As for personalities, as for a person who studies, naturally a more literate, more certified employee stands higher in the labor market.  This is your confidence, this is your satisfaction from what you are doing.  You are probably laughing, in the sense that it is easier to lure away a more expensive employee.  We will not go into this discussion, this is probably a double-edged stick, but nevertheless, I believe that it is more profitable for an organization to have more qualified employees.  And, of course, your overall satisfaction with what you are doing, that you understand the results of your work and do your job qualitatively.  A professional always does his job well. <br><br>  So, the benefits of learning.  Well, from learning in general, I want to move on to training in IT management. <br><br>  Why?  Many of my previous colleagues, I think, talked about technological solutions.  How to make, how to set up the equipment correctly, how to make it work, what technological innovations are offered, including HP in the market, and what training services are offered for these products by HP in the market.  My interest lies more in the field of organization of IT work, and such a link is designed to show what the IT enterprise really needs.  An IT enterprise helps an enterprise to operate more efficiently and compete more successfully in the market. <br><br>  Accordingly, typical tasks that the core business solves are projected into certain requirements for reliability, security, time for which the IT service should be restored (these are recovery points).  What does the fulfillment of the requirements for the IT service depend on?  Yes, one of the most famous and prominent components are technological solutions that we put into the work of one or another IT service or IT service.  Nevertheless, reliable operation of an IT service is impossible without two components - these are management processes.  The most powerful tool will not solve the problem if you do not know how to manage it.  And of course, the standard, more focus area, the organization of interaction with partners. <br><br>  But now we are talking about exactly how to organize the work of IT.  And in order to provide a reliable IT service, you must work out and harmonize, design the joint work of three elements: selected hardware solutions (technological solutions), an appropriate level of maturity of the reliability quality of the process of managing them, and, naturally, the necessary support from suppliers or subcontractors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/276/346/ca4/276346ca4ed747e1a2fe627d17d0d65e.png"><br><br>  The three main tasks (wanted to ask), which are now the most popular, which are facing IT management. <br>  Security that Dmitry mentioned.  More and more of our customers are thinking about, first, how to organize the safe management of their data, and now there is a rather large interest in formal certification of compliance with these information security standards, not to mention those business segments in which the passage of compliance certain standards, for example, PCIDSS is a business requirement. <br><br>  Unfortunately, our unstable situation with a new force showed, firstly, it revived something, interest or refreshed interest and showed those flaws that are now in management in terms of business continuity, backup sites, again not only technological, but and the organization of the work of people when switching work on the backup site.  And I would be very surprised if your IT organization is not faced with the task of reducing costs, that is, the need to perform more work for a smaller amount of invested funds, costs in the operating area are a particularly strong focus.  These are the tasks that are facing IT management.  Why they are needed, well, actually, probably two words about ITIL. <br><br>  <b>IT service management for quality improvement</b> <br><br>  So, what are the approaches to managing IT?  Actually they need to be summed up in the form of such a pyramid.  At the top of the pyramid are standards that describe to us what we should do, in particular, the standard for managing IT services by ISO / IEC 20000. In order to give there some workpieces, best approaches, best practices, here are some frameworks?  and ITIL (I'll decode it) is one of them.  Best practices, again tips, need to be applied or specified according to the type of activity your business conducts.  What do you do?  and so here are these common practices to project onto your experience on your business?  As a result, you are given a ready-made set of processes, metrics, and IT management rules. <br><br>  What is ITIL?  ITIL stands for IT Infrastructure Library.  In general, like any library, this is a collection of books that describes best practices for organizing IT work.  The history of these practices is as if it originated in the late 80s in the UK, this is a project of the UK government, which was faced with the need to receive a uniform quality of IT services for government organizations.  I will not go into the story again.  In order to achieve such a unified approach and uniform quality of IT-services, the British government initiated a project to collect and systematize the best practices that have shown themselves in various areas of activity, and create such a library that describes these common practices.  Since then, which have passed since the late 80s, this library has evolved, changing the number of books.  That is, now we are working with the 2011 version, it changed its focus from technological to managerial, expanded its focus from a simple process approach, that is, performing certain actions better and better, to the focus of connections between IT and business. <br><br>  It is not enough to carry out any sequence of actions better and more optimally, this sequence should be necessary to someone.  That is what you do in IT should be constantly in demand by someone who consumes IT services, for whom IT services work in a corporation.  This is the story, in fact, the best practices, as we call it, on IT management, which is formulated in the library of books ITIL and our own courses, which are devoted to the study of these best practices.  Here are a lot of these courses.  Nevertheless, let us briefly go through what training options we offer. <br><br>  Focusing on virtually all IT staff, we offer a set of basic knowledge about how IT works, and what approaches exist.  At present, the organization of IT management on the basis of best practices, which is set out in ITIL, is (well, wrong to say this: conventionally a de facto standard), but in fact this is the most common approach that is widely used.  Therefore, regardless of whether the employee knows about the existence of ITIL or not, he is likely to be somehow involved in the work of those IT management processes that work in his organization.  Therefore, understanding why the organization of work is done exactly this way will be quite useful at the level of any employee from the IT department.  These are ITIL Foundation courses, which we have in two versions, I will return to this issue later.  Further for those who want to get to know the practitioners more deeply.  And here I would also mention the existence of a business need for such knowledge.  That is, a person who focuses on the implementation of processes, who plans or wants to be a leader or team leader, as a group leader who is responsible for the development of the IT management process in an organization, can be recommended for them to advance to a higher degree of certification, which is called ITIL-expert. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/697/e48/213/697e48213c4444759a3f9be48510aa71.jpg"><br><br>  Accordingly, we offer you two tracks that allow you to get the relevant knowledge, relevant certificates and reach or get an ITIL-expert qualification.  Here we need to note that our trainings and the exams that you pass are official certificates.  That is, trainings are officially certified, and you receive certificates not from HP, and not from the training center MUK.  You get certificates recognized in the market that confirm your knowledge of the relevant knowledge, that is, it is practically, if so put in one row, the same certificates that you receive from Microsoft, Cisco independent certification.  In this case, you will receive official certification confirming your knowledge of the basics or expert knowledge in the organization of IT work according to the ITIL methodology.  If someone is interested in details, I can tell you more details. <br><br>  So, once again returning to the courses, we begin with basic training, which is available in two versions, takes three days, ends with a basic exam.  Further, if you want to continue your studies, you can follow one of the lines related to the consistent study of each of the more detailed books that are included in the ITIL library, or here is a more practical approach, which is based on four main departments: service management in terms of strategic planning, daily work, commissioning and design-related services.  A little intersect here, or rather not a little, but the courses in this or that direction intersect quite strongly.  The choice is the preference and, probably, the readiness of the group.  Since, in order to go further in studying ITIL, as a rule, people gather, here is some kind of group, and it consistently moves in one of the directions, and accordingly, the readiness and availability of these courses in the market, it is also determined by such elements Like, on what track did another group of people go, who want to be certified, to achieve this certification.  It is quite expensive in terms of money, therefore, for the organization, there must be appropriate business justification in order for people to start this way and complete it. <br><br>  In more detail, perhaps, about the courses that we read in the field of ITIL Foundation.  I love these courses very much.  The interest for me, as a person who actively works with knowledge, with all kinds of models, is that here in that basic course, we are creating for three days (two and a half even) in a compressed form a structure that allows us to understand what described in books on IT management.  What are the main approaches, what are the main processes, how are they related.  That is, to create some kind of foundation or grid, which you can then decorate, add new knowledge to it as you move.  But, probably, the ability to create quickly and effectively these basic knowledge, this is our know-how, and this is what attracts me in the course of ITIL-Foundation.  As I said, it is available in two versions. <br><br>  One of the classic options.  We work consistently with the course material, conducting a certain amount of laboratory classes based on studying a certain case study, as they say, certain stories of a fictional company, as if the interest of this company is that they launch satellites from Ukraine.  When I work in Kazakhstan, they always ask me why, actually in Ukraine, we have Baikonur :) So, this is one of the options. <br><br>  <b>ITIL in the form of Formula 1 racing</b> <br><br>  And second, the one we use most often due to the zest that is in it.  And the highlight - we call it (sometimes you can hear the "game") <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/muk/blog/149326/">business simulation</a> .  If it is correct to say what the meaning of this game or business simulation is ... In this version of the course we use business simulation as laboratory work, that is, a certain business game that forces you, as a group of students, to require you to build the simplest control chain of four links.  The simplest chain, naturally, from business to IT.  Or from IT to business.  In the process of building this chain: first, it is done in real time using both computer simulations and some printed materials.        , -,     ,  -,       -,            ,     ,   ,  ,       IT,   ,        ,           ,    .  ,   ,   ,             ,  ,    .  ,   -          ,      .    ,   ,  ,     ,                .   ,    ,        ,                 . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/786/13f/ae2/78613fae2ab845f2a5a6da1836a52e12.jpg"><br><br>      (  ,   -),   IT,    ¬´-1¬ª,      .  ,    IT-,        ,  :   (, ,   -),  ,      .    ,       ,     ,      .  ,    IT,    IT-,     ,        ,        .

Will we be in the process of learning to solve all the problems facing your organization during the three or five days that the course continues? I think the obvious answer is no. If it were all so simple, universal happiness would have been achieved. Therefore, training provides a base, but training is not a substitute for consulting services. Sometimes people ask me (lately very often, almost always) questions: here, in our company, this is happening in such and such and such a way - what should be by the rules? In most cases, there are some general tips that should be more or less applicable, and we are always ready to share them. However, it must be understood that training is not a substitute for consulting services that will develop a model for you.Training will give basic knowledge on the basis of which you, applying your experience, carrying out some consistent steps, you can achieve the desired result. Nevertheless, as an aid after training for work, it is actually with your organization that we can offer a number of consulting services as the next steps, and in principle they can be quite short and simple, giving such quick links ‚Äî short ones such quick results that require relatively little time and effort, but give visible results.Nevertheless, as an aid after training for work, it is actually with your organization that we can offer a number of consulting services as the next steps, and in principle they can be quite short and simple, giving such quick links ‚Äî short ones such quick results that require relatively little time and effort, but give visible results.Nevertheless, as an aid after training for work, it is actually with your organization that we can offer a number of consulting services as the next steps, and in principle they can be quite short and simple, giving such quick links ‚Äî short ones such quick results that require relatively little time and effort, but give visible results.</font></font><br><br>          ,    ,  - ,          ,             .  ,           - ,     ,       IT.     ,  ,  -,  ,        ,          .  , , ,   IT-:      ,    ,      ,     ?     ,             , ,       .   .
