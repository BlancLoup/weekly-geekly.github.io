  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Girl accused of killing her daughter, searched Google for ‚Äúone hundred percent strangulation‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The death of two-year-old Kaylee became the main topic of American media in 2011, when the country watched her mother Casey Anthony's attempts to mislead law enforcement and she was still found not guilty.  Kaylee went missing on June 16, 2011, and her body was found only on December 11.  Her mother‚Äôs defense claimed that Kaylee had drowned, and despite the fact that Casey Anthony was found guilty of providing false information to the police four times, she was found not guilty of the murder. <br><br>  However, last week, the local television station WKMG reported that the police reached the key evidence, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/25/google-search-history-murder-evidence/">writes</a> TechCrunch.  Someone entered Google‚Äôs request for ‚Äúone hundred percent suffocation‚Äù (fool-proof suffocation) from the computer of the Anthony family on June 16, the day of the disappearance of Kaylee.  Initially, an assumption was made that Casey‚Äôs father could enter a search query, but then it turned out that the search was completed an hour after he came to work, and that Casey herself most likely entered the query. <br><br>  A jury trial might not have justified Casey Anthony if he knew that she was looking for "one hundred percent suffocation" on the last day that Kaylee was seen alive.  This is the latest example where Google‚Äôs search history can be a proof in a criminal case.  But this time the digital traces were discovered too late, and the suspect was already free. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Previously, Google search history has already been used in evidence of crimes.  In 2005, Mac developer Robert Petrik was convicted of killing his wife when he discovered that he was googling ‚Äúneck snap break‚Äù, uploaded a document called ‚Äú22 ways to kill a man with his bare hands‚Äù (22 ways to kill a man with your bare hands) and investigated how deep the lake was, where his wife‚Äôs body was later found.

      In 2006, Justin Barber was sentenced to life imprisonment for killing his wife on the beach.  Previously, he was looking for "Florida and divorce" (Florida &amp; divorce), as well as the words trauma, shot and right side of the chest (trauma, gunshot, right chest).  He also downloaded and then deleted the song ‚ÄúUsed To Love Her‚Äù by Guns N 'Roses, which says ‚ÄúI used to love her,‚Äù but I had to kill her. <br><br>  Until now, the search history on Google on the computer to the Anthony family has not been studied well enough.  It seems that detectives and the police can be useful training not only in taking typos and DNA samples, but also working with digital evidence.  And soon you can expect the appearance of a mobile search history and other evidence from smartphones in the materials of criminal cases.  However, law enforcement agencies should be careful not to unreasonably violate people's privacy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160185/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160185/</a></p>
