    <h4>  Menu </h4><br>  In drawing up the menu, we focused on your advice, comments and survey results.  We tried to take into account most of the wishes, but, naturally, we could miss something or not notice, so we will be extremely grateful for the comments in the comments.  Basically, they were guided not by quantity but by quality, several well-prepared dishes are much better than a long list <br><br><h5>  The drinks </h5><br>  Let's start with the most important component of the menu - beer.  Five sorts of beer are planned: Hugarden, Guiness, Bellevue Creek, Heinicen, and Vasileoostrovskoye Dark.  According to my observations, the first two are the most adequate and pleasant to the taste, the third was added at the request of the beautiful half of the IT industry, while the latter are focused on IT-youth. <br>  Approximate prices for beer: 120-250 rubles <br><br>  Naturally, we will have wine, brandy, whiskey, tequila and champagne (how not to celebrate the release).  The range will not be huge, but we promise that everything will be of high quality and well chosen. <br><br>  There were a lot of requests for good, not from tea bags, tea and coffee.  Naturally, we could not ignore requests from future visitors (especially since I myself like to sit with a cup of good tea or coffee).  As a result, we expect to include in the menu 3 types of teas (including Chinese, for which a lot of people called for), classic coffee options (espresso, lat, American, etc.) and hot chocolate. <br>  Our knowledge in this area is not very great, would be grateful to people who are ready to advise coffee machines and dishes for tea, as well as help with the choice of specific varieties of teas.  So far we have draft options, but I would like to hear the opinion of experts. <br>  Approximate prices for tea: 180 - 250 per teapot <br>  For coffee: 90 - 180 rubles <br><br>  Of course, we will have juice and fruit juice.  It will probably be even water. <br><br><h5>  Food </h5><br>  Based on our "bar" experience, we decided to dwell on a pair of classic steaks (chicken, salmon, pork) and salads (Caesar, Greek, fruit).  Naturally, there will be dumplings "Odminskie", without them nowhere. <br>  Food prices: 200-350 rubles <br>  Prices for salads: 200-250 rubles <br><br>  Desserts will be a little (ice cream, cocktails), without exotics. <br><br><h5>  Snacks </h5><br>  All that you used to see in bars will be with us.  Cheese sticks (in the Tower, by the way, are wonderful, if anyone knows), croutons and chicken wings.  We will try to cook everything at home, I hope, we will do without an ambulance. <br><br><h4>  Facilities Map </h4><br>  As we promised, we lay out a <a href="http://g.co/maps/q5cvq">map</a> , on the basis of which we were looking for a suitable place for our bar. <br><br>  We will be grateful if you help us to expand and supplement it. <br><br><h4>  A couple of words about the logo </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/172/816/428/172816428451a1aee63a5ec3038e0b66.jpg"><br>  There were many questions about the logo of our institution.  Why Guy Fox?  What does he have to do with it?  First, we were looking for a well-known mark in the IT community.  Secondly, our logo should reflect the spirit of freedom that will be in our bar.  As a result, we stopped at the mask of Guy Fawkes, who now, in my opinion, personifies the free Internet and is closest to our ideals. <br><br>  The implementation of the volumetric logo was made by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/inteo/" class="user_link">inteo</a> , for which many thanks to him and tea. <br><br><h4>  Presently </h4><br>  - a ready-made business plan (with all sorts of cool revolutions like ‚Äúwaiting for risky discounted expenses during revaluation‚Äù) <br>  - a couple of meetings with potential investors <br>  - a couple of rooms in mind <br>  - interior designers (and exterior) <br>  - cocktail card (which we will keep secret) <br>  - fully reviewed legal issues <br><br>  <b>Wait is not long.</b> <br><br>  We remind about <a href="http://devbar.ru/">our site</a> and about the project <a href="https://twitter.com/">twitter</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143389/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143389/</a></p>
