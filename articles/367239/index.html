  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How we came up with an unusual use for Amazon IoT Button and forced the secretary to lose a few pounds</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In October of this year, we went to Las Vegas for the Amazon re: Invent conference and brought back one of the latest Amazon innovations ‚Äî the beta version of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/iot/button/">IoT Button</a> ‚Äúmagic button‚Äù.  Amazon launched the sale of this wonderful gadget just a month ago, according to the idea, it should help lazy housewives to replenish stocks of any economic nonsense with one touch - diapers, powders, detergents, and so on.  The button is mounted on any flat surface, is configured using a mobile application and after clicking sends the order to Amazon.  The next morning, the courier delivers the goods under your door, everyone is happy and satisfied.  But what to do with this thing in Ukraine ?! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f08/c2b/b88/f08c2bb8810c4919af366742dfed8e6b.jpg"><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Spoiler</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In the last paragraph, we will tell you how to get 10 buttons for free. </div></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Amazon honestly admits that they don‚Äôt really know how people will use this button.  Ordering home goods is only one of its functions, the API of the button is open to third-party programs and in fact it can be customized as you please.  At first we wanted to adapt it for Privat24, but then another, more amusing idea was born. <br><br>  PrivatBank's Deputy Chairman Alexander Vityaz, more than a dozen times a day, addresses his assistant with the same type of request: bring tea, go to his office and pick up guests.  Do you remember the <a href="http://ain.ua/2015/11/24/617548">story about a programmer</a> who automated all aspects of his life, from excuses to his wife and ending with replies to annoying clients?  So we, too, are not done with a finger!  Why write identical messages to the chat every time or call the secretary‚Äôs mobile phone?  You can make everything easier and more fun.  Moreover, Olga has long wanted to lose a few extra pounds.

The configuration process itself took a little more than half an hour: we drew a simple front-end in the Sender messenger and described the logic of the operation of the button based on the Corezoid OS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b1/2ae/e8e/5b12aee8ead24a1885f5758d0f79ecca.png"><br><br>  Sender is our own instant messenger that allows you to create robots using visual programming methods.  To create a frontend, we registered a company in Sender, after which we went to the ‚ÄúBusiness‚Äù section of the messenger itself and added this company to our contacts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cb/0fa/935/4cb0fa9354cb493db16aa893cf076b11.png"><br><br>  After that we went to Corezoid, found a section with the name of our company (it appeared automatically after the first item was completed) and created a process in it that would be responsible for the exchange of messages between Olga and Vityaz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d8/3eb/1cc/5d83eb1cca854383a7ba1f51b678ba9b.png"><br><br>  I do not describe the creation of the process in detail, you can download it from this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwFbc8yBYziHdmVwelRhUUhCVUU/view%3Fusp%3Dsharing">link</a> and thus repeat our sequence of actions.  The finished process is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e5/a85/45e/9e5a8545ee964bb1b9c4bb8b327ddeb6.png"><br><br>  Green nodes are the start of the process, blue ones are its current conditions.  The button has three types of pressing: single click, double click and long press.  A separate process branch is created for each of the click options.  After sending the command, Olga receives a message in the chat with a request to perform one of three actions.  She presses the ‚ÄúGo‚Äù button, Vityaz receives a message in the Olga ‚Äúmessenger‚Äù messenger and he knows that his request will be completed soon. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f08/f10/d72/f08f10d7223c486d9d89505a0d39aa68.jpg"></div><br><br>  Special attention should be paid to the creation of the frontend.  The visual part of our application was created in the "Form Designer" of the Sender messenger.  Here is the process of drawing buttons.  In order to add them to the form, you need to drag the button with the left mouse button and give it a name. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf6/ba5/67f/cf6ba567f59044738111c84907a9f67c.png"><br><br>  Similarly, we drew other visual elements. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c7/ccd/3db/5c7ccd3db9ac4036a479e2a5075a73d4.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d0/c69/34c/6d0c6934cac0435785643cdf41850bad.png"></div><br><br>  And messages for Vityaz that Olga received his task. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8cd/9e2/8ea/8cd9e28eaa244e6493040429b19cb53b.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/359/c55/dc8/359c55dc888d407b8a6b50b68fb6610a.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd3/bcc/45e/cd3bcc45ec204800b6b91e999b49f7fc.png"></div><br><br>  In such an unusual way, we have found the use of a novelty from Amazon.  Vityaz was so pleased with this ‚Äúregime of God‚Äù that he began to drink 30% more tea and take twice as many guests.  Olga's cherished dream come true - to lose weight by a couple of pounds and tea suppliers to increase sales :) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f3/8b2/552/4f38b2552058416b9f1457a93addae6f.jpg"></div><br><br>  We still haven't figured out how to use this button in the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù way - so far we have only crazy ideas come to mind.  For example, to teach her with one touch to order a taxi or pizza, manage some smart gadgets or something else. <br><br>  Or maybe you think of something fun and useful?  We are ready to sponsor this action :) <br><br>  It became so interesting to us what options the Amazon IoT Button can have of using it, that we are ready to present a set of 10 buttons to the author of the best idea implemented on the basis of the Corezoid OS.  The device itself costs a modest $ 5 and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/%3Fnode%3D10667898011%26sort%3Ddate-desc-rank%26lo%3Ddigital-text">is available for ordering</a> on the Amazon website, and you can share your processes on my email timur.vorona at gmail.com.  You can also write to him with requests to share the process.  We will determine the winner on January 31, 2016 and we will announce in the comments to this post. <br><br>  Upd: in the last paragraph, I meant gifts to the author of the finished solution, which is implemented and launched :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367239/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367239/</a></p>
