They work in industry, help in everyday life, but despite this, they are not too common.  Soulless cars, as people have called them for a long time, will never become human friends.  These are only temporary assistants.  Given the increasing number of people, robots will be in demand only for specialized purposes and then - until the person himself does not get the opportunity to perform these tasks.  And that's why. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Heartless cars </h4><br>  In the process of work, a person needs to communicate, you need a source of personalized information with simultaneous analysis.  It is pleasant to person to discuss and empathize.  A living person can change under the influence of external factors.  As it was said in the film ‚ÄúI am a robot‚Äù, random errors in the code give the robots humanity, which, overlapping each other, produce unpredictable changes. <br><br><blockquote>  Random code segments that, bundled together, form unexpected protocols. </blockquote><br>  Errors in the code appear in the process of writing it by man.  When a person tries to change the created algorithm on the basis of information received from outside, he wants to simplify, facilitate and improve the laid algorithm, breaking the rules.  This is the basis of creativity.  Since childhood, every person has a set of rules laid down by parents and the environment, which should be followed.  Each one is different, each has a different degree of importance and evaluation criteria.  If for one person to deceive the controller in the subway is unacceptable, then another calmly can go to a massacre.  Everyone knows the expression "How many people - so many opinions."  And the code will be written by a limited number of people, and in order to make the robot similar in behavior to a person, it will be necessary to lay the possibility of self-transformation and change according to the influence of the external environment.  At that moment, when someone first lays a similar opportunity in the code, a huge wave of public indignation will immediately arise.  People are simply simply afraid of the possibility of a possible self-reproduction of the militant-minded horde of electro-mechanics and the project will be blocked.  How at one time blocked human cloning.

    <h4>  2. Assistants in hazardous conditions </h4><br>  A lot of robots are used in manufacturing, in the mining industry, in everyday life and medicine.  The reason is simple and banal: due to their physical limitations, a person is forced to transfer work to machines.  Robots-welders can work around the clock, well coordinated and without mistakes, they do not have their own trade union, they do not need to pay wages, insurance or compensation for disability and pensions.  Robotic sappers are used quite widely, as cheap and with an error in the work will suffer only a piece of iron.  The operator, being far away and having high qualifications, who has spent his life on improving skills, will remain safe and extract life experience without meaningless self-harm. <br><br><h4>  3. Replacing manual labor </h4><br>  Robots will be able to replace manual labor only partially.  Even in spite of the positive economic effect of the introduction of robots on production, albeit a screwdriver, in the early stages large capital investments are required.  A young firm in most cases is limited in funds and in the early stages it is easier for it to attract a living person by paying a payout in a month, whereas in the case of a robot you must either pay immediately or go into debt and ask for more money to start. <br><br><h4>  4. Creative class </h4><br>  No matter how well robotics develops in the world, they will always remain a tool.  Even if an engineer develops a robot that can draw portraits, he lays in him a certain algorithm that he invented himself.  And, in fact, even such a ‚Äúcreative‚Äù robot remains just a tool.  A true creative is an engineer. <br><br>  From all that has been written, it can be concluded that every year people have more and more tools for self-expression, while boring and routine operations are outsourced to machines.  Revolution robots will not. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362079/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362079/</a></p>
