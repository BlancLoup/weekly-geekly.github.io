We felt unexpected support from both clients, and from investors and simply wishing to help us.  Charge of enthusiasm was enough - we not only did not bend, but also achieved a lot.

      What happened?  Briefly. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Progress </h4><br>  - Now on our account more than 160 completed specials.  orders of varying degrees of complexity and a lot of people we just helped to find and buy products of interest to them. <br>  - We got a good investor in Russia, which allows us to develop even faster than the previously planned pace. <br>  - We have got an office in walking distance from Park Kultury metro station.  We do not yet have the opportunity to organize a point of issue here, but we are always happy to go to meet customers - we issue goods right in the subway or other places nearby for free. <br>  - We have signed a contract with the well-known company Monoprice, whose products meet all quality standards - it is not by chance that this is one of the largest players in the US cable market.  The first large delivery has already been made and you can already see the goods from Monoprice on the showcase of our online store.  Read more about why we created it and why it is this way. <br>  - In addition, we have concluded supply contracts with several Russian firms. <br>  - The most important thing for us is the product.  Therefore, we are preparing for the release of interesting "things" that for various reasons are either poorly or not represented at all in our market. <br>  - The price / product quality ratio is one of the best on the market (the best in many positions), and will continue to improve. <br><br><h4>  Problems and Failures </h4><br>  - Our main failure at the moment - has not yet been able to make an interactive engine for automatic configuration and selection of cable.  The reasons are trivial: there was not enough programming resources and time.  Our staff is still small.  However, we have some groundwork in this direction and constantly developing TK.  (See below for jobs.) <br>  - Prices.  Unfortunately, we can not immediately please you with Western prices.  The main reason: we can not immediately go against the market.  We know how to change this situation, but it takes time. <br><br><h4>  More about the site </h4><br>  We reworked the <a href="http://shnurovik.ru/">stub</a> .  Externally, it is slightly changed, but has become more functional. <br>  In the top menu you can see three new links: Store, Blog and Feedback. <br><br><h5>  1. Shop </h5><br>  This link will take you to our store <a href="http://www.superprovod.ru/">superprovod.ru</a> . <br>  Its name differs from the name of our project and here's why: this is not what we are striving for.  It is rather a technical necessity. <br><br>  Mainly, it was created for the convenience of placing our products on various trading platforms, ease of keeping records of goods and, of course, for the convenience of those customers who already know what they need. <br><br>  This is a full-fledged online store.  Works courier delivery and there is the possibility of self-delivery.  You can easily find and buy there the entire range of goods that we have at the moment. <br>  The presence of this store in no way cancels the implementation of specials.  orders.  It only simplifies and speeds up our work. <br>  We hope that you will understand us correctly. <br><br><h5>  2. Blog </h5><br>  About a month ago, our project had a blog - <a href="http://blog.shnurovik.ru/">blog.shnurovik.ru</a> , where there are already many subject articles.  It is updated regularly.  We try to talk about something new and that interests our customers. <br>  In the near future you will be able to read about the comparative tests that we will conduct.  This will be a new product, and a comparison of expensive cables and devices with cheap ones, and much more.  I think some readers of Habr may be interested. <br><br><h5>  3. Feedback </h5><br>  This FAQ - <a href="http://feedback.shnurovik.ru/">feedback.shnurovik.ru</a> . <br>  Here you can find answers to the questions that were asked to us, and ask your questions.  You can also participate in discussions of your questions. <br><br>  Like a blog, this FAQ helps us accumulate and structure information. <br><br><h4>  Jobs, requests, offers </h4><br>  We are ready to cooperate with programmers and designers to create a widget for automatic selection of suitable products and the overall design of the project.  There are developments in this area until it was possible to bring them to the proper level. <br><br>  We will still be happy to communicate with everyone.  We are pleased to hear your criticism, suggestions and suggestions for further development. <br><br>  PS: <br>  I am writing a post almost from a plane to Hong Kong, where I am flying as part of a working trip to develop a project.  More on this later :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117247/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117247/</a></p>
