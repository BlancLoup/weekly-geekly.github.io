  <section class="page js-page"><h1>3Par InServ Architecture</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, we continue to get acquainted with the innovations in the line of HP storage systems, which appeared after the acquisition of 3Par.  Let me remind you that the first date took place <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/110204/">right here</a> - there we learned about the past life of 3Par products and made the first impression.  Now we will get even closer and look at the subtleties of their architecture. <br><br>  Now the 3Par InServ lineup consists of four systems: two F-Series, supporting up to 384 disks, and two T-Series, which support up to 1280 disks.  If traditional modular disk arrays (for example, HP StorageWorks EVA) are based on two controllers combined into a cluster, the 3Par InServ array architecture already supports up to eight controllers, which together form a fully connected multi-node full-mesh cluster. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, this architecture provides a more flexible load balancing between controllers and gives more opportunities for scaling the performance of the disk array.  It also provides some insurance in the event that one of the controllers fails.  For the same purpose, the Persistent Cache mechanism is used, which mirrors the controller's cache memory. <br><br>  The second feature of the hardware of 3Par arrays is the use of an ASIC chip in each controller, which at the iron level implements additional useful functionality.  For example, thin provisioning (‚Äúthin initialization‚Äù), which we will talk about further, as well as independent processing of control commands and data streams, allowing an array to efficiently process different I / O streams in parallel: both with a large amount of data and with a large number of transactions .

    <h5>  Where "thin", there and ... solid benefits </h5><br>  Over the past three years, <i>thin provisioning</i> support has become a standard feature for middle and high-end arrays.  But it was 3Par that, in 2003, was the first storage system in the industry to implement this functionality, incorporating it into the architecture of the first generation of its disk arrays.  Since then, the company has constantly improved its thin provisioning, ahead of other manufacturers. <br><br>  In addition to the main purpose of thin provisioning - the dynamic allocation of capacity from a virtual pool to applications - 3Par engineers implemented thin conversion and thin reclamation (probably, thin processing).  The first is used to quickly migrate data from a traditional disk array to a thin provisioning array without sacrificing performance.  And the second is to return unused allocated capacity to the virtual pool. <br><br>  The use of these ‚Äúthin‚Äù technologies greatly increases the efficiency of storage system resources, saves the administrator‚Äôs work time and eliminates the need to purchase additional disks for future use. <br><br><h5>  From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs </h5><br>  For virtualization of disk space in 3Par arrays, a three-level structure is used: <br><ul><li>  At the base of the structure are 256-megabyte <i>segments</i> into which physical disks are broken. </li><li>  Segments are grouped into <i>logical volumes</i> based on the level of service required and data protection.  Within one logical volume there can be several <i>regions</i> with different types of disks (Fiber Channel, SATA or SSD), RAID levels and degree of fault tolerance.  In this case, the logical volume may include segments from different physical disks located on different disk shelves of the array. </li><li>  In turn, logical volumes are grouped into <i>virtual disks</i> , which "see" the servers connected to the array. </li></ul>  Automatic data migration between different regions within a logical volume helps to achieve an optimal balance between data value for business applications and the cost of physical disks.  For example, according to 3Par data, 95% of I / O operations are performed with 3% of the data stored on a disk array.  Therefore, it makes sense to place this data on the fastest SSDs.  The cost of storing one gigabyte of valuable data at the same time will be maximum, but the cost of the entire array can be balanced by using cheaper interfaces for less used data.  And performance in most cases will remain at a very high level. <br><br><h5>  Provider note </h5><br>  The system of <i>virtual domains</i> allows you to cut a disk array into isolated <i>virtual private arrays</i> at the logical level.  This feature is very popular with service providers, as it can be used to guarantee the safe storage of data belonging to different clients (or different divisions of the corporation) on one disk array.  For example, Savvis, one of the largest US service providers, has been using 3Par products since 2004 and installed more than thirty InServ systems with a total capacity of more than 2 PB in 28 of its data centers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="3Par InServ Disk Array" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/62ebd3af/88ed4af8/4c2921ce/9c7f7efe.jpg"></div><br>  ‚ÄúIt was nice to meet you!‚Äù Say HP 3Par arrays.
