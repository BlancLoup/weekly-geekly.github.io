  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Perfect gadget backpack for father family</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Welcome to the <a href="http://www.icover.ru/">iCover</a> blog.  Two years ago I wrote a big topic ‚Äúthe <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/shopozzcom/blog/236953/">right bag for the right geek</a> ‚Äù, which received a good response and became a ‚Äútopic for good‚Äù because of the large number of excellent comments.  Since then, the topic of bags and backpacks, I do not leave, regularly trying something new. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/471/7a7/aa7/4717a7aa749a4358b610f251aea8cdfa.jpg"><br><br>  My current <b>Booq Squezze</b> backpack is a great one, with one small exception - it's small.  In other words, it‚Äôs great to walk around the city with him if you need to put a laptop there, a few EDC-like things like a multitool and a flashlight, a spare test bank, plus throw out a book and a magazine.  And that's all.  Something more climbs there with difficulty.

      And since I am the father of two small children (yes, I am also the author of the topic ‚Äú <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/137107/">child in the family of geeks</a> ‚Äù) and we regularly go somewhere with the whole family, recently there was a question of buying something more roomy.  And I began to dig. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  First, we formalize the requirements.  Some of them are very specific or boring, but most fathers will understand me.  So: <br><br><ol><li>  The backpack should be roomy.  So that all things for a flight and a long walk, including 2-3 beach towels, should be put in there. </li><li>  All paternal gadgets should be placed in the backpack, and, moreover, they should be protected as much as possible.  Usually I take a trip: a laptop, a charger for it, a smartphone, a power bank, a Kindle, a son's tablet, a notebook, pens, a pile of wires. </li><li>  The pocket for the laptop should be separate, providing quick access to it.  As a rule, it is necessary at airports, because  need to get a laptop for inspection.  If the pocket is inside the main compartment, then it is very difficult to stuff a technique into it. </li><li>  The backpack should have an outer pocket for a water bottle.  It is desirable two (if there are two children - it happens that it is undesirable for both to drink from the same bottle. For example, suddenly one of them is a little sick).  External - because the bottle is often needed, and take-open-close-put on a backpack is very uncomfortable.  Plus, it does not take away a place in the main department. </li><li>  It should have a carrying handle - standing in line for inspection or for boarding a train / bus, it is much more convenient to hold it in your hand by the handle. </li><li>  It should have a pocket on top, where it is convenient to put a poverbank and a cord for charging.  Why top?  Because sitting on a chair it is convenient to put a backpack between your legs and connect a phone or tablet with a relatively short wire.  Typically, such a pocket manufacturers positioned as a place for points.  Why not from below?  Downstairs, a power bank is much easier to be hit, and batteries are fragile and sometimes fire hazardous. </li><li>  It should have a convenient external pocket, with a bunch of pockets where it is easy to shove passports, Airbnb reservations and boarding for the whole family.  However, it must be safe. </li><li>  And the last: it should be beautiful, but made of practical, waterproof material. </li></ol><br><br>  These are the requirements.  The easiest thing turned out to be with the material - there is a great thing called ‚Äúballistic nylon‚Äù.  This is a very practical material, one of the varieties of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF">ripstop</a> , which was developed specifically for the military by DuPont.  And more precisely - for body armor.  A distinctive feature is durability, the fabric does not crawl after damage, plus it is resistant to dirt.  Did you see the movie Deadpool?  The costume of the main character is made of ballistic nylon.  You remember why. <br><br>  But with the rest of the points I had to tinker.  During the search, three things turned out: <br><br><ol><li>  A good thoughtful backpack can not cost less than $ 100.  If it is cheaper, then it was most likely imported at the old rate.  There are several nice models for Dakine with a lower price, but the normal functionality and the right fabric immediately brings the price closer to the one sounded above.  Alas. </li><li>  Most of my favorite manufacturers produce a lot of good models, but very few people meet all the stated requirements.  The hardest thing was having a bottle for water - in most cases it is such a formal pocket from which the bottle falls out stupidly.  For example, with the same Booq, I have not found a single model that suits me. </li><li>  China will not help us.  A search on Aliexpress led to the conclusion that the Chinese are actively engaged in copying Swissgear backpacks.  The most famous Chinese brand in this business is Swisswin. </li></ol><br><br>  What I (again, I personally) do not like about Swissgear.  Yes, it is large and comfortable, he has well thought out all the pockets, especially the side: we stick in the water, we hide it under the belt.  Wherever you look, this backpack has very high ratings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/395/325/6ad/3953256ad48e4b11a45639f47985b64d.jpg"><br><br>  But!  This same belt prevents normally open main compartment.  This is the first.  Secondly, he has a huge compartment for a laptop, which opens as a sandwich.  I do not need so much.  In those moments when I do not carry a laptop, the whole place is useless.  So under the laptop you need exactly as much as you need.  Plus, this design of the circular opening leads to an additional load on the zipper, which does not have a very good effect on durability. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/141/0f8/9a9/1410f89a9f5b4ccaa1411da8db15676a.jpg"><br><br>  Chinese copies add to the above the worst quality of the fabric, the worst quality of locks and an inexplicable fetish in the form of a pocket the size of a CD player and the mandatory output for headphones on the strap of a backpack - things are very strange in 2016. <br><br>  I have to say, I found an almost perfect backpack called the TLS Professional Slim Laptop Backpack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c00/e81/308/c00e81308da945be9e53805c8fde5e1e.jpg"><br><br>  Watch a short video (alas, in English) where it is described: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nxw6JdUeFX4&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhji5Ma0VGIcosmmFLMK2YzDAJcZHg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Of the benefits: <br><ul><li>  A cleaned pocket for a bottle (I have not zadolbal you with this bottle yet?) </li><li>  Pocket for wires and poverbank.  Unfortunately, it is downstairs, but it is hidden in a hard case and can be ‚Äúpulled out‚Äù, freeing up space inside. </li><li>  In the compartment for a laptop there is a spacer that allows you to make a backpack thicker / thinner depending on the current target. </li><li>  It has a presentable appearance, allowing it to be used, including as a business backpack with strict clothing. </li></ul><br><br>  Disadvantages (where without them): <br><ul><li>  Not for sale in Russia.  This means that the price plus shipping cost.  That with the current course becomes sensitive. </li><li>  The outer pocket contains too many pockets with zippers, which hardly anyone would use to the fullest.  Well, the extra lightning a few weight design.  I understand the lack of so-so - but nonetheless. </li></ul><br><br>  Alas, I needed a backpack faster than in a month, so I continued to dig.  The second and third options were the Ogio backpacks. <br><br>  The first model is <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/ogio_bandit_111074_323_ryukzak_dlya_macbook_17_blizzard/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcm%26utm_campaign%3Dgtbackpack">Ogio Bandit</a> .  What it is good for is: a protected compartment for a 15 ‚Äùlaptop (they write for 17), but in reality most 17-inch laptops will not fit there.  But 15 "- just right. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e6/71b/ca8/3e671bca81a74f1ca796fec2ac1e98e4.jpg"><br><br>  Plus, a large number of external and internal pockets, a convenient pocket for a bottle (yes, again, a bottle), which, like TSL, is quilted, with the neck of the bottle fastened with a special elastic band.  The outer pocket, potentially used for documents, has two zippers that allow you to hang a combination lock.  Plus, there is a convenient organazer for things. <br><br>  By the way, even from the chips - on most Ogio backpacks, each pocket is equipped with a patch that shows what the manufacturer has invented this pocket for.  At first it is very convenient - no need to puzzle.  But then it is a bit annoying - all the time stumble upon this hint with a glance, especially if you redistribute the functionality of the pockets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d57/482/234/d574822340cc40739253050e25f03084.jpg"><br><br>  Disadvantages: a little scary - here affects the motorcycle direction of the company Ogio.  When you put it on, you become a bit like a ninja turtle.  Not very comfortable top pocket and completely useless zipper pocket at the bottom.  The manufacturer positions it as a pocket for a camera, but I wouldn‚Äôt place it there - soprut or you can easily break it. <br><br>  In general, I would take this backpack if it were not for the <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/ryukzak_ogio_squadron_15_pack_111073_20_metallic/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcm%26utm_campaign%3Dgtbackpack">Ogio Squadron</a> .  In the end, I bought it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da9/65c/85b/da965c85b92748108813b1548395e682.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the same functionality that Bandit has, it looks subjectively better, plus it has two important features: <br><br><ul><li>  He has two belts.  The manufacturer naively assumes that a skateboard will be attached here.  But, guys, I spent many years with a similar snowboard backpack from Salomon and believe me, these things are much more useful than they seem.  The simplest application is to take away a jacket, sweater, or any child‚Äôs clothes.  Even if the main branch is occupied.  Even here you can cling all sorts of things such as a children's life jacket, arm ruffles, and so on and so forth. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/820/4f3/94e/8204f394e711459c9e29e4158a9bef14.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  See this hole near the belt at the top and bottom?  Here you can hang a carbine and further increase the functionality.  For example, I hung a bucket with which the child was playing on the beach on such a thing (you remember that I am also a dad, yes?).  The bucket is healthy, it doesn‚Äôt climb into the backpack (and nafig there needs this sand), but outside it‚Äôs a nice thing.  Also on the carbine you can hang a lot of other useful things. </li></ul><br><br>  Disadvantages: it does not have an office design at all (hello, motorcycles) and it does not have a retainer for my favorite bottle, despite the fact that the side pockets are not very deep.  But I decided that I could make a slimming gum myself.  I really liked the idea <br><br>  By the way, if the current post is of interest, I can write down a separate review of this backpack.  Write in the comments if necessary. <br><br>  <b>Step to the side of appearance</b> <br><br>  In the process of searching, I considered two more options, which I dismissed due to the prevalence of appearance over functionality.  However, this does not make these backpacks much worse, so I would like to talk about them.  Still, the production of Ogio - an amateur.  Both backpacks are manufactured by Thule, which is highly valued in our brand-oriented country.  Plus, their appearance is well combined with office clothing. <br><br>  The first is called <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/thule_subterra_tsdp_115gn_ryukzak_dlya_noutbuka_15_green/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcm%26utm_campaign%3Dgtbackpack">THULE SUBTERRA</a> and he is damn handsome. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf5/ec7/9a0/bf5ec79a069748e598f5f3278878014d.jpg"><br>  <b>The rare case when the photo thing is slightly worse than the original</b> <br><br>  Because of the beauty, the pocket for glasses (read, the pocket for the bank) has shifted to the side, but all the basic functionality is present.  Alas, it is not very convenient to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7cyKW9yb_5I">open</a> , so I dismissed it as not the best option.  Although, I repeat, it is very beautiful.  If you need a backpack, first of all noticeable, but at the same time very functional, this is a good option. <br><br>  Well, the second option - <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/thule_stravan_tsbp_115g_ryukzak_dlya_macbook_15_grey/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcm%26utm_campaign%3Dgtbackpack">Thule Str√§van</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d1/fb3/e77/4d1fb3e770404534b4b78f9d5fd5a1b6.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to comfortable and deep pockets, the backpack has two belts from below, in which it is also convenient to pull down something that does not fit in the main compartment. <br><br>  There was another option with Ogio Renegade, but it is really very big and the functionality, IMHO, is too much.  With comparable money, I liked <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/thule_stravan_tsbp_115g_ryukzak_dlya_macbook_15_grey/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcm%26utm_campaign%3Dgtbackpack">Thule Str√§van more</a> . <br><br>  I thank the company <a href="http://www.icover.ru/blog/">iCover</a> , on the old friendship provided a place for publication in the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/icover/">corporate blog</a> .
