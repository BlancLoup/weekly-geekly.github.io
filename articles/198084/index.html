The first platform for learning in micro-course format</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Resident 2 cycle of the <a href="http://happyfarm.com.ua/">Happy Farm start-up incubator</a> , who wants to say a special thank you, it was thanks to the acceleration program and to attract a lot of Silicon Valley mentors that it was possible to develop a new training concept for Twitter generation, micro-courses, from scratch. <br><br><h5>  <b>What are micro courses?</b> </h5><br><br>  The rapidly growing field of online learning faces a number of problems, one of which is next - students do not complete online courses.  According to data from various sources, the percentage of failures reaches 94%. <br>  Why do people lose motivation and quit?  Our answer is too long. <br>  Long online courses provide a significant amount of knowledge.  Yes, this is true, but now only the author decides how much they need to fit into the course. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dab/971/b1c/dab971b1c14960285d1d122423b77913.jpg" alt="image">

    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>  Micro course <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>  Normal online course <br><br>  Is it possible to implement a more flexible approach when a user studies only what is interesting to him, while being freely oriented in the information space?  Reminds the Internet, is not it? <br>  We are not talking about a service that does the same thing, but better.  We are talking about a new micro-course format that provides previously inaccessible opportunities for both students and authors. <br><br>  <b>Students</b> <br><br>  1. Fast learning. <br>  A micro course is an independent unit of knowledge that can be learned in less than an hour.  Or take a micro-lesson, spending only a few minutes on it.  A person does not have time to lose interest and concentration.  For a short time, the learning efficiency is maximum.  At the same time, a person knows in advance that he will spend only a few minutes, so he allows himself to disconnect from other affairs and concentrate on learning.  At the same time, having completed the course, he is satisfied with the result achieved.  The pleasure of completing comes much faster and motivates to further learning, unlike regular online courses, when leaving a few courses a person can lose confidence in online learning as a whole. <br>  2. Surfing. <br>  Each lesson of each course has a link to a micro course, which is a detailed version of this lesson.  A more detailed course can also be detailed.  Thus, a person can study each topic as deeply as it is interesting and necessary at the moment.  In parallel with the author's extensions, there may be micro-courses by other authors on the same topic.  It depends on the author‚Äôs account settings. <br>  3. Micro courses on request. <br>  Interest-driven learning and request-driven teaching.  If a person, looking through the lesson, did not find a more detailed version, he can in one click send a request to the author to create a more detailed micro course and get it within a few days.  It's like clicking like.  When the author releases the requested micro course, the requester receives a notification and a link to it. <br>  4. The combination of free and low-cost content. <br>  Each micro course is either free or costs much less than usual.  Thus, the user gets the opportunity to pay only for the knowledge that he needs now.  On the other hand, if a micro course is not suitable for a person, but he will understand it much faster and will be less sorry for the time spent. <br><br>  <b>Lecturers.</b> <br><br>  1. Fast and free creation of learning content. <br>  A micro course can be created literally on the go or directly during work.  Enough to have a phone.  Lessons are recorded on camera, related materials, tests are added.  After downloading, micro courses are available from both the mobile application and the web.  At the same time, the cost of creating such a course is close to zero.  It's like Instagram for creating courses that allows you to create dozens of micro-courses. <br>  2. Curriculum based on user preferences. <br>  Notifications ‚ÄúI want more‚Äù from students are visible to the author, who, on the basis of these data, decides which micro course to create next.  The author spends his time creating a course, knowing how many consumers he already has and being able to predict how much they will add in a certain amount of time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/997/e9b/4a0/997e9b4a0bdc603786074f2c20fa0e31.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  3. Ability to grow your tree of knowledge. <br>  By attaching one micro-courses to others, the author grows his tree of knowledge, which, unlike the usual courses, is a reflection of his experience in general, and grows organically, along with the author. <br>  4. Latest information. <br>  The author can update the course at least every day, in accordance with the latest trends and taking into account feedback from students.  Micro-courses are living objects, thanks to the exceptional simplicity of creation and editing, they can be constantly improved and adjusted to the expectations of users. <br>  5. Flexible monetization system. <br>  The ability to create dozens of micro-courses gives room for sale models: <br>  - free basic courses, paid extensions; <br>  - Courses with free first lessons, full course paid; <br>  - free courses with paid additional materials; <br>  - sets of courses at a discount, etc. <br>  6. Corporate knowledge. <br>  Organizations, within themselves, can grow their own knowledge trees, the creation of which can be any employee.  It is no secret that a multitude of knowledge in organizations is transferred from one employee to another.  Micro courses allow you to collect, structure and store this information, thus being an additional highly effective tool for internal training. <br><br>  The format of micro courses allows you to incredibly simplify the transfer of knowledge from person to person.  We are sure that just like Twitter has opened a new communication concept, Coursmos will open a new page in online training. <br><br>  Do you know something useful?  Try to make your micro course, it's simple.  iOS application here: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coursmos/id692934231%3Fmt%3D8">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coursmos/id692934231?mt=8</a> <br><br>  Always happy to get feedback.
