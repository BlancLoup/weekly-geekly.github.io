  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Five Years School Data Analysis</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Exactly five years ago, Yandex announced the opening of the <a href="http://shad.yandex.ru/">School for Data Analysis</a> (SAD).  For us it was a serious, albeit risky step.  Today we can safely say that everything turned out.  We managed to create a strong master program that is valued in the professional community.  Now the competition in the ShAD is five to six people in place, as in a prestigious university.  On the birthday of the School, we want to remember how it all began. <br><br>  In the mid-2000s, it became clear that there are almost no specialists on the market that we need.  Many representatives of the Soviet school of data analysis, which was strong in the 60-70s, left the country.  Even VMIK or Mekhmat of Moscow State University did not give sufficient knowledge to solve problems related to data processing (texts, images, music, voice).  It was necessary to revive the scientific environment and grow a new generation of programmers.  And the talented guys in Russia have always been, no matter how much they leave from here. <br><br>  At first, we believed that life was in full swing with us, that there were students and graduate students who were engaged in analyzing data - they only needed to be searched.  We held several contests to analyze Internet data, but among their participants there were almost no undergraduate and graduate students.  Then we tried to negotiate with universities about creating courses that would train specialists for Yandex.  However, universities offered their programs and were not ready to develop new ones.  So gradually we came to the idea that you need to create your own school.  A huge role in its creation was played by Ilya Muchnik, Grigory Kondakov, Elena Bunin, Maxim Babenko.

The idea was to collect all the best that was in Soviet and Russian science bit by bit and pass this knowledge on to the young.  We invited leading Russian scientists to the SEC - both those who live in Russia and those who work abroad.  In addition, it was important for us to combine practice and theory in the training course.  Therefore, among the professors of the ShAD there are not only scientists, but also brilliant programmers who have won in international student programming competitions and prepared others for them.  In the five years of its existence, the School has released more than 170 people.  We hope that they will contribute to the development of Russian science.  And we are very pleased that more than 100 of our graduates have remained to work at Yandex. <br><br>  We are grateful to everyone who created the School.  First of all, our teachers are: Alexei Yakovlevich Chervonenkis, Albert Nikolaevich Shiryayev, Andrei Mikhailovich Raygorodsky, Evgeny Vitalyevich Shchepin, and <a href="http://shad.yandex.ru/staff/">many others</a> .  And of course, we want to thank all our students and <a href="http://shad.yandex.ru/seniors/">graduates</a> for their love for our common cause. <br><br>  <strong>Happy Birthday School!</strong> <br>  <em>Arkady Volozh and Ilya Segalovich</em> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e3b/803/3d4/e3b8033d40645412d3153283aa07c75c.gif" width="1" alt="."></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148443/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148443/</a></p>
