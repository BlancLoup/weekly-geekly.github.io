      Lumia 820 is more hardware (processor, memory, LTE), but it also costs more. <br>  The Lumia 620 is also slightly better than the TTX, but less screen and a third less capacious battery.  But replaceable.  But the phone is not yet sold, and the price at the beginning of sales is planned to be the same as in 8s today. <br>  By the way, at one time there were rumors about a model from HTC, similar in characteristics to the Lumia 820 (4.3 ", 1.5GHz, NFC), but I did not hear anything about the real incarnation. <br><br><h5>  Ergonomics </h5><br>  Standard controls for phones on WP8 - Home, Back, Search.  Right camera button and volume control.  Rear camera and LED flash.  On top - the power button and headphone jack.  Downstairs - microUSB. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/97c/746/ba8/97c746ba8fa4a49a2577b8b11633939f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/064/814/5f0/0648145f037f3935e0e5512ba2da173b.jpg"><br><br>  The phone is quite compact, it is comfortable in the hand.  4 "- this is the optimal screen size for me. Much more convenient than the current 5" + shovels.  The hardware button of the camera is a pity that they left it almost everywhere.  The flash can be used as a flashlight. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/70a/225/bc6/70a225bc64f8ac6fd87250ffae5c44cd.jpg"><br><br>  The battery is non-removable, so replacing the sim card and the memory card is simple - only the cover of the compartment must be unscrewed.  Not the most convenient, but much better than on HTC Mozart, where it was difficult to remove it without tools. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b6e/fc0/59b/b6efc059bdadb29283c570e5a6a0ff60.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Battery </h5><br>  1700 mAh, for a screen of this size is not bad.  My phone is the third day, because I still can not say how much he lives on a single charge.  I gather statistics - I‚Äôll add information, but it will take a couple of weeks. <br><br><h5>  OS and programs </h5><br>  Here I will not tell in detail, so fragmentary impressions. <br>  The new OS itself did not make much of an impression compared to 7.5.  Evolutionary development, rather pulls on a service pack. <br>  Finished some little things - and everything, perhaps.  This is from the user's point of view.  Inside, maybe everything was rebuilt, but outside it is not visible. <br><br>  Synchronization with Google did not go right away, said ‚Äúbad certificate, do you really want to synchronize with this nasty Google‚Äù? <br><br>  After setting up the synchronization, a letter was received in the mail about the initial configuration of the phone, the transfer of contacts from other phones, etc.  (under the picture - the full content of the letter).  Links are sent to <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/">www.windowsphone.com</a> , in the Russian section. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/cropped2/055/206/b32/055206b320b957f3cb6fe07890f92e97.png"></a> <br><br>  It became possible to connect the phone via cable, not only as USB Storage (like flash drives), but via MTP ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Transfer_Protocol">media transfer protocol</a> ).  All windows are recognized without drivers, for MacOS, as far as I know, there are drivers, for Linux, libmtp and mtpfs. <br>  You can upload supported video, music and office documents (doc, xls, pdf) to the phone itself.  Files of other formats can be copied, but the software does not see them. <br><br>  The office refuses to edit doc-files - ‚ÄúThe document is saved in the format 97-2003‚Äù, it opens only for reading.  Resave to docx does not provide. <br><br>  I do not see the forced binding to SkyDrive, the office normally works with local files, the programs have support for dropbox.  But at the system level - only SkyDrive. <br><br>  Download the file through the browser and give it to another program, in principle, it is possible, but not with all.  For example, downloading fb2.zip, the archive is being unpacked, but the system no longer knows what to do with fb2.  With epub the same story - trying to find a program to open in the market and breaks off.  And for pdf I found it and installed it (pdf reader was not initially installed). <br><br>  Multitasking has not yet been observed, although in the settings there is a list of programs that are allowed to work in the background.  Programs during care in the background are slowed down and not immediately restored.  The reader reopens the file, the browser reloads the page (if there are a dozen pictures there, the text may remember), ICQ (IM +) reconnects (although it works in the background - people see me online, messages come, although with some delay, especially jabber). <br><br>  With the amount of software, in principle, there are no special problems - the most popular programs already have versions for WP or quite decent counterparts (about 2/3 of my android ones).  But all these versions are simpler android, plus often they are just an interface to access an online service (Lingvo, Tripadvisor, yandex.kart ...), respectively, they don‚Äôt work without a network. <br><br><h5>  Opinion </h5><br>  A good smartphone for those who live in places with stable mobile Internet.  The hardware is very pleasant, in the hand is excellent, an interesting shape, a good color range.  But software is not so smooth, WP8 still gives the impression of an under-iphone.  To add at least a normal exchange of files between programs ... But in general the OS is moving in the right direction, it is a pity that it is unhurried. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162141/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162141/</a></p>
