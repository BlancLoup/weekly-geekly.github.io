Our goal is to educate the wider technical community and help people understand how they can contribute to and benefit from the OpenStack project.  Naturally, below is the point of view of the interviewee, not of Mirantis. <br><br>  The following is an interview with Michael Basnight, technical manager of the OpenStack Trove project. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Mirantis: Tell us about yourself.</b>

      Michael Basnayt: I am a leading engineer at Rackspace, working on the OpenStack project 24 hours 7 days a week.  I have been with Rackspace for over 7 years.  He was responsible for data analytics, cloud website hosting, large-scale provisioning systems, and now I'm working on Trove.  Thanks to Rackspace, now I can give 100% of my energy to an open source database.  I live in Berkeley, California, working either on the veranda of my house with a cup of coffee, or next to my wife and 10-month-old son Alexander. <br><br>  <b>Q: What is your relationship history with OpenStack?</b>  <b>Why do you participate in the project?</b> <br><br>  A: When we created Trove at Rackspace, neither I nor other developers thought about OpenStack.  We started to manipulate a full stack of Java, OSGI, Zookeeper, etc.  ... standard Java programs.  At that time, Rackspace decided to bet on OpenStack.  Seeing that our future is connected with OpenStack, I decided (being at that time a leading developer and manager) to roll back the tests we started to test the concept and start using the Nova controller as a provisioning mechanism.  We encountered some difficulties on our way, since the OpenStack initiative was only just beginning to develop.  But I had the opportunity to introduce changes to almost all OpenStack projects in the process of their development, and now we have a serious project on top of OpenStack, which can be added to any existing installation based on OpenStack. <br><br>  <b>Question: What are your responsibilities as a technical project manager for Trove?</b> <br><br>  Answer: Heh, good question.  This is almost a recipe.  I start with the basics of product ownership and management, so that the project concept evolves in the direction that is best for the community.  Adding a pinch of project management, developing a detailed plan and tracking who is working on what.  I mix and slowly add people management to make sure that they really fulfill their obligations in accordance with their promises.  I add a generous portion of code checking, a pinch of the code ‚Äú-1‚Äù and, if the CARRYOUT, when everything is ready, I glaze it all with what I develop myself. <br><br>  <b>Q: What is the role of Trove in OpenStack?</b>  <b>Why is the Trove project important?</b> <br><br>  Answer: The Trove project is important because data storage is important.  You can‚Äôt name a single project that doesn‚Äôt need to store or cache data.  Trove is a universal storage solution.  Whether it's Redis, a real-time data warehouse with a high degree of availability, or MySQL to store all the information about your pet store, or MongoDB to store Marconi telegraph messages.  The concept of Trove is to provide all this, to make the clusters set up and work online.  Trove also offers backup and recovery services implemented with it, and functions like automatic backup / restore at a certain point in time are currently under development. <br><br>  <b>Question: What is truly unique and breakthrough in the project Trove?</b> <br><br>  Answer: Trove is working on a huge number of experts in the field of data storage.  We have attracted key people from the community to implement a variety of projects and services.  Among them are the developers administering MySQL, starting with version 3.23.  We recruit people who wrote cluster deployment projects in MySQL.  We consult with Redis experts in the process of its implementation.  We are experts in the field of development and in the field of data storage and processing.  If we do not know how to do it, we know those who know it. <br><br>  <b>Question Tell us about the community Trove - who cooperates with you</b> <br><br>  Answer: At the origins there were several high-end developers from Rackspace, and then the idea was picked up by the developers of HP cloud services.  They really helped give impetus to development.  Since we have already moved into the "incubation period", we are attracted to the development of Mirantis.  Also involved in the project are UnitedStack and a number of developers from New Zealand.  In addition, there are people who are interested in the intricacies of clustering.  I also had some great conversations with people who are very interested in the Galera Cluster and Tungsten Replicator.  Starting from 2 time zones, in just a few months we have covered the whole world! <br><br>  <b>Question: What are the achievements of the Trove community today?</b> <br><br>  Answer: We have a service that has been running for some time at Rackspace.  We turned the DB Provisioning into a science!  We know all about the work of the MySQL service.  In addition, we have defined our role for the community as a mechanism for provisioning relational and non-relational databases.  We have done a lot in establishing relationships with companies and product promotion.  I'm interested to see what will happen to Trove six months after the release of Icehouse.  I expect to see in it such functionality as clustering, the ability to change the configuration, as well as the embedded data store Redis. <br><br>  <b>Question: What features will Trove provide in the release of OpenStack Havana?</b> <br><br>  Answer: The Trove component works with MySQL.  It provides the provisioning of instances, security groups, as well as the creation and modification of database users.  It supports resizing, and we control that the configuration and service work afterwards in normal mode.  It allows you to back up and restore.  Actually, it has everything that you would like to see in a MySQL service managed from a single instance. <br><br>  We spent a lot of time on making Trove more flexible in setting up for this iteration, and our efforts were focused on making everything necessary for integration possible.  We have eliminated a large number of accumulated technical debts, including adding the ability to integrate with RHEL and create a template configuration file.  Last but not least, we added the ability to integrate with Heat, which in the Havana release will be optional. <br><br>  <b>Question: What would you like people to know about this project?</b> <br><br>  Answer: I want people to know that we are more than just ‚ÄúMySQL as a service‚Äù.  In the Icehouse release, we are planning full clustering support for Cassandra and MongoDB, as well as MySQL clustering.  This includes master-slave replication and symmetric replication and Galera / Tungsten clustering. <br><br>  <b>Question: Are there any common misconceptions regarding Trove?</b> <br><br>  Answer: Again, I can repeat the misconception that we are simply "MySQL as a service" or "SQL as a service."  We are more than that.  We want to provide provisioning and maintenance of SQL and NoSQL data stores.  We do not want to be labeled as ‚Äúa highly specialized project‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Q: You mentioned the concept of Trove.</b>  <b>Can you tell us more about this?</b> <br><br>  Answer: Clusters.  Clusters  Clusters  The most promising development direction for Trove is that I see it becoming an API for provisioning / clustering data warehouses.  People do not want to use their own clusters.  They just want their product to work.  Trove wants to ensure easy installation, configuration and maintenance of these clusters. <br><br>  <b>Question: Who is in your target group?</b> <br><br>  Answer: I think you can guess what I will answer ... people who need clusters!  The future is data backup.  The same can be said about clustering.  Customers need their data and guarantees that they will be available when they are needed.  Clustering support will help. <br><br>  <b>Question: What are the prerequisites for launching and proper operation of the Trove at the moment (in the future)?</b> <br><br>  Answer: The most serious change in the next six months is the Heat project.  We expect that Heat will support the installation of clusters.  This can mean joining with the Heat team, and they are very good guys, so there will be no difficulties with this!  In addition, all you need is to follow the standard OpenStack requirements.  As soon as we are better integrated into DevStack, which will happen very soon, in order to start working, you only need to run DevStack and use Trove. <br><br>  <b>Question: Who would you like to see among the participants of the project Trove?</b> <br><br>  Answer: I would like to see two types of people in the project.  People passionate about data.  Those who know storage technology like Galera Cluster, or Cassandra, or some other.  And, even more importantly, people who want to control the system.  Operators have the best understanding of the system as a whole, because they need to know all its ‚Äúrunning gears‚Äù.  I had a huge amount of intellectual conversations with our engineers and operators, which allowed me to improve the product Trove. <br><br>  <b>Question: What functionality needs to be improved and tested?</b> <br><br>  Answer: I think it is necessary to improve support for the Heat component due to its novelty.  I see that Trove can do a lot with Heat in the future.  I would like to see more people testing our support for RHEL / CentOS.  The Mirantis team provides immense assistance in setting up the work of RHEL / CentOS, for which I am grateful.  I would like them to be joined by other companies, which will allow us to remain honest in supporting RHEL / CentOS. <br><br>  <b>Question: How exactly can people get started?</b> <br><br>  Answer: Funny.  We are just working to simplify the output of Trove on the operating mode.  We use a number of non-standard methods, and one of my responsibilities as a technical project manager is standardization.  We have just finished working on providing support for DevStack, and she is on the way!  This, along with other features that will soon appear in DevStack, will allow you to use Trove without any additional configuration.  But for now, you need to uncover diskimage-builder, create a disk image and unload it into Glance.  After that, everything is as simple as using our Trove instance instance provisioning client application.  In addition, some auxiliary scripts are available in the repository for integration with Trove, which I will be updating in the coming days to ensure the possibility of working with the new union with DevStack.  In a few weeks, when passions subside, it will be ridiculously easy to start working with Trove.  And if someone has any questions, we have an army of smart people and one or two robots in the # openstack-trove. <br><br>  <b>Question: Thank you very much, Michael!</b> <br><br>  Answer: Not at all! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/202626/">https://habr.com/ru/post/202626/</a></p>
