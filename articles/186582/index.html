  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The future of Russian Gentoo Linux</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, I want to share my joy with you - I was finally accepted into the Gentoo Team as a translator, and on this great occasion I decided to write how the process of joining the team takes place and what my acceptance will give to the Russian Gentoo community. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  First, you actively take part in the work of Gentoo (I translated the Handbook), someone brings your translations to the tree.  Generally, it is usually someone from the Russian-speaking developers, but in my case there were no such developers.  It turned out that all Russian developers are either developing and scoring for documentation, or they fled the year in 2006 (in my case, Smit Vermeulen = Swift did commits, not Russian at all, so Pinkbyte checked commits beforehand).  Then this ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù gets tired of working as a transmitter, and he invites you to get the right to commit yourself.  There are two different procedures - one for people like me, Staffers who have commit rights to the tree with documentation and a site, and the second one for developers (Developer) who have the right to commit a tree to ports. <br><br>  After that, you have to find yourself a mentor (the person who will help you prepare, in my case, Sven agreed to be a mentor for me), make a quiz (a set of Gentoo questions that any self-respecting Staffer should know).  Having completed the quiz, you send it to the mentor, and he begins to load you with questions, clarifications and additions (for example, I wrote how the rules should resolve issues when one developer is dissatisfied with the actions of the other, that for this is Project Lead. they asked - and if ‚Äúarguing‚Äù in different projects, what kind of lead should they ask).  You answer him, he loads you further.  Repeated n times, then the mentor says that you are ready, and gets a bug in bugzilla on you. 
      <br>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The bug is written by some person from the team that accepts new members, asks to send a quiz, which you do.  After that, by mail you agree on a convenient meeting time for both of you, and you meet, usually on IRC.  They are starting to load you again about your quiz (but after the mentor it seemed to me to be simple).  Sometimes you meet several times, sometimes one is enough.  Then they give you all sorts of rights, they prescribe you in all sorts of LDAPs and others. <br><br>  Then you, in principle, can already start making commits, but I still went to the mentor to make sure that I understand the process correctly - when you can commit, what to write in the accompanying message, and so on.  Having received the answers, I got down to business. <br><br>  Now what have I done and what awaits us: <br><br><ul><li>  Translated the whole HANDBOOK for common architectures, MIPS / ITANIUM remained and a couple more </li><li>  Gradually, I transfer the translations of the man-pages made by the Calculate Linux project (they put them in HTML, I translated them into the original form of MAN-pages, and they are gradually included in the new versions of Portage) </li><li>  I translate articles on the Gentoo Wiki (by the way, almost all the documentation except the handbook will soon be moving there, so I advise you to pay attention) </li></ul><br><br>  Why did I write all this (except for samopiara)?  Actually, I hope that someone will join the project and translate something.  If anything, send me. <br><br>  PS: <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/ru/handbook/">Russian Handbook</a> , <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Help:Translating/ru">one of the translated wiki pages</a> , a <a href="http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/%3Fp%3Dproj/portage.git%3Ba%3Dtree%3Bf%3Dman/ru%3Bh%3D105f1cdc7eecbad999df54530a472cfbaeaa6f2c%3Bhb%3DHEAD">list of translated man-pages</a> (they will automatically be available when you update portage, if the system language is set to Russian) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186582/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186582/</a></p>
