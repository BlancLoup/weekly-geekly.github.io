The study showed that people get more pleasure from circumventing losses than from making a profit (the same value).

      Imagine, for example, that you are playing eagle and tails for money, if you throw a coin and tails out, you lose $ 10.  How much would you like to get if an eagle fell? <br>  Most people answer $ 20.  That is, they want a potential reward of twice the potential loss.  In other words, we want to have a lot of money in our pockets without losing anything. <br><br><h5>  Free Trial Versions </h5><br>  The fear of loss is one of the reasons for the success of the trial strategy, which works very effectively for SAAS.  When we get something for free, we eventually get used to it and don‚Äôt want to part with it, so we‚Äôre ready to pay the money, keeping the status quo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/797/fe8/06a/797fe806aeca150e2c227d7a27686230.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Simply put, we overestimate losses and try to avoid unnecessary costs and high prices.  Booking.com benefits from this by using the ‚ÄúBlock price‚Äù points before prices ‚Äúcan‚Äù jump. <br><br><h4>  <b>Self-efficacy</b> </h4><br>  Self-efficacy is the power of faith in your own competence ‚Äî how well, in your opinion, you will cope with the task.  Self-efficacy can directly influence your motivation and your desire to complete the task. <br><br>  I will give an example, self-efficacy directly affects how you follow a diet or exercise regimen.  If you do not believe in your capabilities, then chances are high that you will give up everything. <br><br>  Thus, low self-efficacy can force people to believe that a task is more difficult than it actually is and this can prevent even starting a task. <br><br><h5>  Reward for success </h5><br>  Self-efficiency grows with success, we can give the user the appearance of this success, occasionally rewarding him for the faithfulness of the action performed, thereby increasing the probability that he will go further and complete the task.  Anything can be a reward, even a green check mark indicating the correctness of the action performed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de7/d5c/7fa/de7d5c7fa4d39bfa7d6978873f59dc67.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The reward for the success of the task in the process strengthens the belief that you can complete the task <br>  In a test published by Luke Wroblewski, a built-in form validation on a web page showed a 22 percent increase in success rates and a 31 percent increase in user satisfaction. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hlU74LIPauo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg6isKNeuiyzn2erhxC1cJw9Jizuw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Let things look simpler </h5><br>  People with low self-efficacy may not cope with the task, so breaking the process into several parts can make everything visually easier.  As you work on the process, reward them for each step in order to maintain self-efficacy as you progress. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/081/a94/e8e/081a94e8eade0abd966dfebad34a48fd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Demonstrate the success of the rest. </h5><br>  Self-efficacy can also increase due to the activity of other users.  If we see how others successfully perform the task, we also begin to believe that we can cope with the task.  You can use this to show existing customers who have already made a purchase: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad8/b1c/771/ad8b1c7712752584b5581862455e3c2f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Or the number of people already subscribed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e5/b24/f54/5e5b24f542f3b3b6a0d8c694ff81ee5f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>Dual Process Theory</b> </h4><br>  We can also benefit greatly by knowing how our brain processes information in the decision-making process. <br>  One of the most popular theories about thought is the ‚Äúdual process theory,‚Äù which says that our brain forms thoughts using two separate processes.  One of the processes is conscious, and the other is subconscious. <br>  In his book Thinking: Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman describes two systems as follows: <br>  System 1: Fast, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypical, subconscious <br>  System 2: Slow, Effortless, Infrequent, Logical, Prudent, Conscious <br>  Both systems are constantly involved and some of them make decisions for us every time.  Simply put, we either make hasty decisions or digest thoughts very scrupulously. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a8c/70f/2d3/a8c70f2d352087fdb9dac966d9f0f905.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚ÄúSystems 1 and 2 are always active when we are awake.  System 1 starts automatically, and System 2 is only partially used in standard mode.  If System 1 has problems, System 2 is connected, providing more detailed information to solve the problem at the moment.  Thus, an experienced driver can comfortably control most aspects of driving without thinking, using System 1. Quick decisions such as changing gears or choosing a course can be made automatically, even if you talk to a passenger or listen to music. <br>  When he approaches a complex intersection, system 2 is turned on, since at this moment more concentration and rationality of reasoning is required. <br><br><h4>  <b>Optimization for System 1</b> </h4><br>  According to Harvard University professor Gerald Zaltman, up to 95% of purchases we make using System 1. <br>  And we can effectively use System 1 the main thing is not to force the user to think. <br>  Visual targeting <br>  Use visual cues to literally direct attention where it‚Äôs needed.  Our attention is very easily influenced, so that even imperceptible signals can be effective. <br>  Optimizely it does "attracting" the view to the motivation for action: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/646/f24/419/646f244192dcfaeff13aad6d7df8d840.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Evernote does the same, even with more intensity, creating a silhouette of the cursor near the CTA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c54/a9f/739/c54a9f7392c595f2005af50dc98c1dec.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In Wheelofpersuasion published the results of using visual targeting to the page with the reporting form for the client of their hotel Van Der Valka.  You can see below that the usual addition to the cursor resulted in a 57 percent conversion increase! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fce/108/d0f/fce108d0f879fd63f0819dfc51f58e43.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, we don‚Äôt have to emphasize visual signs.  But this is the current method of attracting the attention of users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/383/65e/b35/38365eb359fa7aa12f5776be2b51eb4f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>Communication using images</b> </h4><br>  Since System 1 is initially emotional, we can control emotions with the help of images of real people (NOT stock photos!), And this is closely related to facial expression. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7df/8ca/c7c/7df8cac7c128932615ee80c0716b5330.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Note that in this example, the eye is first attracted to the face of the woman, and only then we pay attention to the registration form - this is another example of visual indication.  Kissmetrics has published studies of how to attract the eye and what we can learn from this. <br>  Since we unconsciously first react to a person‚Äôs face, with the help of properly selected physiognomy we can help the visitor of our site to form a positive feeling from our product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/417/8a9/9f1/4178a99f1fba58e8d2059c5c358d45a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Offer a quick reward </h5><br>  System 1 makes quick, automated decisions so that immediate rewards can play into the hands of the effect of cognitive bias.  The study, published on ContentVerve, shows a 31 percent increase in visits to the payment page by adding information about the promotion to a key. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ce/c0f/4f7/1cec0f4f7d0b49e65f9f0856d40aeab5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>Psychology of Your Customers</b> </h4><br>  The search for psychological principles when creating ideas for testing does not exclude the need for testing itself.  We are trying to help the user make a decision by acting on certain points in his mind - but not all buyers are the same. <br>  In addition, no one has not canceled the impact of simple logic and competent description of your product.  In any case, by better understanding the decision making process of our customers, we are more likely to convince them to make the decision we need. <br><br>  Translated by <a href="http://multi-landing.net/">Multi-landing</a> project staff.  We will be happy to answer all your questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242469/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242469/</a></p>
