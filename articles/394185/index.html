  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Undisturbed about the possibilities of Telegram channels</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c8/3b4/d24/6c83b4d24cb347cca2d471f3b824d3d9.jpg"><br><br>  The base of active users of Telegram over 100 million per month.  Every day, the service is replenished with another 350 thousand new users.  Most of them are in Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, India, Brazil and Italy.  Nevertheless, according to TNS Russia, Telegram with a 15% share is the fourth polarity messenger in Russia. <br><br><h4>  <b>Specifics</b> </h4><br>  In September 2015, ‚Äúchannels‚Äù appeared in the Telegram - a metamarphosis, a unique hybrid of news feed and personalized mailing, a bliss for marketers and authors.  The new feature provides the ability to send a message to multiple users (subscribers).  Channels have no restrictions on the number of participants and display the entire history of messages.  Each entry has a counter with the number of views.  Channels can be private or public.  There are no comments in them and that's great.  You do not have to spend time and respond to user discussions to maintain loyalty to the audience.

      <br>
    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The news feed we are used to is an indivisible stream of information, where any of the entries may go unnoticed.  In the channel, each message is unified.  Content is sent to a specific person and one gets the feeling that the author is speaking directly to his reader.  A subscriber can turn off notifications, but the count of unread messages will remain.  Also, the channel owner can disable notifications if, for example, it decided to record late at night. <br><br>  By the principle of any chat channels support upload files, images, music and video.  The only limitation is that the media file will be a separate message.  The exceptions are images to which you can write short annotations with no links.  But by and large, the specificity of the content in the channels has no boundaries, as there are bots in the Telegram.  For example, using <a href="https://telegram.me/markdownrobot">@markdownrobot,</a> you can format the text, the new <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/like/" class="user_link">like will</a> fix Emoji buttons under each message, which will work as a reaction to Facebook, <a href="https://telegram.me/saytotext">@saytotext</a> will turn any message into voice speech. <br><br><h4>  <b>Numbers</b> </h4><br>  Over a million channels have been created in Iran.  The largest of them belong to Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabia TV channels.  For example, this channel has 1.1 million subscribers.  Each message is typed from 100 to 400 thousand views!  About 50 such messages are published per day.  The total number of views per month is equivalent to the indicators of the largest media like Gizmodo, The Guardian, Huffingtonpost, BuzzFeed, etc. Only in contrast to these publications, there is not even a year for the channel.  Plus, there is a huge difference between potential audiences at the linguistic level - there are more than a billion English-speaking Internet users.  Feel the potential of the Telegram channel? <br><br>  Let's return to the Russian realities.  We have about 10,000 channels.  The largest of them have 10-15 thousand subscribers.  It is important that the majority of channel owners in Runet make 1-3 records per day and then not daily.  In this regard, the number of views from the total number of subscribers as a percentage is much more than that of Iranian colleagues - 60-80% versus 10-20%, respectively. <br><br>  And now I want to tell you what a channel with 2,000 subscribers is by the example of its own.  On average, 5 minutes after publication, a message is seen by 10% of subscribers, and 30% after 30 minutes.  With two thousand friends and subscribers, you will not receive such numbers either on Vkontakte (coverage 15%), or on Facebook (coverage 10%), or on Twitter (coverage 10%).  Conversion to clicks from 5 to 15%.  With a thousand views on some links listed 100-150 clicks!  Thanks to repost and an unspecified number of new visitors without a subscription, each of my messages collected from 1000 to 4000 views.  This is comparable to the number of article views from regional media. <br><br>  Most importantly, the current <a href="https://telegram.me/groks">@Groks</a> performance is the result of my work in 2 weeks!  Well, as work, 35 messages somewhere out loud on topics of interest to me.  Channels can not be searched in the application itself and they are not properly represented on the Internet.  In connection with these there is a touching situation, reminiscent of the rise of the Runet.  The time about which I read, but which I did not find.  There are local gurus, there are evangelists, there is a mutual PR, there is a classical sarafanka and the absence of the habit of measuring everything with money.  Currency - fan and subscribers. <br><br><h4>  <b>Promotion</b> </h4><br>  The concept of the channel is immanence, freedom of expression and no illusions about the context.  Together it works to attract your unique target audience.  Fasting, unlike social networks, does not require an image to attract attention.  It can be of any format: a simple note, annotation with a link or video, music, and anything. <br><br>  To promote my channel, I first talked about this on social networks.  Then added it to the <a href="http://tchannels.me/">TChannels</a> and <a href="https://botfamily.com/">BotFabily directories</a> .  Then I learned that Telegram has a number of channels that announce the appearance of new ones.  <b>The greatest result was obtained from <a href="https://telegram.me/rugram">RuGram</a></b> . <br><br>  Other Russian: <a href="https://telegram.me/channelslist">Interesting Channels</a> , <a href="https://telegram.me/bots_and_channels">Bots and Telegram channels</a> , <a href="https://telegram.me/ruschannel">Rusian Channels</a> , <a href="https://telegram.me/ChanChannels">ChanChannels</a> , <a href="https://telegram.me/listgram">ListGram</a> , <a href="https://telegram.me/tchannelsru">TChannelsRu</a> , <a href="https://telegram.me/CatalogChannels">CatalogChannels</a> , <a href="https://telegram.me/ChannelsRU">ChannelsRU</a> . <br><br>  Other international: <a href="https://telegram.me/worldchannels">WorldChannels</a> , <a href="https://telegram.me/tchannels">TChannels</a> , <a href="https://telegram.me/canalestelegram">CanalesTelegram</a> , <a href="https://telegram.me/TlgrmChannels">TlgrmChannels</a> , <a href="https://telegram.me/telist">Telist</a> , <a href="https://telegram.me/place4channels">Place4Channels</a> . <br><br>  The next step was to communicate in various group chats and with the owners of other similar channels.  After 10 days, I had 700 subscriptions.  After my channel I was suddenly mentioned by Ilya Ryabov in the compilation on <a href="http://droider.ru/post/vam_telegram_5_zanimatelnyh_kanalov_po_versii_droider-16-05-2016/">Droider.ru</a> for which <a href="http://droider.ru/post/vam_telegram_5_zanimatelnyh_kanalov_po_versii_droider-16-05-2016/">many thanks</a> to him.  This was followed by a mention on one of the largest channels of TechSpark, Andrei Sebrant, which ultimately led to today's figures. <br><br>  Finally I want to share the channels that I read myself. <br><br>  <a href="https://telegram.me/addmeto">@addmeto</a> - Grigory Bakunov, aka Bobuk, of course, about technology. <br>  <a href="https://telegram.me/techsparks">@techsparks</a> - Andrey Sebrant and amazing high-tech news. <br>  <a href="https://telegram.me/g33ks">@ g33ks</a> - from geeks to geeks! <br>  <a href="https://telegram.me/evaevt">@evaevt</a> - Valentina Evtyukhina, everything about digital marketing. <br>  <a href="https://telegram.me/brodetsky">@brodetsky</a> - Andrey Brodetsky about technology, media and society. <br>  <a href="https://telegram.me/internetanalytics">@internetanalytics</a> - Alexey Nikushin and Internet market research. <br>  <a href="https://telegram.me/bestarticles">@bestarticles</a> - Mikhail Kafanov makes entertaining selections of articles. <br>  <a href="https://telegram.me/smmrus">@smmrus</a> - news, reviews and analytics of internet marketing. <br>  <a href="https://telegram.me/abbsol">@abbsol</a> - Pavel Fedorov about the Russian language and how to write texts. <br>  <a href="https://telegram.me/beardycast">@beardycast</a> - bearded people about gadgets, science, games and movies. <br>  <a href="https://telegram.me/startupnews">@startupnews</a> - Anna Naumenko about startups and business. <br>  <a href="https://telegram.me/teleblog">@teleblog</a> - the most recent news about Telegram. <br><br>  In the appendix, a link to my <a href="https://telegram.me/groks">channel digital grokkerov</a> . <br><br>  Thank you all very much for your attention! <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394185/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394185/</a></p>
