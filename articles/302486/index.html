But if you have never released a mobile game, many things and rules can be an unpleasant surprise and greatly slow down the publishing process. </p><br><p>  This article will help novice mobile game developers to prepare for publication in the stores and find out the answers to such questions as: </p><br><ul><li>  Why not just take screenshots from the game and insert them into the description? </li><li>  Why is it worth to get acquainted with the requirements of both sites, even if at the moment the release is only for one of them? </li><li>  What can find fault with the review in the App Store and how long can it take? </li><li>  What pitfalls are waiting for the developer of free-to-play games? </li><li>  Why Windows users will suffer when publishing in the App Store? </li><li>  Why can test payments not work on iOS? <a name="habracut"></a></li></ul><br><h4>  <strong>Introduction</strong> </h4><br><p>  The other day I released my mobile game <a href="http://niceplay-games.com/games/wizard-swipe.html">Wizard Swipe</a> on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.niceplaygames.wizardswipe">Google Play</a> and the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1079843974">App Store</a> .  This is <abbr title="The first release is completely free (without ads and inap) hardcore runner Hardmode ON">my second release</abbr> in these sites, so I was already a bit prepared for publication, but still many things and rules were a surprise for me, which I would like to tell other game developers to make their lives easier. </p><br><p>  I will not talk about trivial things like rules of rules (which can be easily found in the documentation), but I will try to highlight various unobvious moments and requirements that are better known in advance, which will save a lot of time and nerves in the future. </p><br><h4>  <strong>Both requirements are important.</strong> </h4><br><p>  Even if you plan to release the game in the App Store only six months after the release on Google Play, be sure to read all the requirements and nuances of both sites in advance. </p><br><p>  Why?  Because the requirements of the store can spoil your plans for the preparation of promotional materials for this platform.  For example, you will make 8 screenshots for Google Play and will count on 8, and then find out that in the App Store the maximum number of screenshots is 5. You will have to choose which ones to get rid of.  It is better to learn about these limitations in advance and make 5 universal screenshots. </p><br><p>  Or you decided to release first in the App Store and prepared only a full description of the game.  And then we learned that Google Play has a separate section for a short description (up to 80 characters).  You will have to do additional texts, order translations, etc. Also, there is a separate section in the App Store for keywords (up to 100 characters, including separators), and there is no such field in Google Play. </p><br><p>  Another good example is the game trailer.  If you want to make a video trailer on Google Play, all you have to do is enter the URL of the video on youtube.  No restrictions, only <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/1078870">tips</a> : </p><br><blockquote>  Videos should be short (from 30 seconds to 2 minutes) and demonstrate the most attractive features of the application. </blockquote><br><p>  In the App Store, the <abbr title="In the App Store, it is called Preview.">promo video is</abbr> strictly limited in duration - from 15 to 30 seconds and should have the resolution of the device on which it plays (more on the limitations a little later).  Hence the conclusion - the video should be done according to Apple's requirements, since they are more stringent, or make 2 separate videos (which is 2 times more work). </p><br><h4>  <strong>Media materials</strong> </h4><br><h5>  <strong>Screenshots</strong> </h5><br><p>  With screenshots, not everything is as simple as it seems, especially in the App Store.  You need to remember the rule <em>"Screenshot of the game from the device ‚â† Screenshot in the store</em> . <em>"</em>  You can not just take and make 5 screenshots from the device, and then use them as screenshots for the store.  And the point here is not in the "marketing moves", but in the requirements of Google Play and the App Store. </p><br><p>  Everything is easier on Google Play, so let's start with it.  If you want your game to fully support tablets with higher resolution, you need to upload separate screenshots for 7 'and 10' screens (this is one of the conditions for displaying the inscription that your application is optimized for tablets).  Hence the logic - we make the source of the screenshot as large as possible (for example, 10 '), and, if necessary, make smaller copies of screenshots for small devices. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/796/dbd/aa4/796dbdaa4e1045c58bfd38f6830e77aa.png"><br><br><p>  With the App Store, everything is a lot more complicated.  The fact is that the screenshots for this site should have strict dimensions (for each device from Apple), as if they were made directly from this device.  At the moment, to put the game in the App Store you have to add from 1 to 5 screenshots <abbr title="Permissions specified for vertical screenshots without status bar">for each screen resolution</abbr> (actual requirements can be found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Appendices/Properties.html">on the Apple website</a> ): </p><br><ul><li>  640x1136 4-Inch Retina 9x16 </li><li>  750x1334 4.7-Inch Retina 9x16 </li><li>  1242x2208 5.5-Inch Retina 9x16 </li><li>  640x960 3.5-Inch Retina 2x3 </li><li>  1536x2048 iPad 3x4 </li><li>  2048x2732 iPad Pro 3x4 </li></ul><br><p>  It is necessary not only to make 6 different sizes, but at the same time 3 different aspect ratios (9x16, 2x3, 3x4).  That is, with a simple screenshot, you will have to do something in the editor (cut off pieces of the image or add new elements). </p><br><p>  Everyone understands the problem of different screenshots permissions in their own way.  I will tell you about the method that I applied myself.  Instead of screenshots, I used images of devices with these screenshots, a neutral background and localized captions (official sources of images of devices for the App Store are <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/">here</a> , for Google Play are <a href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/promote/device-art.html">here</a> ).  It turned out these sets of screenshots: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b83/e64/58a/b83e6458a8884976910dbc7af0bed273.png">

    <p>  This version of the screenshots for the story makes it easy to adapt the image to different aspect ratios.  For example, in my case, the background will just take up a bit more space on more ‚Äúsquare‚Äù devices and the bottom of the smartphone will be slightly more cropped: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/16c/b39/407/16cb394074ff458a8031f81101a62b8c.png"><br><br><h5>  <strong>Video clip</strong> </h5><br><p>  In Google Play, the video is set to a link to youtube.  Of the obvious drawbacks, I will say that vertical videos will be displayed with black bars on the sides, this spoils the impression of the video and does not allow watching the video on the device in an upright position.  For horizontal video I do not see any minuses.  Unless it is necessary to get the channel on youtube. </p><br><p>  In the App Store <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Appendices/Properties.html">video requirements are</a> much stricter: </p><br><ul><li>  As I wrote above, the duration of the video is limited (from 15 to 30 seconds). </li><li>  For different screen resolutions you need to download different videos (with a fixed resolution). </li><li>  Video on the App Store can only be downloaded from OS X (or virtuals) via Safari. </li><li>  Regular video in a standard format most likely will not meet the requirements of Apple (just below I will tell you how to convert your video into a format that is allowed in the App Store). </li><li>  The video in the description is not supported on old devices (3.5 'iPhone), there will only be screenshots. </li></ul><br><p>  Unlike the screenshots, the promo video on the App Store requires only 4 screen resolutions (2 aspect ratios): </p><br><ul><li>  640x1136 iPhone 9x16 </li><li>  750x1334 iPhone 9x16 </li><li>  1080x1920 iPhone 9x16 </li><li>  640x1136 iPad 3x4 </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/264/57c/6fb/26457c6fb3ce43c6ae7569f7302c141b.png"><br><br><p>  Compared to Google Play, App Store video is more convenient for users (you can watch video in native resolution and aspect ratio, there are no links to youtube), but more problematic for developers, which is why many simply don‚Äôt make a trailer for the App Store, even if He is in Google Play. </p><br><p>  If you finally decided that your game should have a video in the App Store, here‚Äôs a little instruction on how to convert your video file to a file suitable for the App Store (found the solution <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25820601/unable-to-load-app-preview-in-itunes-connect">on Stackoverflow</a> ): </p><br><ul><li>  Download the program <a href="https://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake</a> . </li><li>  We set the values ‚Äã‚Äãas in the picture below and we get the necessary file at the output. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8a/169/6a3/c8a1696a3ae942dfa0cab5a9cedb1fe0.png"><br><br><h5>  <strong>Icons and banners</strong> </h5><br><p>  The requirements for the icons in the stores are simple, but some nuances should be noted: </p><br><ul><li>  On Google Play, the size of the icon is 512x512, transparency is acceptable. </li><li> In the App Store, the size of the icon is 1024x1024, transparency is prohibited. </li></ul><br><p>  If you plan to make the same icons for both platforms, I advise you to immediately create the source of the icons in the size of 1024x1024 or more (for example, I made 2048x2048 just in case) without transparency.  When the source is ready, you can make an icon for it from Android (for example, I made slightly rounded corners with an alpha channel), you also have to reduce the file to 512x512. </p><br><p>  Icon for iOS is reduced to 1024x1024.  It is not necessary to round corners in it, since the App Store itself cuts off the corners of a square icon. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f4a/546/050/f4a546050faa4182947c5f60cadc6d6c.png"><br><br><p>  In addition to the icons on Google Play, you need to add various promotional banners (for <abbr title="From eng. Featuring when the game gets a profitable place in the counter, for example, ‚ÄúTop New Applications‚Äù">feature</abbr> ).  In the App Store, this is not required, because if you want to zachicherit, <abbr title="I'm not sure that it works 100% like that, but I heard that the procedure for such">you will</abbr> receive a <abbr title="I'm not sure that it works 100% like that, but I heard that the procedure for such">separate letter from Apple, which will indicate the requirements for the materials of the trading</abbr> . </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c39/092/34d/c3909234d12a4337a637ae88cc0fb8ff.png"><br><br><h4>  <strong>Localization</strong> </h4><br><p>  If there is a localization in your game, then it should be in the description in the stores, so that people immediately understand what to expect from the game. </p><br><p>  What is important to remember about localization: </p><br><ul><li>  If localization is, it should be of high quality (professional).  It is better to make a good description in English than in 10 languages, but through Google Translate. </li><li>  The main language in the store should always be English, so that people from countries with not very popular languages ‚Äã‚Äãdo not stumble upon, for example, a Russian description. </li><li>  If there is text in the screenshots, it will also have to be localized (immediately multiply the number of screenshots by the number of locales). </li><li>  Names of in-game purchases can also (and should) be localized.  For example, "Bag of Gold", "Gold Chest", etc. </li><li>  Texts in different languages ‚Äã‚Äãoccupy a different amount of space (and characters, which is important in the descriptions).  Therefore, a short description in German may be much longer than a short description in English (and may not fit on the requirements of Google Play in 80 characters). </li><li>  Subspecies of the same language can be very different.  For example, Portuguese and Portuguese (Brazilian) are two different languages.  Brazilians will not play Portuguese (they will prefer English), and the Portuguese will not play Brazilian Portuguese. </li></ul><br><h4>  <strong>Monetization: the price of the application and <abbr title="In-App Purchases, in-game purchases for real money">inapi</abbr></strong> </h4><br><p>  What you need to know about monetization through the stores: </p><br><ul><li>  When you register an application on Google Play, you are asked to choose the type of distribution: free or paid.  If the application is free, then it will never be paid.  There are no such restrictions in the App Store. </li><li>  Inap IDs are unique and not deleted (even if you delete a registered inap, creating a new one with the same ID will not work).  <abbr title="Thank you besteto for clarifying in the comments.">In Google Play, <strong>unique within the application</strong> , and in the App Store - within <strong>all applications of a single account</strong></abbr> . </li><li>  There are two types of inaps: Consumable (consumable, for example, buying Gold, Crystals or other consumables) and Non-Comsumable (non-consumable, for example, disabling advertising or Starter Pack, which can only be bought once). </li><li>  If you have consumable inaps, in the App Store you will most likely be asked to introduce functionality that allows you to synchronize the progress between Apple devices and restore progress after the application is removed (so that people who spend real money on something in the game won't lose it without return options). </li><li>  If in the game only non-consumable inaps, in the App Store, for a review, you may be required to make a <abbr title="Restore purchases">"Restore Purchases"</abbr> button, which, when clicked, restores all purchases. </li><li>  The feature "Restore Purchases" restores only Non-consumable purchases, Consumable purchases are not restored. </li><li>  On iOS, in-game payments (including test payments) will not work unless you have the bank details ( <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAPiOSMAS.html">this page</a> has a checklist for those who do not have inaps).  In Google Play, test payments work without specifying details. </li><li>  Get a special bank account in advance so that at any time you can start testing inapy (in the App Store). </li><li>  When registering tax data in the App Store, just skip all the fields related to the "US taxpayer", do not even touch them, otherwise the form will give an error and say that you did not fill in these fields (if you are not a US taxpayer, you are not required to fill these fields). </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f1/8da/bf4/0f18dabf4fc24221ae6c90a1d6d14b69.png"><br><br><h4>  <strong>And a few more facts.</strong> </h4><br><ul><li>  Now review in the App Store lasts about 1-2 days.  Repeated reviews can be even faster.  It used to take from 5 to 8 days. </li><li>  If you do not want the game to be released immediately after reviewing or uploading an <abbr title="Android Package">APK</abbr> , use "deferred publication" (in the App Store it is by default, and on Google Play you need to select it separately for each publication). </li><li>  Each application in Google Play and the App Store has an age rating (you will need to fill out a form that will determine it).  Consider this when developing a game (do you need some small feature or part of the plot that will increase the age rating?). </li><li>  After publishing on the site, the game most likely will not receive a single download without PR or feature.  Magic does not happen, so it is better to prepare well for the release in advance. </li><li>  You can fill the game in the App Store only with OS X or virtual machines (via <a href="">Application Loader</a> or Xcode), on Google Play it is enough to upload the APK file directly through a browser from any operating system. </li></ul><br><h4>  <strong>Conclusion</strong> </h4><br><p>  Thank you for reading!  If you have questions, ask in the comments - be sure to answer!  If you find an error or inaccuracy, write to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/conversations/dunmereyey/">me in PM</a> .
