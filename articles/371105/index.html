  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The spine of the geek, or the mattress on which we sleep, is no less important than the chair in which we work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  On Habr√©, the theme of the correct desktop and chair has been raised repeatedly.  Since we, programmers, have to sit a lot during the working day, the back sooner or later makes itself felt, and over the years it turns out to be little to take care of it only during the day.  Do you often use the phrase "good morning does not happen?"  Enough tolerating this!  My text is written for you.  The mattress on which we sleep is no less important than the chair in which we work. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mj/uq/k4/mjuqk4uumf272d4apujx3k9cog8.jpeg"></p><br><p>  When back problems arise, we go to an orthopedic surgeon, so I thought that our back suffering from sitting work just needs an orthopedic effect from a mattress. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  When I did not have an orthopedic mattress, I thought that it was an engineering facility for siphoning money from the public.  It seemed to me - the mattress is a mattress, harder - better, well, and the like: I wouldn‚Äôt creak, I wouldn‚Äôt subside.  But it turned out that everything is not so simple. </p><br><p>  Now, from the right mattress and pillow, I wanted to meet the following important criteria for me: </p><br><ol><li>  Support the spine during sleep to be able to completely relax </li><li>  To prevent anything from flowing in the dream, the blood vessels and arteries are not clamped, especially in the neck area. </li><li>  So that the mattress does not bend to the center (there was no effect as if you were lying in a hammock) </li><li>  So that I do not bounce, when on my other side of the mattress my hundred kilogram "half" flops </li><li>  To serve for a long time, did not sink and did not creak at the crucial moment </li></ol><br><p>  Immediately I will give the main advice: do not order on the Internet, you must definitely try before you buy.  Yes, go straight to the store to lie on the real mattress itself.  And better not on one!  If you hesitate - go on a weekday during working hours when there are no customers in the store.  The main thing here is not to jump up from the mattress in two minutes, you need to give yourself time to sort out your own feelings.  I found a mattress salon in Konkovo, near work.  They are allowed to lie on all the mattresses that are on sale, as long as necessary, you just need to call and sign up for a "test drive."  I think there is probably something similar next to you too. </p><br><p>  Investigating the question, I found out that there are only two types of mattresses, and each type has a different orthopedic effect that my back so much desired: <strong>mattresses with springs</strong> (with a spring block) and <strong>mattresses without springs</strong> . </p><br><h3 id="bespruzhinnye-matrasy">  Springless mattresses </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ab/hq/6b/abhq6bc7z8sgdhcckww2xvmjdym.jpeg"><br><br>  Springless mattresses are good because they will not creak - that's for sure, even at the most crucial moment.  If the springless mattress is of high quality, then inside it has quite effective fillers, usually multi-layered: from latex to coconut board for rigidity.  Although properly selected fillers and allow for good blood circulation during sleep, the device of the mattress does not exclude the "hammock effect".  In my opinion, although springless mattresses can really be very comfortable in sensations, it is their rather low orthopedic effect, because the design itself does not allow coping with ensuring proper support of the spine. </p><br><h3 id="pruzhinnye-matrasy">  Spring mattresses </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cx/rp/_7/cxrp_7ny9k7ybxcwjifpw1j-qm4.jpeg"><br><br>  Spring mattresses are also "not all equally useful" in terms of orthopedic effect. </p><br><p>  Inexpensive spring mattresses (which I was just like this) have a dependent spring block.  This is when the springs of continuous weaving are fastened together by a spiral, which is fixed by locks on the first and last turns.  In addition, each specific spring is in the form of two cones connected by vertices.  Since, due to such a construction, you lie on it, like in a hammock, and you jump when even the cat jumps onto the bed, it does not support the spine, and in general the position of the spine is quite unhealthy. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mj/xx/bs/mjxxbs9wtoa5s8xa9asb7mkvnla.jpeg">

      In addition, over time, the mattress began to creak, the springs were deformed, and he clearly sank in those places where we mostly lay.  But cheap. </p><br><p>  As a result, I stopped in my choice <strong>on a spring mattress with a block of independent springs</strong> .  There are many brands and models on the market, and it turned out to be quite difficult to figure out. </p><br><p>  It is generally believed that the orthopedic effect is steeper, the more springs there are for one berth.  But it is not so.  The role is played by the design and quality of the springs and by means of which softness is ensured - that is, the mattress filling. </p><br><p>  The design of the springs, which, in my opinion, should be taken into account when choosing a mattress is: </p><br><p>  <strong>Hourglass</strong> is a fairly budget option, but structurally not bad.  The spring has three stages of compression, when the central part is compressed last of all at the highest load.  Thus, at the expense of these several levels of rigidity at once, the mattress with such a block provides precisely the orthopedic effect of supporting the spine during sleep.  Stiffness can be adjusted by selection of fillers: a layer of latex, for example, will add softness, a layer of coconut stiffness. </p><br><p>  <strong>"MultiPocket"</strong> - in such a spring block springs of smaller diameter are used and up to 1000 springs are obtained for a double mattress.  With such a spring block, the mattress is more rigid.  Older people may not like this mattress. </p><br><p>  <strong>"4D Spring"</strong> - this spring unit is used in American mattresses.  In it, the springs are truly independent, due to which it is possible to achieve maximum orthopedic effect and provide, for example, zonal support for the spine (different levels of rigidity in different parts of the mattress). </p><br><p>  In general, the approach to the choice of a mattress with an orthopedic effect is formed as follows: </p><br><p>  High-quality backbone support should be provided with a rigid high-tech spring block of the mattress with independent springs, and the level of comfort (softness) is already regulated by various combinations of latex fillers and orthopedic foams in the upper layers of the mattress.  The orthopedic foam adjusts to the anatomy of the body, evenly distributing the weight and relieving the load, helps to relax the muscular system and correct blood circulation during sleep. </p><br><p>  And finally, in every joke there is some joke: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nd/-2/u0/nd-2u0cuctn3izeb4owqjcysolw.png"></p><br><p>  All health, sweet sleep and informed choice! </p><br><p>  UPD: In connection with the remarks made about not sufficiently deep consideration of springless mattresses, I will give the following information about this: </p><br><p>  Springless mattresses, for example, Tempur are very good, comfortable mattresses.  The average cost of a Tempur mattress is about the same as the cost of premium spring mattresses, such as Serta and King Koil, which are recognized by the leaders of the mattress industry.  Tempur has specially developed a collection of mattresses without springs, the main task of which was to MAXIMALLY bring the springless mattress closer to the orthopedic properties and sensation of spring!  The collection of mattresses is called Sensation.  In general, the warranty on springless mattresses is 15 years, whereas for spring up to 30 years.  In addition, any orthopedic foam has weight limitations for the user, and this is especially true for "active use".  Well, probably not for nothing, the best hotels use only spring mattresses. </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371105/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371105/</a></p>
