      ‚ÄúWorld Amateur Radio Day‚Äù (aka International Amateur Radio Day, Eng. World Amateur Radio Day, WARD) is an unofficial holiday that people around the world celebrate amateur radio communications every year on April 18th.  It was on this day in 1925 <s>that</s> the International Union of Amateur Radio (English International Amateur Radio Union, IARU) was created at an international conference ( <s>held April 14-25, that is, theoretically, one and a half weeks</s> ) in Paris.  The main goal of the organization was to provide feasible support for amateur radio all over the world.  Initially, the union was formed by representatives of 25 countries, but gradually grew to 160 participating countries, divided into three regions.  Region 1 includes Europe, Africa, the Middle East and North Asia.  Region 2 covers America, and Region 3 consists of Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Island States and the rest of Asia. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kh/r5/ae/khr5ae-ozfxto5ouprkh_p8odiy.jpeg"></div><br>  Interestingly, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) officially recognized the IARU as a representative of the interests of amateur radio.  So, if suddenly you,% amateur radio% someone oppresses you somewhere, know that there is <s>an</s> organization in the world where you can be helped (though, in my opinion, official documents are not entirely consistent with the same Wikipedia, radio operator -lover! = habr-radio amateur, for example). <br><br>  Remembering the events of 1925, every year on April 18 all amateur radio stations celebrate this holiday on the air.  In 2019, IARU recommends telling about the 94th anniversary with the hashtag #WorldAmateurRadioDay (and even offering <a href="http://www.iaru.org/uploads/1/3/0/7/13073366/61x91.pdf">their own</a> poster). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8n/pa/4m/8npa4mbzmc7ebyia2esvgztwxhu.jpeg"></div><br><h3>  Says VE6SH! </h3><br>  The current IARU president is Tim Ellam. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/51/fm/k-/51fmk-rfu5zi3ocjxsykelu0_vo.jpeg"></div><br>  Therefore, congratulations would be incomplete if I did not voice his words related to the 94th anniversary: <br><blockquote>  I am pleased to extend my greetings for World Amateur Radio Day.  April 18, 2009.  I love you. </blockquote><br>  In a free translation, the call sign VE6SH reports that on April 18 all the amateur radio stations of the world talk about the technical advances and research conducted by radio amateurs, how the radio unites people, and how it entertains and pleases.  Tim calls all radio amateurs to join the celebration (but not so, according to the ‚Äúancient Slavic tradition‚Äù) and at least on this day to promote amateur radio on the air and accessible social networks.  From myself I will add that Habra radio amateurs of the above activities are engaged not only on April 18, but all year round.  But since the President advises, then ... <br><br><h3>  And what have the lamps on KDPV? </h3><br>  A lamp despite the fact that every day Hams certainly notes on his own.  Someone, traditionally behind the ‚Äúmachine‚Äù (/ soldering station / debugger / mock-up after all).  I extract the lamps of God :) <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Teach you where to get the strength to stop them ...</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/no/ws/a8/nowsa8hnaldyvz2fm4jvrywjhis.jpeg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cc/bu/wa/ccbuwa10sxrrpmmrsqh0luc4m9g.jpeg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7w/8q/ik/7w8qiksvcp_jvxfnjuqgxommwja.jpeg"></div><br></div></div><br>  Now about why 6P3S, what is known for this tetrode.  Well, if only because this lamp can be assembled with the simplest transmitter, known from far childhood (and Radio magazines for the 40-50s).  A lot of schoolchildren and adolescents joined the radio business with a personalized one from the soldering of their own ‚Äúpirate radio‚Äù on 6P3S torn from some radio stations.  This lamp was one of the most powerful among the common and worked well at frequencies up to several megahertz.  Even in the most remote village, it was easy to assemble your own ‚Äú <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Albemuth">free radio Albemouth</a> ‚Äù from matches and acorns.  The only thing still needed was a home radio and a microphone ( <s>at least the handset telephone</s> ).  Although probably few people now remember this, 6P3S is used, some for audio, someone in general for induction furnaces for smelting metal. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6f/th/p-/6fthp-t8ds6hg3qcrkyyzaibkky.jpeg"></div><br>  So, I propose to mark the Day of the Radio Amateur by <a href="http://6p3s.ru/">assembling the</a> simplest single-tube transmitting console (‚Äúthe barrel organ of free radio operators‚Äù) to 63.  Circuits differ in antenna connection and modulation feed.  The coil L is wound on any frame with a diameter of 35-40 mm with a PEL or PETV wire with a diameter of 0.6-0.9 mm, the number of turns 30 + 30, counting from the grounded end.  The anode drosel DR is wound with wire PEL or Plso 0.15-0.2 mm on a frame with a diameter of 15-20 mm and a length of 8-10 cm, 4 sections of 100 turns.  Variable capacitor from any lamp receiver. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A note from pirates 6p3s.ru</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In the 6P3S console, it is desirable to power the shielding grid (pin No. 4 of the 6P3S lamp) through the ballast resistance (the resistance must be selected experimentally, so that the anode current of the lamp does not exceed 100mA).  If this is not done, it is fraught with the failure of the 6P3S radiation tetrode (since the voltage on the anode and the ecanating grid will be the same and the closed grid is closer to the cathode (than the anode), then the actual grid will play the role of the anode its area is not sufficient to dissipate sufficient power)) and a modulation choke (because the 6P3S anode current + 6P3S electric grid current + the anode current of the modulation lamp will be much more than 100mA - the classical modulation choke (output ULF transformer) of such <br>  "Will not stand"), high levels of out-of-band radiation and non-linear distortion! <br>  A sample of the power supply circuit of the 6P3S grid can be viewed in the ‚Äú3280 kHz radio station with‚Äú Super AM ‚Äùcircuit, for example, in the main unit (pre-end amplifier and modulator unit) - the first stage (2-VL1).  Capacitive isolation (HF filtering) is required! <br></div></div><br>  Among the commentators, there was a radio brother, familiar with 6P3S, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/kuza2000/" class="user_link">kuza2000</a> -&gt; <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">6P3S from kuza2000</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> Oh ... a familiar light bulb on the KDPV, 6P3S :) <br>  I was 13-14 years old, I was collecting a scheme similar to the one on the left, but the load was not the throttle, but the outline on the window.  He drove four studs into the window frame, and wound 5-10 turns around the perimeter of the window, and of course, a variable ceramic capacitor.  This was the antenna, in fact, magnetic.  In the anode circuit, there was also a modulating transformer that connected the radiols (15 W) to the output of the low-frequency amplifier.  Anode volt 300, the same at the peak added modulating transformer.  The lamp was loaded not on the whole circuit, but on a tap in several turns.  The quality of the circuit was high, and it swung to many thousands of volts.  The ceramic capacitor was getting hot. <br>  You put a plate on the radio channel, one channel - in modulation, the other - in the column.  You bring a palm to the contour, and a purple glow appears between it and the contours of the contour, and flickers to the beat of the music :) Beautiful ... the music of the music rests :))) And in the lamp, to the music, the glass, electron bombardment flickered with a faint bluish glow.  At 300 volts, the glass is still not glowing, but with modulation it is up to 600, and the electrons are already accelerating enough.  Not for nothing, beam it, this tetrode :) <br>  Then he took a small receiver on the SV range with a magnetic antenna and walked around the area, listened to his music :) At most, I left for a kilometer or two, I could not hear further :) <br>  73! <br></div></div><br>  Why is all this so important?  If only because, as history shows, many well-known experts in the field of electronics (and not only, to take the same Chris Kaspersky), were once simple radio amateurs and started from the simplest things, from the beginning.  Many of the usual things that surround us every day ‚Äî television, radio receivers, antennas ‚Äî all of this became widespread after it was proposed and tested by one of the radio amateurs.  And until now, many of these items are not outdated and serve humanity.  So, friends, today is the time to stop, look around, remember your radio achievements and ... and make some radio hack on a single transistor.  Indeed, in this troubled tribe there are no former ... <br><br>  NW TNX FER FB QSO VY 73 ES DX GL TU ES UR XYL CUAGN TU HABR DE <a href="https://www.facebook.com/steanlab">Siarhei V.

And not only regarding the equipment ( <s>the 6P3S place is already taken</s> ), but also people who could inculcate a love for radio components and the smell of rosin ... <br><br>  PPS And finally - the amateur anthem <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hymn of Amateurs (by Sergey Semenov)</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Hymn of Radio Amateurs</b> <br><br>  Since my second callsign became <br>  I can not take my passport anywhere; <br>  Don't be afraid i'm not on the espionage line <br>  but if the homeland orders it could become; <br>  Fate plays me like a bright candy wrapper <br>  Yes, I myself always desire change; <br>  I realized my dream and became a romantic <br>  and can not live without tents and antennas; <br>  And wherever I am in whatever condition <br>  I will never be lost for anything; <br>  Friends can be found in Canada and in Spain. <br>  would the wires hang over the roofs? <br>  Aether boils wirelessly <br>  the receiver itself finds the desired wave; <br>  Antennas are like pine trees on a glade <br>  Morse code will not let us sleep; <br>  And reducing all distances to zero <br>  each other will begin to talk at the end; <br>  Kamchatka, Kola and Canada and Spain <br>  and even those who are at this hour above their heads; <br><br>  <b>Chorus</b> <br>  Such a life we ‚Äã‚Äãhave such a life with us; <br>  Such a life with us, we do not need another; <br><br>  YES we are lovers, but this is the highest class, <br>  hug the planet all over with an invisible hand. <br>  YES we are lovers, but this is the highest class, <br>  hug the planet all over with an invisible hand. <br><br>  Let us be considered as eccentrics by the townsfolk <br>  none of us has long wanted to be different; <br>  We are neither poets unfortunately not writers, but <br>  if the heart dictates sochinim; <br>  The song also helps us to live and build <br>  or rather to invent; <br>  And about myself I will tell when it breaks from the thread, <br>  then the transceiver helps to survive; <br><br>  <b>Chorus</b> <br>  Such a life we ‚Äã‚Äãhave such a life with us; <br>  Such a life with us, we do not need another; <br><br>  YES we are lovers, but this is the highest class, <br>  Hug the planet all over with an invisible hand. <br>  YES we are lovers, but this is the highest class, <br>  Hug the planet all over with an invisible hand. <br></div></div><br>  Author performance: Valery R2DA and Sergey Semenov (songwriter).
