These phones will appear on sale in about a month, but so far only some journalists have seen them, and your humble servant (: And at the same time I learned answers to some popular questions about these models. More under the cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/409/387/cef/409387cef32fd2170eec6b2b4d5386b2.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first comment to the post with the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/164125/">announcement of the Sony Xperia Z</a> was quite exhaustive: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd2/be4/1c8/dd2be41c83cc2d108905d5d9ab88567c.png">

      Do not think for advertising (although this is it :), but the emotions of this user are understandable: Sony Xperia Z has released a really killer novelty: the design, the characteristics and several killer features - waterproof, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/168629/">HDR video</a> . <br><br>  Those who have been watching the evolution of Xperia models for a long time (including in this blog), also noticed that the Xperia Z has seriously increased compared to previous models, the battery capacity - up to 2330 mAh, and RAM - up to 2 GB . <br><br>  But for now there are enough quotes from the press release, let's go on the questions that were asked by the privileges who had the privilege to comment on on Habr√© and which appeared to me myself. <br><br>  <b>- How is Xperia Z different from ZL?</b> <br><br>  First and foremost: both models have absolutely identical fillings, including the same 5-inch display, 4-core processor and a 13-megapixel camera with support for photo and video in HDR. <br><br>  The Xperia Z is stylish and slim.  Its back surface is completely flat and made of glass.  Case thickness - only 7.9 millimeters.  At the same time, it is also waterproof. <br><br>  <i>The glass back cover looks great (and if this is not noticeable in the photo, then scold the photographer, not the device):</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/42d/fda/4df/42dfda4dfd0b9e2107912282e766153a.jpg"><br><br>  The Xperia ZL with the same stuffing is a bit more compact: 131.6 x 69.3 versus 139 x 71 mm.  On the eye and in the hand, this difference is noticeable.  In addition, its back surface is not flat, but slightly convex, made of soft-touch (plastic in white), and the maximum thickness is higher - 9.8 mm, due to which the phone just fits perfectly in hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d38/44a/62e/d3844a62e3275139cbae329649857ec5.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, the 5-inch screen with a FullHD resolution of 1920x1080 is the same as that of the Xperia Z. As a result, the screen occupies 75% of the surface area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe smartphone, which gives the Xperia ZL the right to be called the smallest 5 ‚Äùdisplay smartphone. <br><br>  We can say that the Xperia Z is designed for those who care about the wow effect of the phone, and the Xperia ZL is oriented towards more conservative users.  At the same time, what is important, neither one nor the other will have to sacrifice any characteristics (except waterproofness) - so just come to the salon, twist in your hands and choose what you like best. <br><br>  <b>- Why is there no wireless charging?</b> <br><br>  Because it is not needed.  Do not be indignant, just read further (: The existing wireless chargers on the market are in fact not fully wireless: anyway, there is a charging station that, in turn, is tied to an outlet. It's as if the wi-fi router was distributing the Internet, only if you put a computer on it. All convenience comes down to not picking up the phone with a charging cord each time. Sony deliberately refused to use wireless charging, because the induction coil required for it makes the case heavier and increases its size,  compensation in the standard package Xperia Z will go docking station, in which the phone is placed on the charging of just one movement. <br><br>  <i>Special contact group for connecting to the docking station:</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8bf/e4d/6de/8bfe4d6de9247051a7b49a8b11f1b359.png"><br><br>  <i>And actually the phone on it:</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f2/3cc/233/9f23cc2330f4eae760dffe1cb7ec6ac2.jpg"><br><br>  However, the option of charging through the traditional connector (almost traditional - in a special MHL-port connector for the HDMI-adapter combined with the microUSB) also remains. <br><br>  <b>- Why so little increase in battery capacity?</b> <br><br>  Compared to last year‚Äôs flagship Xperia S, battery volume on the Z and ZL increased by 35%.  Make the battery even more prevented layout requirements - otherwise the phone would become thicker and heavier.  However, milliamps are just numbers.  The most important thing is how the phone controls its energy.  For the "economic" opportunities they have the energy saving functions and the Battery STAMINA mode: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/785/fd7/a35/785fd7a351c9360865d4e3f3d340bafa.png"><br><br>  The first simply cuts off all the wireless connections in the standby mode, the second implies disabling applications that suck the Internet in the background.  At the same time, you can assign exceptions: for example, if you need a constantly working Skype, it will continue to work, but no Twitter will eat your traffic and there will be no battery. <br><br>  <b>- Why is the power button placed in the center?</b> <br><br>  There are two reasons: <i>first, it is beautiful</i> .  The design of both devices is designed in the new style of Omni Balance, which implies maximum symmetry. <br><br>  Secondly, it is convenient.  The height of the case is 13-14 cm - this is quite a lot even for large paws.  The power button lowered to the middle makes it accessible for pressing without interceptions even by the smallest palm.  And in the horizontal position it is equally convenient for both left-handers and right-handers. <br><br>  <i>Button - under the thumb:</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d8/a8e/841/9d8a8e8414ebaf5d8ffe3bb9f394535d.jpg"><br><br><h4>  What else? </h4><br>  In addition to the above-mentioned docking station for charging Xperia Z, the equipment of both smartphones will include very decent ‚Äúears‚Äù of Sony EX 300 P. <br><br>  From the pictured below <a href="">Sony DR-EX300iP,</a> they will be distinguished by the presence of a microphone: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/602/86c/097/60286c09703d23c2009266024652a377.jpg"><br><br>  - and the owners of Xperia Z and Xperia ZL will go along with the phones themselves. <br><br><h5>  Sony Xperia Z and ZL Specs </h5><br>  <b>Display:</b> 5-inch screen 1080 x 1920 Full HD Reality Display with Mobile BRAVIA Engine 2 technology <br>  <b>Processor:</b> asynchronous quad-core Snapdragon S4 Qualcomm APQ8064 frequency of 1.5 GHz <br>  <b>OS:</b> Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) with the subsequent upgrade to 4.2. <br>  <b>Memory:</b> 2 GB RAM, internal flash memory - up to 16 GB, microSD support up to 32 GB <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 13 MP with Exmor RS matrix for mobile devices, support for HDR video, Superior Auto mode and noise reduction, thanks to which it is possible to obtain crystal clear images and video in any conditions <br>  <b>Front camera:</b> 2 MP with Exmor R matrix <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 2330 mAh, Battery STAMINA mode, increasing the standby time at least 4 times <br><br>  In the sale of Sony Xperia Z will be released in late February at a suggested price of 29990 rubles.  There is no information about ZL yet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168523/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168523/</a></p>
