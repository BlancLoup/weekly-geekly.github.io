I liked the idea, apparently everything was done beautifully, but inside it was awful.  I would say that even the beta does not pull. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  First about directory synchronization.  She works tolerantly.  I have found two problems so far: <br><br>  1. You can share several directories so that they will be set up under the same name on the Live Desktop (a live desktop - HD).  It is inconvenient, although it is easily overcome by hand.

      2. An unpleasant glitch was found in Firefox: after downloading files via the hard disk drive, the old files disappear.  They are on local machines, they are visible, if you go there through IE, and in FF - only a few of the latter.  For me, this is a very serious minus. <br><br>  With Remote Desktop (remote desktop - UD) I didn‚Äôt have a friendship.  Solid glitches. <br><br>  1. The window with the DD in the browser was constantly losing focus, I had to click on it to return. <br>  It was impossible to do anything else with the mouse: neither the windows, nor the desktop - nothing responded to it as expected.  It is impossible to use it.  Perhaps the reason is the inability of the mesh to correctly work out more than one monitor - I connected to the laptop, which has (but was disconnected) outputs to an external monitor and a TV set. <br><br>  2. On the remote machine, all the settings of the screen have moved.  In particular, the taskbar disappeared - apparently, it turned out to be beyond the edge of the screen.  The reason, perhaps, all in the same several monitors. <br><br>  3. Under Vista it is impossible to open access to the UD for a simple user, not an admin.  There is no special desire to open the entrance for the admin.  In this case, under the administrator there is no possibility to include only directory synchronization, but not to allow the DD.  It turns out that under the admin I do not want to turn on the mesh, but under the user I can not. <br><br>  4. Mesh distinguishes machines by name.  Therefore, the same physical computer can appear online under different names - one, for example, defined by the administrator, and the second - by the user (for each user, the mesh is set and configured separately).  Usually the mesh does not allow remote access from the computer to itself.  But with different names, please.  From under the user connect to the admin's entrance and ... user throws out of the local session. <br><br>  Well, the last straw was that the mesh itself is written to autostart and there is no option to disable it.  Of course, I climbed into the registry, but I would like to be simpler.  I don‚Äôt really want to keep such a potential security hole constantly on. <br><br>  There is, of course, the hope that all this will be corrected for release.  But so far everything is very damp. <br><br>  Additive: after a while the old files in FF did appear.  Whether they disappear again - time will tell. <br><br>  Additive-2: I was pleasantly surprised by the unpretentiousness of the mesh.  Even on an old laptop with Celeron-750 and 256M memory, the speed of work does not bother at all.  Although the official requirements are much higher. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51852/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51852/</a></p>
