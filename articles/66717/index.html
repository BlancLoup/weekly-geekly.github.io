  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Economy links. Link economy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, in the west, the term <i>link economy is</i> becoming increasingly common.  However, nowhere is there a clear definition of what it is.  Wikipedia will not explain this to you, in RuNet, and even more so the term is not in circulation, judging by the data from search engines.  I think it's time to clarify the situation somewhat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, the term " <i>link economy</i> " can be literally translated as " <i>link economics.</i> "  It is used in the media industry, more precisely in the field of new media ( <i>new media</i> ).  Moreover, it has so far only to the economy of media on the Internet.  I think that in the future the term will spread to the offline economy of the media, when successful elements and business models from the network will be transferred there.  In addition, the term flashes in materials about online journalism, which explain how it differs from the traditional. <br><br>  The essence of link economics is as follows.  <b>Links (hyperlinks on the Internet) is a new currency of the media.</b>  Links can be exploited and monetized.  Get links - and you get an audience, show her an advertisement, get paid for it.  Content becomes a burden of expenses, by itself it does not earn money, does not bring income.  Critical to the media is getting links to your content. <br><br>  To provide links to your content, you must open it, provide tools for links to it (RSS, API, etc.).  This is contrary to the <i>economics of content</i> , which is based on controlling (limiting) access to it.  However, it is not necessary to think that these are mutually exclusive concepts.  Without content, there will be nothing to refer to, and without links, content will not receive consumption.  That is why we are seeing now successful examples of those media that, despite everything, persistently control access to their content - they charge for it.  I suppose both economies will work in the future.

      The economics of links offer great opportunities for creating added value.  It is completely legal to take someone else's content, improve its consumer properties, or, for example, improve logistics and sell.  There is no need for the initial production of content.  From here comes the rule: <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2007/02/22/new-rule-cover-what-you-do-best-link-to-the-rest/">do only what you do best, do the rest for links</a> . <br><br>  It is believed that in an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/web_2_0/31231/">economy of attention, the</a> value of a link is proportional to the amount of attention it attracts to the source to which it refers.  In this sense, the link ‚Äú <i>activity</i> ‚Äù is important.  What is the use of thousands of links, if nobody comes through them?  This nuance explains those "nonsense" that are happening in the field of citation rules.  In some countries (for example, in Estonia) the amount of citations is limited by law.  What is the reason?  Since if someone cites a paragraph even with a link, then one paragraph will be enough to understand the essence of the message being transmitted, and therefore there is no need to follow the link.  No transition - no income.  Naturally, the media are trying to legally protect their revenue base, limiting the volume of quotations. <br><br>  The economy of links seems to be more progressive than the long-known economy of content, but not all media at the time of writing this note tend to use it.  Large companies have a choice.  The Associated Press is trying to control the distribution of its products, at the same time, Reuters is already actively distributing its content and urges to refer.  Let's see how events will develop. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66717/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66717/</a></p>
