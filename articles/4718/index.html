  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Milk and eggs: smile, they buy you!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We all buy something every day.  We walk with a basket around the supermarket, put milk and eggs there (most often chicken eggs), hold a pack of cigarettes or a bottle of beer in our hands.  We have a clear plan: we will come home, we will make a wonderful omelet ... (OMG, I forgot to buy cheese!) Then we go out to the balcony, have a smoke and start our non-shopping business: watch TV, read email, play with someone something karma on Habr√© - and sleep. <br><br>  Alexander Mamut and Vladimir Potanin also go to supermarkets.  They are much more difficult than we are, because at the checkout one has to pay with a bank transfer, and in the supermarket there are owners of goods near each shop window, with whom they have to agree, and sometimes they can arrange for themselves to work.  Oligarchs operate with larger amounts and buy other products: instead of milk and eggs, they have TV channels, media companies, and interesting sites.  Taking into account the fact that there is a lot of money available, I want to talk about buying with everyone, but only what agreed to get into the basket arrives at the cash register. <br><br>  True, it remains unclear - what do they have for dinner?  We will come and make an omelet - it‚Äôs not for nothing that we bought milk with eggs (we forgot the cheese, but oh well).  We always clearly understand why we eat, so we buy what we need for this.  And a much more complicated question - why does Potterin <a href="http://www.rambler.ru/">Rambler</a> , and Mamutu <a href="http://www.championat.ru/">Champion.ru</a> ?  From what they buy, in principle, you can make a tasty dish, but when you have milk and herring on the table - the dish will eventually cause a not entirely pleasant reaction.

      My favorite habpers are the Bill Gates, Terry Camel and Sergey Brin.  Their corporations have grown over the years, starting from some promising idea.  The ‚Äúbig three‚Äù of network giants are gradually overgrown with ‚Äúmeat‚Äù in the form of services, and these services are integrated into a large organism.  This organism buys ‚Äúmilk and eggs‚Äù to give its users the next service as part of the overall development strategy.  Yahoo launches <a href="http://food.yahoo.com/">a recipe site for all sorts of delicious dishes</a> , because the Yahoo.com portal should "close" all possible needs of average Americans for information about how they live every day.  Google <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/lenta/1557/">buys iRows</a> - and the developers of this startup are now working with Sergey Brin so that Google Spreadsheets will finally have normal graphics, and network users will someday be able to store all the information on Google‚Äôs servers (though, then Sergey <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/translation/1319/">will give all this to the American special services</a> , but it is not soon).  Microsoft wants Windows Vista to become the most common and most secure OS in the world, so it sues "pirates", phishers and other bad guys, in parallel developing its own anti-virus application and very secure IE 7. <br><br>  When Vladimir Potanin <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/1350/">buys a Rambler</a> , everyone starts guessing at the coffee grounds.  No one really can explain what the ‚Äúlargest diversified media holding‚Äù is, as stated by Prof-Media representatives.  An image of a huge octopus appears before my eyes, which with one hand scrolls through <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/">the Poster</a> , the other considers the runner <a href="http://www.begun.ru/">'s</a> income, and with all the rest he apparently probes the media market in search of milk and eggs.  The octopus, by the way, has to have a gigantic head, because the media market, despite the fact that it has a common name, is in fact extremely heterogeneous: it is extremely difficult to manage a company that owns everything at once.  Before the 2008 elections, this, of course, is beneficial: everyone perfectly understands that political PR can be done with the help of Poster.  And then, after the elections, it will be possible to earn money: probably, just in a couple of years, it will turn out to work out normally within this dimensionless ‚Äúoctopus‚Äù. <br><br>  When <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/1167/">Alexander Mamut "bought" LJ</a> , no one particularly began to read tea leaves.  If we discard all those paranoid cries about the Zionist <a href="http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/">Nosik</a> , who every day sends data from ZhZhistov to Lubyanka, the concept was pretty clear: this company wants to become a leader in the web-based runet, giving users the opportunity to blog, post pictures, chat, etc. .  But the subsequent active search for ‚Äúmilk and eggs‚Äù personally caused me frank surprise, because almost all owners of ‚Äúat least something interesting‚Äù began to ‚Äúprobe‚Äù. <br><br>  During the month that has passed since the opening of the ‚ÄúSoup‚Äù website and Fitzpatrick‚Äôs ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù, only one significant news appeared on it - that <a href="http://www.sup.com/news_74.html">Champion.ru was bought</a> and its creators will continue to work in the ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù.  ‚ÄúThe acquisition of Championat.ru is the first stage in creating a pool of high-quality and popular content projects for the development of our social network,‚Äù writes Ivan Zassoursky.  And there is deja vu: for some reason, his words strongly resemble "the largest diversified media holding." <br><br>  "Soup" decided to "close" the Russian Web 2.0.  However, how to build a social network using <u>content</u> projects?  Probably worth asking about this from Ivan, although at the same time I want to learn about it from Bryn, Semel and Gates.  "Championat.ru" is not very similar to the project in the style of Web 2.0.  You can make him a social network, only fans of different teams will soon kill each other there.  And <a href="http://avstriez.livejournal.com/1389.html">add blogs</a> .  True, if we imagine that, besides the news of the editorial board, there will be readers ‚Äôarticles on the Championship. <br><br>  The most tragic thing is that Ivan cannot speak any other way.  We have to explain that the news site will become something ‚Äúsocial‚Äù, because a month ago ‚ÄúSoup‚Äù declared itself as a potential leader in the field of blogs and other ‚Äúsocial‚Äù services.  However, it is not yet very similar that the ‚ÄúSoup‚Äù will make an omelet.  Maybe still worth buying cheese? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4718/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4718/</a></p>
