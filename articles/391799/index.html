  <section class="page js-page"><h1>March Blitzkrieg VIVO</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Welcome to the pages of the blog <a href="http://www.icover.ru/">iCover</a> !  Competition, like history, does not tolerate the subjunctive mood.  And the one who dares to declare his rights to a place under the sun, coming to any competitive market, is simply obliged to offer the attention of the skeptical and sated gigahertz and megapixels to the audience something that she has never seen before.  It can be a product of excellent quality, offered at a vanishingly low price, or an intriguing legend in the style of Freedom 251, or a carefully shaped bouquet of exotic innovations or a response that has been waiting for a long time, but for some reason has not received from the current market leaders.  One way or another, but something in the new products of the coming brand should pleasantly surprise and be remembered, otherwise, no one will notice the failure and collapse of unrealized hopes. <br><br>  VIVO, which entered the smartphone market in 2011, has no reason to look for ways to attract the attention of a respectable audience.  Traditionally, almost every announcement of its new product comes as a surprise, if not in price, then in terms of the level of ‚Äútechnological special effects‚Äù proposed.  March 2016 for VIVO turned out to be extremely prolific - 2 models of the medium and premium segment with the most advanced characteristics at the time of the announcement were announced at once.  About them, and a little about the company itself, we will tell in our article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/967/9b0/9b1/9679b09b18af45d7a511f3fdcbfcbc08.jpg"><br> <i><a name="habracut"></a></i> <br>  It just so happened that lately in the mobile device market, the right to lead is increasingly being claimed by the manufacturers of the Middle Kingdom.  Confidently dispelling the myth of incompetent technical solutions, frivolous design, insignificant functionality and curved firmware, such monsters of the modern mobile market as Huawei, Meizu, Lenovo and others confidently compete, and in some areas of this endless marathon they win such unconditional market authorities like Apple and Samsung.  The titans manage to become stronger at the top of the rankings, and the attempts to change the leaders, desperately undertaken by their Chinese colleagues, are becoming more persistent and more confident.  And, if so far, albeit with difficulty, it is possible to withstand the battle in terms of functionality, build quality, materials and firmware optimization, then with regard to price, all other equal chances of a star elite for a healthy and restful sleep melt before our eyes.

      Another surprise and cause for unrest March 1, 2016 presented the Chinese company VIVO.  How she came to such a life and how she was able to surprise the priests from Cupertino and Seoul, and we will briefly tell ordinary connoisseurs of good quality smartphones below. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Vivat ‚ÄúVIVO‚Äù</font> </h2><br>  Perhaps many of us are familiar with the products of the company VVK.  BBK Electronics, one of the largest manufacturers of audio, video equipment and televisions in China, owes its birth to such award-winning brands as OnePlus, OPPO and VIVO.  Despite their bloodline, companies not only managed to declare their own and independent place in the global high-tech market, but also grew to mutual and fairly tough competition in the smartphone market.  One of the three - VIVO today at the center of our attention. <br><br>  VIVO was founded in 2009 in the Chinese town of Shenzhen.  The inspiring title, according to the authors, should be associated with the life-affirming ‚ÄúVivat‚Äù - the exclamation that was greeted by Julius Caesar in ancient Rome, far from the IT world, or ‚ÄúVital‚Äù proper, ‚ÄúLiving‚Äù, if we turn to Latin. <br><br>  Having presented its first line of smartphones in 2011, in a little over four years, the company managed to attract more than 1,600 specialists and open 4 research centers in Nanjing, Shenzhen, Dungan and Indian New Delhi.  The quality of products manufactured by the company meets the requirements of ISO9001. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ee/440/c3d/0ee440c3d4864b339e8043b0e7c8781a.jpg"><br><br>  Having gone the way of offline marketing, VIVO concentrated its main efforts on retail sales and the organization of effective advertising campaigns.  In 2015, the number of smartphones sold by VIVO reached 2 million, and in accordance with the plans for the current year, the company plans to increase this figure threefold. <br><br>  Official representative offices are now open in Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Thailand and Myanmar, but the main focus in promoting VIVO products is in the Indian market, as the fastest growing and promising market in the world.  Last year alone, the company's smartphone sales in the Indian market doubled, making up a total of 2% of the total smartphone sales sold during the year.  Despite a significant lag in sales from the absolute leaders of the smartphone market, VIVO is recognized as one of the fastest growing companies in the world in terms of its development. <br><br>  With convincing success, the company is largely indebted to the volume of investments in high-quality and effective advertising, for the production of which attracts the best professionals.  In 2015, VIVO becomes the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League for cricket, a popular game in the countries of the British Commonwealth, while shifting PepsiCo to second place.  VIVO invests millions in Hollywood companies Universal Pictures, 20th Century, the MTV music channel, makes vivid and memorable videos with stories from The Martian, The Outcast Tribe, the Minions animation tape. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8db/bf3/1a2/8dbbf31a2cb34b7c8ff96aa215d8173a.jpg"><br><br>  In countries where official VIVO offices are located, advertising of the company can be found literally on every corner and in various manifestations.  The effort and investment has paid off many times over, providing the brand with impressive growth rates. <br><br>  And, nevertheless, advertising budgets of VIVO in its market segment are far from being the biggest, and if the company‚Äôs products had nothing more than commercially-made commercials, it would sooner or later be provided with a place in the sump.  But this did not happen.  Let's touch the VIVO line and the fact that it, in fact, unites. <br><br>  All VIVO smartphones, according to the classification proposed by the company itself, can be attributed to one of three categories: <br><br>  1. Premium class.  Devices with integrated Hi-Fi equipment and top-iron, divided, in turn, into three series: Xshot - camera phones, Xplay - high-performance smartphones, X - super-slim smartphones. <br>  2. Smartphones with the ‚ÄúV‚Äù index of the middle price segment, aimed primarily at the youth market. <br>  3. Budget devices with index Y. <br><br>  It is no exaggeration to say that almost all smartphones announced by VIVO at the time of the presentation were at least one parameter, but surpassed the existing competitors at that time.  And taking into account such statistics, we can assume that this condition is mandatory in the marketing strategy of the company.  So in 2012, users got acquainted with the Vivo X1, which set an absolute record in case thickness (6.55 mm) and became the first smartphone with an HI-FI audio chip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/770/ec8/c9a/770ec8c9ae4cfc8336080bdc6ce7cbb5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For the sound quality in the model, the Cirrus Logic CS4398 DAC and the Cirrus Logic CS8422 sampling frequency converter were responsible for providing a signal-to-noise ratio of 100 dB.  However, for their $ 400 users then received a 4.7-inch screen with a resolution of 960 x 540, a MT6577T 1.2 GHz dual-core chip, 1 GB of RAM and 16 GB of ROM, a 2000 mAh battery, which, of course, even time was far from sensation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c59/af8/919/c59af891904f4ccc889be52e9f7f8e0e.jpg"><br><br>  The list of personal records of VIVO over time has replenished: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Vivo Xplay 3S - a smartphone with the world's first QHD resolution display (2560 by 1440 pixels) with a density of 515 PPI and a diagonal of 6 inches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c76/255/849/c76255849ca4511479b1dc491de4d2dc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Vivo X5 Max - another thinnest smartphone in the world at the time of release (4.75 mm); <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c9e/8ea/7a9/c9e8ea7a9d6c4dd7a17ca60bc7ce6764.jpg"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Vivo X5 Pro - the world's first smartphone with a biometric identification on the iris of the eye; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49a/152/588/49a152588a2b4ba590dc20138fd773e6.jpg"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Vivo Xplay 5 Elite - the first smartphone, with 6GB of RAM, officially introduced on March 1, 2016. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b22/047/d18/b22047d183c54a5ab737095fa566ab4a.jpg"><br><br>  According to unconfirmed rumors, VIVO is currently working on a smartphone with discrete graphics. <br><br>  A lot of users of VIVO smartphones put their firm opinion on the company's products, judging by the number of worthy reviews, thanks to the Vivo Xshot model introduced in 2014.  This strong middling still has not lost its relevance due to the diversity and completeness of the functional filling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/035/540/5ac/0355405acce94416971b9449a71da379.jpg"><br><br>  The Xshot hardware package includes: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ IPS display 5.2 ‚Ä≥ resolution of 1920 √ó 1080; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 4-core Snapdragon 801, 2.3 GHz; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Chip RAM of 2 GB and internal 16 GB plus support for microSD memory cards; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Modules supporting the standards 2G, 3G, 4G (TDD-LTE 1900/2300/2600; FDD LTE 1800/2600 MHz), Wi-Fi 802.11a / b / g / n / ac; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 13 megapixel main camera and 8 megapixel front camera, Sony IMX214 sensor, autofocus, dual LED flash, LED flash (front), ‚Ä¢ 4K / 30FPS video; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Sensors - proximity and light, accelerometer, gyroscope, electronic compass; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Audio Unit - Cirrus CS4398 DAC, TI TLV320 ADC, Maxim MAX97220 amplifier; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 2600 mAh battery. <br><br>  VIVO's branded qualities of smartphones are decent build quality and materials, stylish, instantly recognizable design (when they don‚Äôt want to copy leaders), advanced technologies, progressive Android Funtouch OS shell.  One of the ‚Äúnon-Chinese‚Äù shortcomings of many representatives of the VIVO lines still was the price until the last moment.  And here, the March announcement of a pair of flagships of the VIVO - Vivo Xplay 5 and Vivo Xplay 5 Elite became a pleasant exception to the emerging trend. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Doublet from VIVO</font> </h2><br>  A pair of Xplay series devices - Vivo Xplay 5 and Vivo Xplay 5 Elite was announced on March 1 at the company's press conference, as promised earlier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d13/123/ede/d13123ede4f7489198fe9e01042cd379.jpg"><br><br>  The older Vivo Xplay 5 Elite model has a full-metal magnesium-aluminum alloy case, rounded at the edges of a 5.43 "Super AMOLED display and Quad HD resolution, with Gorilla Glass 4 glass. The device is equipped with an advanced single-crystal Snapdragon 820, 6 GB of RAM and Hi-Fi 3.0 audio system, whose vital functions are supported by two ES9028 DACs and an OPA1612 operational amplifier. The headphone jack is a standard 3.5 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/595/c8a/b83/595c8ab837284108b3a6511f56f64e4d.jpg"><br><br>  There is no slot for memory cards as unnecessary - its shortage is more than offset by 128 GB of flash memory.  Thus, the Vivo Xplay 5 Elite was the first smartphone to pick up 6 GB of RAM on board. <br><br>  For the duration of the battery is responsible battery, with a capacity of 3600 mAh with support for fast charging algorithm.  The possibility of high-quality shooting provides 16Mp main camera with a Sony IMX298 image sensor with 6 lenses, a phase autofocus system, dual LED flash.  Front camera resolution - 8Mp. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06f/3cf/1b6/06f3cf1b6e03473193fd034016e01182.jpg"><br><br>  For completeness of sensations, the back panel of the device was equipped with a fingerprint fingerprint sensor, which allows unlocking the device in 0.4 seconds, and when the display is on, in 0.2 seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a00/351/56c/a0035156caeb4fa2bbe96984d2ed05e3.jpg"><br><br>  The pre-installed boxed version is Android 5.1 Lollipop with support for the latest release of Fountouch, which, provided quality-optimized, will allow you to fully unlock many of the features of the device.  Vivo Xplay 5 Elite is available for sale in China since March 8 this year.  The cost of the flagship is $ 655. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca8/dc2/ee4/ca8dc2ee4aa248db9c9d592f6139833e.jpg"><br><br>  In comparison with the older version, the Vivo Xplay 5 loses 2 GB in the amount of RAM - up to 4 GB, comes with a single-chip Snapdragon 652, the same battery at 3600 mAh, but less progressive audio system in the DAC CS4398 and amplifier AD45257.  The cost of the younger model, which is also on sale from March 8, is about $ 565. <br><br>  <i>Via <a href="http://shop.vivo.com.cn/xplay5/">vivo</a></i> <br><br><hr><br>  Dear readers, we are always happy to meet and wait for you on the pages of our blog.
