Especially since I have had a direct relationship with cosmic for several years now.  True, these are not ships, as in the film, but quite real flying Proton-M missiles.

I was asked to reproduce R2D2.  As close as possible to the original. <br><br>  In the living of us, no one has seen either the original or copies of fans from other countries, of which there are many, especially in the United States, and in Russia not one at that time.  Only in the film and on video clips.  By the way, the chief project engineer did not watch a single series completely.  The team accepted the idea skeptical.  But after a person was found interested in showing the robot at the Russian premiere, the goal was to make visible contours. <br></div></div><br>  In appearance, the robot seems quite simple - a barrel on wheels.  But in reality it was necessary to approach thoroughly, especially since the drawings were made, in fact, from scratch.  Yes, I will not dissemble.  On the Internet, you can find how to make this or that detail, there are several blog enthusiasts in English, even came across drawings in inches.  But the engineers said that they could do it themselves and the drawings were not important to them, they had enough quality pictures. <br><br>  We tried to accumulate all available information and got down to business. <br><br>  I collected information, communication with those who have already collected in the United States.  And, of course, further interaction with interested people.  Alexander and Sergey drew, sawed, printed on a 3D printer and collected to the final state.  Daniel was in charge of electronics and software. <br><br>  We completely abandoned the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking aluminum.  Expensive and weighty would have.  Therefore, we decided to make plywood.  But there is still something from metal.  And not lost.  Now he weighs quite a bit.  Initially, they did not plan to fit all of his "tools" into it.  Emphasis was placed on the similarity in appearance.  Further, if necessary, we will collect version 2 and we will tighten the quality. <br><br>  I know that they shower with hats.  Like, it's not robots, but animatronics.  Like this is the 70s.  So be it. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Photo 3d build and start work on the hull</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  3D model (team): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60b/ce3/66b/60bce366bdff4928867e57609b815dcb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Assembly and collection test: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/789/d5a/677/789d5a6771d74cd8bf94ea1aba9ab0ba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/461/78d/8f7/46178d8f7e3b4cffb4765997a003c198.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50e/4a0/b88/50e4a0b882044fd191f5da90374cb423.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5fa/392/973/5fa392973dfc4414a4513893e75fc296.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Painting and detailing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/779/185/5d3/7791855d3183434893c0e1d06b2be778.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5b/4cf/c08/c5b4cfc081534149986cbe24f01ee022.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Revision before stuffing with electronics: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b2/ade/891/2b2ade891bb943f79de42749e97633db.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After installing the electronics.

Of course, there are many nuances in quality, exact coincidence in details, as well as the absence of internal tools, but this will all be done later.  By the premiere of this, we did not have time to do it. <br></div></div><br><br>  <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_New_Essential_Guide_to_Droids">In addition, there are many robots in the universe, the choice of who to make next is great</a> . <br>  Only in the R series (and there are 9 of the series) there are several droids. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac0/d03/8f4/ac0d038f44bb4b1bb819a319e3375ad8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So what did we use when creating R2D2?

Only evilly smiled. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Little about us</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  We are a team of enthusiasts who make custom robots - Ruscyborg, united by common interests in the field of astronautics and robotics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a5/75b/4cd/6a575b4cdd824b588d0ccd96fb9523c9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Three of us are engineers in one of the space centers of Moscow and directly related to the production of the Proton-M launch vehicle. <br><br>  For the past 3 years, we have been engaged in ensuring that robotics in Russia is not only interesting, but also necessary, useful.  We also participated in the open source project Inmoov and were the first to make legs.  But out of the project out.
