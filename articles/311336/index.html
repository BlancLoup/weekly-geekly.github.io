There is no magic in it.  This is all <b>pure marketing.</b> <br><br>  Khaleesi is a kind of expert lead generation.  Behind her is constantly lined up a line of people willing to join, help, support.  Her success story is a bottomless source of ideas and inspiration.  Let me dwell on some of them: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. Find your dragon factor </h3><br>  What makes your business different? <br><br>  The presence of dragons, of course, sounds very cool (and already, in fact, it does not matter in what industry you operate). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

        <script>

        </script>
      <br>
    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://righthello.com/niekasowac/got-lead-generation/got-lead-generation-1.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  But if dragons are too expensive for you, focus on what your business does better or differently, and make your own DRAGON-factor out of it.  This may be a unique product or technology used, an awesome design, highly qualified specialists, customer service, etc. <br><br>  <b>Having defined your DRAGON-factor - make it visible to others</b> : tempting for potential customers and frightening for competitors.  The unique DRAGON-factor will help your business to stand out from the gray mass in the market, provide an influx of leads, and facilitate contact with potential customers from the outside. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  2. Do not sit still </h3><br>  If you can't get an army of leads at home, nothing stops you from trying to do it somewhere else. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://righthello.com/niekasowac/got-lead-generation/got-lead-generation-2.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  Do not constrain your capabilities by generating leads exclusively locally.  If you can sell your product / service abroad, start generating leads in other countries.  Remember, if not you, your competitors will take advantage of this opportunity.  And your business will not benefit from this, to put it mildly. <br><br>  Thanks to the Internet, there are almost no borders for business today.  There are many ways to attract customers from other countries.  And do not need to have a thousand ships.  Enough to get a laptop and access to the Internet to conquer the world of digital technology. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  3. Personalize communication </h3><br>  To be heard - you need trust.  And you will not achieve it by common phrases or by behaving like a stranger. <br><br>  Try to speak the same language with your target audience, adapt to their style of communication.  Get to know them better.  Find an opportunity to talk directly with your potential customers.  Learn their style of speech in detail, all the features and nature of the language. <br><br>  Use facts that are known about your potential buyers.  Express your understanding - for each individual. <br><br>  Learn from the pros: Daenerys turned the Dothraki into their supporters by giving them the strength and faith in themselves, paying tribute to each of them. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://righthello.com/niekasowac/got-lead-generation/got-lead-generation-3.gif" alt="image"></div><br><br><hr><br><h3>  4. Take care of your leads. </h3><br>  You need to understand <i>what</i> hurts your potential customers - their problems, challenges, needs, goals, dreams.  To do this, be active online (in social media, online support, on Quora and Reddit) and talk to your audience. <br><br>  Explore and create a clear view of your customers.  Then offer them what they need. <br><br>  In the case of Daenerys, slavery and danger were the main pain points of its target audience.  Daenerys showed her concern by freeing herself from slavery and protecting her followers (well, at least she tried very hard). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://righthello.com/niekasowac/got-lead-generation/got-lead-generation-4.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  Your product / service is the main painkiller for your potential buyers.  But this does not mean that you should remain indifferent to all other problems of your target audience.  Help them solve their minor problems for free: offer your advice, share your experience. <br><br>  And remember - people love when they are approached in a special way.  Such an approach is sure to justify itself. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://righthello.com/niekasowac/got-lead-generation/got-lead-generation-5.gif" alt="image"></div><br><br><hr><br><h3>  5. Stay yourself </h3><br>  With such a huge number of companies and startups nowadays, it‚Äôs easy to lose your own look.  Do not let this happen to you.  Authenticity makes your story true and helps build a special connection between you and potential customers. <br><br>  Be honest with your audience, do not be shy about who you are, remember how you started. <br><br>  Accept your failures (if any).  In business (as in life) everything can not be brilliant and glamorous.  Errors are part of the process.  No need to be shy or try to hide them. <br><br>  Do your business with enthusiasm and confidence.  If you truly believe what you are doing, others will follow you. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://righthello.com/niekasowac/got-lead-generation/got-lead-generation-6.gif" alt="image"></div><br><br><hr><br><h3>  6. Everything has its time </h3><br>  It is always better to conduct lead generation campaigns during periods when the need for your product / service is especially great. <br><br>  Your efforts may be useless (and money is thrown to the wind) if you do not understand the buying mood of the audience and in vain try to sell them something they don‚Äôt need at the moment. <br><br>  So do not be lazy to explore the market, and try to predict the need for your product / service.  Ice cream is better to offer when it's hot on the street, a gym membership is after the grandmother‚Äôs holidays, and the dragons will fly away when terrifying zombies are close and only the fire of the dragons can stop them. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://righthello.com/niekasowac/got-lead-generation/got-lead-generation-7.gif" alt="image"></div><br><br><hr><br><h3>  7. 'Fake it till you make it' (sounds less poetic in translation - 'act as if what you are aiming for has already happened' ... or something like that) </h3><br>  The sooner you start generating leads for your business, the better.  Feel not ready yet?  Most likely you will never be fully prepared. <br><br>  Daenerys began assembling an army long before her dragons became big and strong.  And you can do the same. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://righthello.com/niekasowac/got-lead-generation/got-lead-generation-8.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  Develop a prototype / demo / mocap (depending on what you are selling) and show it to potential buyers as soon as possible.  So you can confirm your idea, collect comments and suggestions from the first users and ... get potential customers! <br><br><hr><br><h3>  8. Two heads are better than one. </h3><br>  Even Khaleesi cannot get the Iron Throne without the wisdom of his advisers.  Surround yourself with people whose knowledge, competence and other talents will help you achieve your goals. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://righthello.com/niekasowac/got-lead-generation/got-lead-generation-9.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  To adjust the process of lead generation, you can also use the services of companies specializing in this.  Or, purchase solutions for automating certain processes: contact search, email distribution, etc. <br><br>  I hope the example of Daenerys will inspire you to new achievements! <br><br><hr><br>  I originally posted this article in English <a href="http://righthello.com/got-lead-generation/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr">right here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311336/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311336/</a></p>
