  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Results of the year in the mobile applications market: facts and conclusions from the report from Distimo</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In mid-December, Distimo published its 2013 report on the mobile application market.  This report, which has already become traditional, reflects the main trends in the industry over the past year. <br><br>  The <a href="http://kamagames.com/">KamaGames</a> team, communicating with the developers as part of the publishing program, noticed that developers often ignore such reports, do not study them and do not understand the current situation in the mobile gaming market.  And to make a ‚Äúearning‚Äù game without having all the necessary information is simply impossible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/abb/9ac/17c/abb9ac17c3150f5f3d0e40bfecc98d35.jpg"><br>  <i>Androids are patiently waiting for their chance ...</i>

      We decided to devote our latest article on Habr√© this year to the analysis of this report.  Find the document itself in full, you can link <a href="http://www.distimo.com/publications">http://www.distimo.com/publications</a> .  We, in turn, turn our attention to the most interesting, in our opinion, facts. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  1. Ten countries with the largest revenue from sales of mobile applications - Russia is detected! </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c1/682/7ab/6c16827ab79c0617e0751cc5f1d40804.png"><br>  <i>The top ten countries with the largest app revenue on the App Store and Google Play based on data from January to November 2013</i> <br><br>  The leaders in the past year were the United States, Japan and South Korea.  In the App Store (iPad + iPhone) the top three countries with the highest income are as follows: USA, Japan, UK.  In Google Play - Japan, South Korea and the United States. <br><br>  But, probably, one of the most important events of 2013 is that <b>in October, Japan overtook the United States in terms of revenue from mobile stores</b> .  A year ago, the Japanese were spending on mobile content by 40 percent less than Americans, but in October 2013, Japanese users spent 10 percent more on applications for smartphones and tablets than Americans. <br><br>  It will be extremely interesting to see the updated list of the most ‚Äúearning‚Äù countries in the mobile apps industry next year.  We in the company have already made a bet about this, and someone in the new year is guaranteed to receive several boxes of hot pizza as a prize. <br><br><h5>  2. Revenue sharing by country and platform - Korean and Japanese Google Play ‚Äúpies‚Äù </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84e/753/b05/84e753b055f3da8d9cb6be83fc797473.png"><br>  <i>Sharing revenue from apps on the App Store and Google Play by country and platform based on data from June to November 2013</i> <br><br>  We would like to draw your attention to two points: <br><br>  1) South Korea, along with Japan, is the leader in revenue on Google Play, while it is not even in the first ten (!) Positions in revenue on the App Store.  Country victorious Android! <br><br>  2) Through Google Play in China, you can not distribute paid applications or applications with internal purchases.  Therefore, only the App Store revenue is shown on the chart.  The country of victorious communism ?! <br><br><h5>  3. Growth of the mobile apps market - Russia in the TOP-4 </h5><br><br>  The graph below shows revenue growth for 2013 in each of the ten countries with the largest revenue from application sales. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6a/8bb/dec/e6a8bbdecba09da729ff259d113944f3.png"><br>  <i>Growth in revenue from apps on the App Store and Google Play based on data from January to November 2013</i> <br><br>  The markets of South Korea, Japan and China are still growing at a tremendous pace.  <b>The Russian market last year grew by as much as 125 percent</b> .  Will our country be able to maintain this momentum next year?  We believe that yes can! <br><br><h5>  4. The size of the profits from sales in the App Store and Google Play - a game of catch-up </h5><br><br>  Total revenues of the two largest mobile app stores for the six months increased by 24 percent.  Over the past 6 months, App Store revenues increased by 12 percent, while Google Play revenues increased by 51 percent over this period.  Google Play, as in 2012, was ahead of the Cupertino competitors in this indicator, but in absolute terms they still lose.  Not quality, so quantity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/85f/22f/cb9/85f22fcb98be28cff1c205cdb9b8355e.png"><br>  <i>The division of revenue from applications between the App Store and Google Play based on data from January to November 2013</i> <br><br>  If in June 2013, the ratio of App Store and Google Play revenues was 70/30 percent, in November 2013, these figures were 63/37.  Google strives to overtake Apple not only in terms of the number of Google devices, but also in terms of revenue.  If the trend continues, then after a year the leader may change. <br><br>  <b>On a typical November day in 2013, the global income from the top 200 applications on the Top Grossing App Store charts was 18 million, on Google Play - 12 million</b> . <br><br><h5>  5. Business models - total free-to-play </h5><br><br>  A very important schedule if you are thinking of starting to develop a game. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/afa/676/735/afa6767359e1d0ebfe61e8d8b56a587c.png"><br>  <i>The division of revenue from applications between the App Store and Google Play, depending on the business model based on data from January to November 2013</i> <br><br>  The graph displays revenue sharing by business model among the 200 most ‚Äúearning‚Äù apps in all countries.  Only one conclusion can be made from this: ‚Äúif you want to make money, do not make paid games‚Äù. <br><br>  No need to be offended and make a surprised face when the publisher did not talk to you about your paid $ 0.99 game that can be completed in half an hour without a single internal payment. <br><br>  <b>In Top Grossing there is only one paid game.</b>  <b>This is Minecra</b> ft.  And this is an exception to the rules, which can only be understood after having learned the whole history of the legendary project. <br><br>  Revenues in the top-most money categories of Games and Social Networking are generated by free applications with internal purchases.  And if you take the App Store as a whole, then about 63 percent of the revenue is earned in the Games category. <br><br>  The graph below reflects the TOP-10 categories in terms of income in November 2013 in descending order. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aed/622/a1f/aed622a1f43426be86c696034a8cf40d.png"><br><br>  And finally, interesting information for consideration: <br><br>  <b>None of the games released in the App Store in 2013, could not get into the list of the 10 most "earning" games in 2013</b> .  It is interesting to hear your opinion, why it happened.  Couldn't everyone have forgotten how to make good games all at once?  By the way, there are four such games on Google Play. <br><br>  Holiday greetings! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207402/">https://habr.com/ru/post/207402/</a></p>
