Research probes fly to the stars, huge ships travel through space, people communicate directly with computers, search for brothers in mind and create them themselves, colonies of earthlings on distant planets thrive, and robots free humans from the tiresome routine. <br><br>  But the current vector of human development is directed in the other direction.  Sometimes it seems that mankind seeks only to increase the comfort of its existence, shutting itself up in its small world, and politicians think only about maintaining their power.  Is it possible to change this vector, and how to do it? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/544/7e9/526/5447e952630b4375b9f74021e2ccf428.jpg" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's start with the fact that in striving for comfort there is nothing shameful.  Thanks to this aspiration, resulting from the instinctive needs of mankind, many wonderful things were created, and technical progress was born, precisely as a means of achieving comfort.  However, because of this same striving - interesting directions of progress often fade away, are replaced by others, aimed at satisfying the simplest needs of people. <br><br>  But people have other instincts and needs.  Among them, the most useful is curiosity, pushing people to understand the world around us and, in fact, to the processes that we all need.  For the sake of mere curiosity, many people are able to even give up partially or completely from a comfortable existence in a small cozy world.  It is enough to send people a little, to offer and show them the right path for them to follow.  But, of course, the desire for comfort should not be suppressed too much, otherwise people will simply give up on such a path, sooner or later, especially if dictated by ‚Äúhard hand‚Äù. <br><br>  Many are falling into depression, seeing only "mass" in humanity.  Someone comes up with non-viable concepts of the "ideal person", creative, but not demanding.  Someone thinks that everything can be solved by violence, direct or indirect, in order to force the majority to follow their vision of the path of progress.  Someone just plunges into decadence, disappointed in everything.  And almost everyone sees their enemies in the economy, diverting the strength and means of society for the wrong purpose. <br><br>  It should be understood that the capitalist economy is a logical and simple concept that allows people to work and live together.  Its roots are lost in the distant past, when one of our ancestors realized that he could not just take a beautiful shiny pebble found by his neighbor on a distant river bank - trite because there are much more large and heavy stones around (and not so beautiful) that You can get for it on the head.  It is necessary to exchange for something, say a bunch of bananas mined on a high palm tree, which was quite difficult to climb on ... This is how barter in kind, after thousands of years, transformed into trade, laid the foundation of the economy and capitalism as such. <br><br>  No one invented all these stocks, exchanges and currencies as ‚Äúthings in themselves,‚Äù they were just a continuation of the development of this exchange.  Shareholding, for example, arose when it became clear that the efforts of one person are not enough for the implementation of many projects, as a mechanism for the fair distribution of participation in joint venture profits.  And so on. <br><br>  Of course, there are many flaws in them, the very concept of capitalism often spreads in attempts to create a more just and social environment.  But the basic concept remains the same - the economy is based on money, people work for it, spending it on their needs and demands, and when they become quite a lot - and on more interesting projects.  In other words, those who own big enough money can direct the actions of other people to interesting projects. <br><br>  The logical conclusion is that you need to get a lot of money as quickly as possible.  But there are so many restrictions on this path.  Fortunately, thanks to the aforementioned actions and other mechanisms of a market economy - this money does not necessarily have to be owned by one person, a group of well-to-do people is quite capable of pooling their means and efforts for the desired goal.  Or even simply act alone, pushing and agitating others.  But such a group should be very numerous. <br><br>  That is, we ourselves must become entrepreneurs, capitalists, well-mastered mechanisms of the economy and the market.  Such a prospect is frightening some, but it should be understood that negative characteristics are often imposed on us by propaganda.  Others fear action and activity implied for anyone who decides to do business.  In the post-Soviet space, it is one of the most powerful factors imposed by the Soviet education system, aimed at suppressing personal initiative and lack of training for social and economic interaction of people with each other (which, by the way, gives higher chances to those who managed to overcome these imposed complexes). <br><br>  Many of us are introverts who believe that doing business is not for them (‚Äúshopkeepers vs intelligentsia‚Äù).  But thanks to the ability to deeply analyze and modern means of communication and access to knowledge - introversion becomes not a brake, but a plus.  Be interested, read, ask others, learn, share experiences with family and friends.  There is nothing difficult in this, many entrepreneurs have such a low IQ that even speaking is inconvenient.  Written and unwritten (corruption, yes) rules for entrepreneurs are therefore quite simple, although numerous.  But it is enough to appear desire and all this can be mastered. <br><br>  Some believe that it is necessary to first come up with something unique, but after that - they will take up business, occupying empty niches.  This is a very common misconception.  It is easier and easier to start in areas where there is a lot of competition - trite because it means there are a large number of consumers and potential customers.  It also means the availability of a large number of educational materials on this topic.  Well and, of course, the best way to learn gradually, starting with the basics (from the same retail, for example) and small victories that encourage continuation. <br><br>  Our goal is quite simple - to create a certain percentage of people who can not only provide for themselves, but also have a good command of economic instruments.  It is active people who determine the development of human society.  It is they who can direct humanity, and not dictate their will (the latter generally faces many unpleasant consequences, even Luddism - the need to freely make choices in a person can be much stronger than the need for comfort!).  Be active to unite at the right moment on the way to your desired goal. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395495/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395495/</a></p>
