And now I will tell you about my trip to one of the most famous conferences dedicated to information security, namely CONFidence, which this year traditionally took place in the Polish city of Krakow and collected a large number of specialists from all over the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4b5/52f/c75/4b552fc75ea5c45f840171acad3a6bae.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The guys from our company more than once successfully got to the event, passing the selection of reports, and even <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/dsec/blog/145872/">shared</a> their impressions of the trip on the pages of Habr.  This year, my report ‚ÄúBreaking, Forensicating and Anti-Forensicating SAP Portal and J2EE Engine‚Äù was reviewed by the selection committee, and I received an invitation to speak with him at the conference. <br><br>  In addition to me at CONFidence there were several other guys from Russia: Nikita Tarakanov with ‚ÄúExploiting Hardcore Pool Corruptions in Microsoft Windows Kernel‚Äù, Arseny Reutov with ‚ÄúPHP Object Injection Revisited‚Äù and Yuri Chemerkin with ‚ÄúInsecurities in Blackberry‚Äù.  It‚Äôs very cool that every year the Russian speakers at conferences on information security are becoming more and more.

      First of all, I would like to note the incredible concern of the conference organizers about the speakers.  During my visit to Poland, I have never had any problems with transportation, lunch, accommodation, or pastime.  Everything was prepared in advance by the sweetest Polish guys, for which many thanks to them. <br><br>  I flew to Krakow closer to midnight, but I was immediately greeted and sent to dinner to mark the opening of the event, which brought together organizers and speakers of this year. <br><br>  Oh, this is Polish hospitality.  Like all international gatherings, it ended with everyone teaching each other the peculiarities of national languages ‚Äã‚Äã(especially everyone was interested in various obscene words :)) <br><br>  Of course, there were also some controversies and discussions on topics related to infobase.  I returned to the hotel with a great mood, a clear understanding of what a wonderful place I got, and immediately fell asleep. <br><br>  The conference itself was held in the suburbs of Krakow on the territory of the WWII water treatment plant.  For the convenience of visitors, shuttles were organized that took the participants to the venue of the event.  It is worth noting that such an unusual place favorably differs from the classical halls of the congress centers by its entourage and the opportunity to enjoy the view.  BBQ and sausages were prepared on the street, beer and tea were poured, they played football and were actively talking about something. <br><br>  The interiors were also full of people.  Someone opened locks for speed with the help of master keys, someone hacked classic PBX, someone played Guitar Hero MK.  However, most people rushed to 2 tracks where lectures were given. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bde/1ea/03c/bde1ea03c9ec9cc9aa01b1e2283ca113.png"><br><br>  I see no point in talking about all the reports, because  All material is already available on <a href="http://2013.confidence.org.pl/materials">the conference site</a> , except for the following comrades: Adam Abrocki (Crashdumps: 0-days and Rootkits), Felix ‚ÄúFX‚Äù Lindner (Cisco in the Sky with Diamonds), Mateusz ‚Äúj00ru‚Äù Jurczyk (Beyond MOV ADD XOR - The Unusual and Unexpected in x86), Sergey Bratus (ELF Eccentricities, ABI and Architecture Metadata). <br><br>  As in any conference, it is not so much the reports that bring pleasure, but the conversations after them.  The possibility of direct communication with the speakers is what many people come to at CONFidence.  Meetings with like-minded people fill with new ideas that you can not wait to implement. <br><br>  An indescribable feeling of delight arises when you realize the great results that researchers in different fields achieve.  After that, I want to quickly get to the computer and start doing, doing, doing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f51/b1b/b48/f51b1bb48a445d1fe7433dc789742a67.png"><br><br>  In addition to the interesting educational part, an entertainment program has been implemented at CONFidence.  I have already mentioned a bunch of consoles, football and kebabs with BBQ. <br><br>  Many interesting contests also took place: for example, those who wanted were handcuffed, after which they were given 5 minutes to get out of them with the help of a master key. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c3c/d9a/d53/c3cd9ad53d60d7007662d7cb3880fe53.png"><br><br>  But the now traditional quest X-traction point, the participants of which needed to free the hostages, making their way into an abandoned bunker through various kinds of alarms.  Viewers could watch the action using live stream with cameras attached to the participants.  It was all incredibly cool and fun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cbd/586/7bd/cbd5867bda6cf608c4a10b34220c69f7.png"><br><br>  Summarizing what has been written, it can be said that such events as CONFidence belong to the category of obligatory visits.  If you are not indifferent to everything related to information security, you will definitely find such an event useful.  If you have any kind of credit, do not hesitate to send it as an application for a speech.  Russian hackers are loved and respected, and the Russian IT community is genuinely interested in foreigners.  Why are there a community, Russian interesting as a nation.  It was very fun to listen to how foreigners talk about unusual kvass drink or about someone‚Äôs incredible experience of traveling in our second-class carriages in the intervals between conversations about various techniques of attacks on computer systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/393/ecb/e91/393ecbe916a8b12900706ab6489b0fdd.png"><br><br>  Perhaps the post came out slightly emotional.  However, this was the only way to try to convey the atmosphere created by the organizers of CONFidence 2013. <br>  Miracles <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/324/a4f/78e/324a4f78ed3d9e651f7fcedf8d4ecc7c.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182764/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182764/</a></p>
