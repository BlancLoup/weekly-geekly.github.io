"Network Basics".  "The value of Cisco in data centers."  Eddie Martin  December 2012 </h4><br>  So, consider the value of Cisco for data centers.  What do your customers think about data centers? <br><br>  They find them difficult.  Before all these innovations appeared they were much simpler. <br>  Virtualization and everything else.  Only stupid did not invest money in it.  There are great opportunities for saving money, and the one who invested funds here would never have been the loser.  And Cisco has focused its attention on data centers for a long time.  Data centers were what they call "low-hanging fruit."  But the low-hanging fruit was torn off.  But now it has allowed the business to be more adaptable.  This allowed customers to deploy applications that previously took weeks, in just a few days or even less.  This allowed businesses to quickly enter the market with new proposals, which is extremely important for industry leaders, and is extremely critical today. <br><br>  Remember how several years ago Coca-Cola released a new product - New Coke?  For a long time, the company bore the idea to move away from its original formula.  Has entered the market with a new product that has failed more than any other.  This product no one loved, no one wanted.  How much time did it take for Coke to realize that this product failed?  Several months!  Could they survive in today's world at such a speed?  How fast would it happen now if Coca-Cola used networking technology?  They would have learned about it incredibly quickly, at least thanks to Twitter!  You have a Twitter account, you drank a bottle of Koki, and everyone saw it! <br><br>  A business needs to adapt quickly, and virtualization helps save a lot of money, perhaps one-time, but it's a lot of money.  It saves time and money for the "promotion" of the product.  Having invested money once, you can save money permanently in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4a/vk/a3/4avka3daglnruxxhd9y-p6u-ica.jpeg"><br><br>  And finally, the next property is Cloud.  What is a Cloud?  You answer: "It depends on what kind of cloud"!  Well, this is a good point.  So, for the client, cloud technology using virtualization in the data center means the ability to create your own cloud for data storage.  Or the ability to move your data and applications to the public Cloud. <br><br>  Here the possibility of hybridization of cloud technology arises, that is, the client can use both his own and the public Cloud.  Applications speed up my business, applications ‚Äúlive‚Äù in a data center - according to customers, these are two more important properties of data centers.  How important is it? <br><br>  Remember, I told you how I came to California and saw the MDS 9500 switch for the first time there?  Then I realized the importance of this for applications, became more enlightened.  I flew to Chicago from San Jose on Friday, and there I began to search for the next flight back home to Rowley.  I got hungry for death because I wasn‚Äôt fed on the plane, and I was ready to eat even a bag from my laptop.  I don't like eating at McDonalds, but I was forced to buy a cheeseburger from them.  I wanted to fly out early because my wife doesn‚Äôt like it when I amn‚Äôt home. <br><br>  I sat down to eat before departure.  A guy sat next to me, he was wearing shoes, and they were worth more than my entire home wardrobe, they just shone, and he was wearing an expensive suit.  In his hands he had the exact same package from Mac Donalds as I had.  I told him that I would never eat it if I were not so hungry.  We talked, he was from St. Louis, and when he asked what I was doing, I replied that I was working as a Cisco network engineer.  He said they use a lot of our equipment. <br><br>  I thanked him for it, I always say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to customers for buying our products, I started doing things as soon as I became an engineer.  This is part of the business etiquette, and people enjoy it.  This guy told me that he works for Keebler, the largest manufacturer of cookies and crackers.  I really like their cookies, and I told him thanks for that and asked who he was in the company.  It turned out that this guy was their CIO, IT director, and I understood where his money came from for such expensive shoes.  Then I told him that I was working on switches and routers and was just returning from San Jose, told me about the new product, and how I was amazed at the equipment, applications and prospects for data centers in general, trying to interest him.  I told him about the unique features of this.  He replied that data processing is indeed very important for their activities, and if the company suddenly lost data, they would immediately have lost their jobs.  He said that if they lost access to information in the data center for at least 5 days, they would simply lose their business. <br><br>  That is why data centers are so important for companies.  They can do nothing without these centers, it is the soul, the heart, the lungs of their business!  Take away their data, and they will not be able to use computers, smartphones, will not be able to invoice, receive money, will not be able to sell products - they will not be able to do anything without a data center! <br><br>  You need to be aware of how important it is for customers to be able to use applications that run all business processes.  If I tell a friend: "Mac, you can no longer use e-mail and other applications and must send all your letters by regular mail."  He will answer: ‚ÄúThen I close my business and go to retire or do something else, I can‚Äôt compete here‚Äù! <br><br>  Now let's look at what data centers are for Cisco.  The first is a platform for innovation.  This is an opportunity for self-improvement company.  We do this because innovation is new money.  For example, Nexus switches are new money, a new ‚Äúball‚Äù with a few billion dollars, and data centers were the only chance to earn it.  Nexus replaced Catalyst, they will be replaced by the next generation equipment and so on.  We produce crazy servers, which have become the goods of wide demand, we introduce virtualization there, then Clouds, never to remain without work.  Tomorrow we will talk about collaboration and IP telephony, we purchased Nortel and Avaya for this and implemented the same there.  We also acquired Celsius to develop our solution. Communications Manager, Nortel wanted to buy them back, and what were they going to do with it?  Throw away!  Just get rid of competitors, as they posed a threat.  We bought them, and yes, they became a threat, but which had no effect on Cisco, in the end, everyone got their profits. <br><br>  Next come the products and solutions.  Cisco is investing them in the data center virtualization process.  These are chassis, fiber-optic cable inside Ethernet - all our innovations, which have not yet become standard or have already become, are used in the construction of data center architectures.  In the implementation of various projects, when several data centers look, thanks to virtualization, as one. <br><br>  The third point is the partnership.  We have created good partnerships, but we have lost many, because other companies have destroyed them, such as HP and IBM.  Now we have established a strong partnership with EMC, VMware, Microsoft, ASP, Oracle, for each of the various solutions made by these companies, we have found a scope. <br><br>  Cisco wants to be needed by customers, so it pays attention to important things for them, business applications.  That's all I wanted to tell you about it.  Oh yes, I forgot to add one more important thing, service and support. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/95/p0/dn/95p0dnuw6jio3rhp4khohkfvac0.jpeg"><br><br>  Through partnership, we create world-class projects.  An example is a data center in Texas, a work of art: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1Nt1z5uM44" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  How many of our products are delivered through partners?  80-90%.  And we appreciate them for it and do not want them to go crazy with us. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kibR2oi-Bpc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Continued:</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/351220/">FastTrack Training.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/351220/">"Network Basics".</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/351220/">"The Basics of Telephony."</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/351220/">Part 1.
