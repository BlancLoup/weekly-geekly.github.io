My article will be devoted to Sudha Murthy, the first Indian female programmer who is best known for her charitable and literary activities.  Peer into her harsh eyes and imagine what a difficult path this outstanding woman went through, breaking through all the gender prejudices. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25d/7ba/10d/25d7ba10d717448eaa163d638e483030.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Early years and education </h3><br>  Padma Sri Sudha Kulkarni Murthy was born in a poor provincial family: her father worked as a surgeon, her mother was a housewife.  The family lived poorly, but all the money went to the books, of which there were many in the house.  Her grandfather Sri Kadim Duuan, an adherent of the ideas of Gandhi, who brought up a sense of justice, a love for reading and mathematics, had a great influence on the girl.  At twelve years old, Sudha herself, amazed at the helplessness of her grandmother, taught her to read.  Later memories from childhood will form the basis of one of her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Taught_My_Grandmother_to_Read">books</a> . <br><br>  Getting an education to a girl in India was difficult, a technical specialty is almost impossible.  Sudha Murthy proved the opposite - girls can get an education and achieve greater results than men.  She graduated from the Bumaraddi Engineering and Technology College with a gold medal (she was the only girl in college for all the time she studied), then she graduated from the computer science department of the Indian Scientific Institute with a gold medal and entered graduate school.  Now in engineering specialties in India, almost half of the students are girls, then Soudha was alone in her department.

    <h3>  Work and personal life </h3><br>  In April 1974, Sudha finished her postgraduate studies and waited for her departure to the USA, where she was supposed to continue her education.  By chance, she came across an advertisement for the recruitment of engineers at <abbr title="TATA Engineering and Locomotive Company">TELCO</abbr> , one of the largest companies in India.  The most common announcement, with the postscript: "Please do not disturb the girls." <br><br>  Sudha was so indignant that she wrote an angry letter.  Since she did not know a single address, she wrote directly to the head of the TATA Group, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._D._Tata">Jehangiru "JRD" Tata</a> , whose address she saw in the newspaper.  To the surprise of the girl, after 10 days she received an invitation for an interview.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an excellent reason to go to Pune and buy sari known to all of India for yourself and your friends,‚Äù thought Sudha, who wasn‚Äôt going to stay in India and didn‚Äôt believe she would be taken. <br><br>  Six people came to the interview with Sudha.  In two hours she answered all the questions asked to her.  ‚ÄúDo you know why we wrote that we do not need girls?  Because we never had women in the workplace.  This is not a college for co-education, it is a factory.  At the institute you were always the best, we admire it.  But such as you are more suitable scientific work ... ", - said to her.  ‚ÄúThen you have to start somewhere, otherwise women will never work for you,‚Äù Sudha said.  After these words, a new stage began in the history of TELCO: for the first time a woman was hired as an engineer. <br><br>  Sudha worked as a development engineer for 8 years.  She personally meets the head of the TATA Group, Jehangir Tata, who inspires her to do charity work. <br>  Here she met her future husband Narayana Murthy.  For the sake of his next dream, she leaves the job at TELCO, gives him 10,000 rupees (~ 200 dollars) and at first helps as a programmer, but then completely takes on the role of a housewife and a happy mother of two children.  Narayan‚Äôs dream is called Infosys.  For three years, Sudha sought permission for marriage from her father, who considered Narayana not serious enough, paid for her husband in cafes and cinema.  Now the total capitalization of Infosys Limited amounts to $ 32 billion, the fortune of Narayan Murthy is $ 2 billion, and the English language is enriched with the verb <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580">‚Äúto bangalore‚Äù</a> . <br><br><h3>  Charity </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ZcnjnXRA88" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In 1996, the Infosys Foundation set up a charity foundation of the Infosys Foundation, headed by Sudha Murthy.  The main activities of the foundation are the fight against hunger, education and health.  At the expense of the foundation, orphanages, hospitals, hospices, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala_(type_of_building)">daramashals</a> are being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala_(type_of_building)">built</a> , ethnic festivals are held, children from the lower strata of the population receive education, the foundation is engaged in identifying and supporting girls who have become <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8">devadasis</a> .  The Foundation takes part in disaster management, cooperates with non-governmental charitable organizations. <br><br>  During the time of work, libraries were created in 50,000 schools, 13,000 schools were equipped with toilets, and 2,300 houses in the disaster area were restored.  Its budget has grown from 40 thousand dollars in 1996 to 65 million dollars in 2015. The Infosys Foundation USA, which is engaged in promoting programming in US schools, was opened. <br><br><h3>  Literature </h3><br>  Despite impressive charity work, Sudha Murthy is also known for her literary works: children's books and popular science books, artistic prose, there is a wonderful essay on Russia.  Her books are popular in India and translated into 15 languages, including English.  In her works they make films in Bollywood, and Sudha, a fan of cinema, plays herself with pleasure. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  On the eve of March 8, I will complete the article with a quote about Sudha Murthi about beauty: <br>  ‚ÄúWhat makes a person beautiful?  This is not makeup, flowers or jewelry, not clothes or bracelets - none of this makes a person truly beautiful.  Real beauty is kindness in the heart, confidence on the face ... Those who achieved harmony between the heart, actions and mind are the most beautiful people. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Interesting materials </h3><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://amoalsale.wordpress.com/2008/05/20/story-of-infosys/">History of Infosys from Sudha</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://www.indiamarks.com/love-story-narayana-murthy-and-sudha-murthy/">Instructions on how to become the billionaire's wife</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://andurle.blogspot.ru/2015/07/a-wedding-in-russia-by-sudha-murthy.html">Side view of the Russian wedding traditions</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://www.amazon.in/Sudha%2520Murty/e/B00J5XX9CO/ref%3Dla_B00J5XX9CO_pg_3%3Frh%3Dn%253A976389031%252Cp_82%253AB00J5XX9CO%26page%3D3%26sort%3Dauthor-pages-popularity-rank%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1488436356">Bibliography</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/Akansoft/sudha-murty-the-great-industrialist-and-author">Presentation about Sudha Murthy</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="">Interview about charitable activities</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370205/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370205/</a></p>
