This spring, until <b>April 17,</b> Russian undergraduate and graduate students have the opportunity to compete for this honorary title! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4ba9a120/dfc39c24/a34a2af1/ca00c318.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What is an MSP program? </h4><br>  This is a form of cooperation with Microsoft, when a student (graduate student) becomes a representative of the corporation in his university.  MSP are the <b>most talented and active</b> students (graduate students) from around the world, <b>passionately</b> fond of technology.  Instead of participating in exciting activities at the university and transferring their knowledge to other students, MSP receive many benefits, as well as the opportunity to get <b>real-world experience</b> and make your <b>resume</b> attractive.
