We invite QA-engineers to our first test automation meeting dedicated to automation. <br><br><h3>  Program </h3><br><h4>  ‚ÄúAutotest, combining approaches, platforms and hearts‚Äù, Mikhail Chirkov, ivi.ru </h4><br>  Advantages and disadvantages of cross-platform autotests (in our case, talking about android and web platforms), implementation complexity and ways to solve problems when building autotesting from scratch, screenplay vs pageobject.  Or maybe choose and not need? <br><br>  The report will be interesting both to those who are faced with the choice to write monoplatform tests or cross-platform tests, and to those who have already made their choice. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  ‚ÄúAutotest there?  And if you find? ‚Äù, Alexey Petrov, FunCorp </h4><br>  Communicating with candidates for interviews, coming with consulting or to a new job, often faced with the case of the widespread and passionate desire to implement test automation.  In this case, surprisingly, the situation is often accompanied by a number of obstacles.  And it‚Äôs good if this is just a lack of knowledge and automation skills, the situation is a bit worse if there are problems with the allocation of resources for this kind of activity (time, infrastructure, etc.), well, it's really bad when there are obvious problems with understanding " Why do we need automation? ‚Äù

      In my report, I will talk about this situation from two sides: from the perspective of a testing specialist and from a company.  Naturally, I will talk not only about the problems and their causes, but also about how to deal with them and successfully cope with their own experience in implementing test automation in the work process and building an automation pipeline. <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúContinuous Integration and Automation‚Äù Alexey Khalaidzhi, Mail.Mail.ru </h4><br>  As part of the report, I will talk about what processes it makes sense to automate when developing a large product in order to increase the efficiency of interaction between different departments and speed up the product release without loss of quality. <br><br>  The story will be based on the history of the development of CI-infrastructure in the development of a mobile application for iOS: <br><br><ul><li>  The delights of life without CI and automation </li><li>  Who needs CI and why? </li><li>  What tasks it makes sense to automate and at what stages of product development? </li><li>  Testing as an important part of the release cycle </li><li>  Continuous integration levels </li><li>  CI as a centralized means of communication and solving common problems between all participants in the product development process </li><li>  CI architecture in Mail.Ru Mail client development team </li><li>  Continuous integration of departments in automation </li><li>  Continuous Test Automation </li><li>  CI as a product quality metric </li></ul><br><h4>  ‚ÄúUnit testing as a tool for QA engineers‚Äù, Nikita Kuznetsov, Tinkoff.ru </h4><br>  Automating everything and everyone is the traditional way of automating the regression of many companies.  However, there comes a time when the number of tests becomes so large that all the working time is spent not on creating new autotests, but on supporting those already written. <br><br>  I will tell you how our team has foreseen a similar situation and has established a process that allows us to increase the coverage of the regression with the lowest support costs. <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúParallel autotesting and other elegant ways to speed up the delivery of features‚Äù, Katerina Sprinsyan, Badoo </h4><br>  We used to focus in Badoo mainly on manual testing.  It turned out a sort of manual regression deadlock: there was no time to write tests, because we tested a lot with our hands, and tested a lot with our hands, because there were no autotests. <br><br>  But we were able to set up our automation system and processes, broke this vicious circle and began to write valid tests. <br><br>  In my report, I will tell you how we managed to reduce the manual regression from 90% to 30% of the working time, while maintaining a decent level of quality and growing professionally! <br><br>  Register for the mitap <a href="https://funcorp.timepad.ru/event/943750/">here</a> . <br><br>  More information in our <a href="https://t.me/FunTechMeetups">Telegram channel</a> . <br><br>  For communication with the organizers, speakers and other participants works <a href="https://bit.ly/2sSg3VC">Telegram-chat</a> . <br><br>  For those who can not come on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxefbirKEpPrqo6AmHEHP1A/videos">Youtube-channel</a> will be an online broadcast. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446248/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446248/</a></p>
