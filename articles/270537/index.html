There will be a lot of text, smaller pictures.  Go! <br><br>  <b>Childhood</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/64f/830/925/64f8309250bda4de217bf754bfab43ec.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I just want to note that I didn‚Äôt have any friends or parents of programmers, therefore, there was no one to inculcate the love for this profession!  Childhood was held under the slogan "Dendy forever".  Every day I spent several hours in the company of BattleToads, ButtleCity, Mortal Combat, Black Cloak, Bomberman and other titles that were popular at that time.  I didn‚Äôt just love to play - I adored to madness.  Sweaty palms, broken joysticks, a light children's mat after another death - all this was present in large numbers.

      I didn‚Äôt get a computer at that time, but I realized that on a PC the depth of games and the quality of graphics were three heads higher than on a small pirate console with yellow cartridges.  True, the miracle machine was with my neighbor, where I could play a little in the desired Heroes 2, Diablo 2, Karmagedon, Truckers!  The world of computer and computer games fascinated me so powerfully that I decided to connect my life with this industry! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/251/30e/2b6/25130e2b6ba20e50c5608100af0d92c8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I didn‚Äôt think for a long time, I asked my mother for some money for programming courses that were held on the basis of Kharkov Aviation Institute.  That's it, I thought, with the help of reserved words and teams, I will create unique fantastic worlds, tangled plot, draw wonderful characters, azure dragons and knights in shining armor!  Together with a couple of friends, squeezing denyuzhku in the palm of my hand, I moved to the conquest of heights!  The heights were not as bright as I imagined it ... <br><br>  The audience gathered about 20 people.  The room was large and spacious.  There were quite modern computers around the perimeter!  Pens and notebooks were already lying on a large oval table awaiting King Arthur, that is, our programming teacher, who was a little late.  Looking around, I noticed that basically the entire contingent is the same 13-14 year old guys like me.  Only two guys stood out who were noticeably taller than us and three years older!  After a long wait, our meter entered the audience - Anatoly (patronymic, unfortunately, I don‚Äôt remember) and immediately let us know - we will work on the first 5 lessons with pens and notebooks, and wait a little while with the computer!  AS?  I specifically came here to sit behind this wonderful devil-machine, and here such a bummer. <br><br>  If anyone has not guessed, then my first language was a great and terrible PASCAL!  DOS, blue screen and yellow-white characters that were Chinese for me at that time!  How could Heroes 2 be made of all this?  Where can I draw armor for a character?  How to make a map of the world?  Integer, char, boolean: a lot of new information, which in no way brought me closer to the creation of computer games.  Then I did not understand that all these numbers, variables and constants are a very important base for future projects! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c1c/c6d/36d/c1cc6d36d870938e0fe7cac8429c000f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In short, all programming courses boiled down to one scheme.  We came, wrote something down in notebooks, got a task, wrote it off as a clean one from two adult guys and ... and then there was the sweetest moment - WarCraft 2 on the net!  Wow, what battles we had!  Multiplayer for 6 people - it was something, it was many times better than childish pranks for a dandy along with a neighbor computer.  In general, I did not receive any practical knowledge, but I played plenty with Varick!  After these events, I thought that programming is not mine at all;  too hard, too incomprehensible.  I decided to start with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbecoming a programmer ... <br><br>  <b>First successes</b> <br><br>  After the ninth grade, my mother decided to give me to the lyceum at KhAI, which was considered one of the best in Kharkov.  Institute teachers, a lot of homework, physical and mathematical orientation and ... and programming naturally! <br><br>  Pascal reappeared in my life with a new teacher by the name of Sokolov.  And she was gorgeous, for we almost all class code!  So good, kind and intelligent teachers need to search!  Perhaps, if it were not for the knowledge base that I received in the lyceum - I would not have written this story now. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/410/83d/555/41083d55587bf7535ecc9eccae59d74e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For the first time, after idiotic children's courses, I fell in love with programming and even started making small text games with answer choices - it was amazing!  I myself, with my own hands, created a certain story, mysterious worlds with various plot forks!  if - else ... switch-case ... miracles! <br><br>  But the school years are over and I had to go to college.  There were no tests at that time, for admission to the budget one had to be either an extremely talented comrade or have friends.  My fatal mistake was that I was led by my relatives and went into the construction industry, they say, it is always profitable and profitable.  Honestly, at that moment I didn‚Äôt really think about where to go to study, what will I be in the future, what do I want to do?  These questions did not really bother me.  My attention has shifted slightly towards Dota and Lineage 2 ... <br><br>  <b>2.0 programming courses</b> <br><br>  After graduating from the Academy of Municipal Economy in the specialty that ‚ÄúUrban Construction and Farming‚Äù sounded proudly, not the most fun times began.  Painting dance school, pouring mortar floors in the store, installation of base plates, suspended ceilings.  From the construction industry I just turned out.  Not only was the work often very dirty, so was the contingent of employees not the most encouraging.  But what to do ... I could not do anything else - I had to work in such conditions.  A little later, I was promoted a little and I became an assistant foreman.  Here then there was a lot of free time to think - what to do next! <br><br>  Thinking over my head, I decided it was worth trying to get a job at IT!  I had no particular doubts about the choice of language!  Poryskav on the Internet, I found cheap courses Java, and Java - this is not only a valuable web, but my favorite Android OS!  After waiting a week or two while the group meets, I proudly left the house to change the course of my sad existence a little! <br><br>  Almost everyone who surrounded me zealously dissuaded from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgoing to courses.  The girl was unhappy that we would rarely see each other, mom thought it was a waste of money, because in such specialties study for 5 years!  But my decision was final and irrevocable! <br><br>  This time the audience turned out to be quite tiny.  On one of the walls hung a cluttered drawing board.  There was a loud hum from the small window: it was the girls' training by shaping from the next building.  Our new teacher turned out to be a teacher from KPI, who actively worked as an interviewer for large Kharkov companies and tried to oversee our learning process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d48/583/f6c/d48583f6c4c8e1c723174b65bbeb8690.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The whole course was reduced to the fact that we analyzed the slides with a specific theme, rewritten all the code in eclipse and watched what we got.  I had a small handicap in front of the rest - after all, Pascal left an imprint of knowledge in my subcortical part of the brain.  To describe the quality of these courses, I will give just two vivid examples from our learning process. <br><br>  At the first lesson, our Sensei promised to create a mail, where we will throw off our homework for verification.  Naturally, the mail was never created, and the tasks ... who needs them, right?  For the courses have already been paid!  But most of all I was shocked by another moment.  After the end of one of the lessons, our group was given the task of making a simple analogue of the horoscope: gender - the sign of the zodiac - output to the console some kind of inscription.  I decided to go further!  I made a simple Swing interface, dug up the icons of zodiac signs and built such a bomzhegoroskop!  In fact - this was my first experience in creating an interface with logic!  The whole group in the next lesson sat and clicked on my project, marveling at the fact that I was a little overfulfilled with the task.  I think now Sensei will appreciate my creative impulse.  But seeing that I did our would-be teacher said only one phrase: ‚ÄúHere is the time for people to go.‚Äù  It even touched me a bit! <br><br>  From all the above, one could conclude that this is a failure!  But not for me!  These courses gave me some kind of base and a small fuse for further accomplishments!  And accomplishments, naturally, did not take long to wait ... <br><br>  <b>First job search</b> <br><br>  After the end of the pseudo-courses, my new friend Leonid and I began to look for my first job in IT!  The courses have finished - now take us, please, to work!  We are very good!  We do not know anything ... but good ones)!  Here the story is silent about Leni‚Äôs three attempts to get into NIX Solutions, and the HR whispers ‚Äúagain this cook came to us‚Äù;  our trips to tests in EPAM and Global Logic for internships.  I want to note that in EPAM testing was much more difficult, but much better organized!  True, both attempts failed for us to succeed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a70/42c/e29/a7042ce29dc534ee9b3da42b7a3462ac.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After some deliberation, it was decided to first write at least something, so that there was something to come to HR.  Then I immediately remembered my children's attempts to create simple text games and suggested that Lena do something similar together, only now in Java and with pictures!  No sooner said than done!  The process went, but very sluggish.  Leon very poorly understood programming and almost all the code I had to write to me!  After a month of these useless body movements, we abandoned this idea, although I even built a cheap analogue of the battle game from the BC. <br>  Leon decided to go into the layout, and I - try yourself in the android-development and did not lose!  Although the number of torments exceeded all conceivable norms ... <br><br>  <b>Android forever</b> <br><br>  Many, studying a certain technology, begin to practice on puzzles, some examples.  I decided to immediately do my pet-project!  Without preparation, without reading books - just saw the application!  Without hesitation, an Android Project was created with the name <u>English everyday</u> and rushed. <br><br>  The first lines of the code were incredibly hard!  Android manifest, developing an interface in XML, handling clicks - everything was just awful!  The whole interface floated like Odyssey across the seas, the application either worked, did not want to run, yielding some errors, and sent it to the manifest!  The first month was just hell!  Stack overflow has become my second home!  By the winter of 2013, I made the first build of my application.  There was no motivation anymore!  Coding was very hard, the project looked awful!  Everything fell and braked! <br><br>  I have already stopped doing coding daily, when suddenly I met my old friend Lenya in the city!  We got to talking and I showed him my firstborn on the phone!  To my surprise, Leon came to a wild delight!  ‚ÄúMishan, look, it works‚Äù!  ‚ÄúOh, I pressed the button and it fell, but the button works!‚Äù  This whole meeting breathed some fresh air into me!  I came home and began to search in Google for the most successful design solutions in the interface!  I learned about Behance and Dribbble.  After several months of work, my applique began to look very juicy, although each screen had its own absolutely unique style!  It turned out a kind of colorful parrot - cute, but completely tasteless! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee6/a74/e7a/ee6a74e7ae0c5f339c77186fa875c995.png" alt="image"><br><br>  $ 25 was transferred to a Google account - a developer account was received and English Everyday, my first serious application, appeared on Google Play and the w3bsit3-dns.com forum!  Naturally, I knew absolutely nothing about optimizing the interface for various screens, marketing, promotion, advertising exchanges, and so on.  I just completed the project, inserted a banner from Admob there and let it float freely. <br><br>  The first comments were not long in coming and, strangely enough, people really liked my application!  I actively began to add content and edit errors.  I didn‚Äôt know anything about connecting libraries then - everything was written by hand and from scratch!  Instead of using any BaaS, I poured texts and words into a blog on a blogger, and then pumped out the html page and parsed it!  Yes, the number of bikes in my project exceeded the entire Moscow fleet! <br><br>  Unexpectedly - unexpectedly, my English began to bring money!  Initially, only a couple of dollars a month, but for me it was already something!  Gradually, I began to notice that on the day I get 400-1000 organic plants from the market!  Having scored the keyword English in the search, I found that in issuing in Ukraine I overtook LinguaLeo!  LinguaLeo CARL!  The issue of Google search also showed that a large number of different sites themselves released my application to their servers, even some reviews were!  This is where full-screen banners appeared in English, which began to bring even more revenue!  $ 150 per month, then $ 200, then altogether 350 !!!  On my application, I began to earn more than on official work! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ed/ac4/6d5/0edac46d53e05d13c9186eda5f197d32.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Motivation jumped to unprecedented heights and I decided to start the second application, namely, <u>Everyday Weather</u> !  And then to the third - <u>Number Mix Saga</u> !  Naturally, often falling and not outlined weather application received its 1000-2000 installations and was forgotten.  Only after that I learned that weather applications are among the most low-leaping! <br><br>  <u>Number Mix Saga</u> also has not gained proper success!  To produce a simple logical game in which there was nothing unique in the era of the battle of multi-million marketing budgets - a meaningless undertaking! <br><br>  When developing the last two applications, I managed to master various alternative markets (Opera, SlideMe, etc.). <br><br>  <b>Move on</b> <br><br>  In early 2015, Google banned my wonderful English without noise and dust!  After all, the content for the application was taken absolutely from everywhere!  Pictures came from all over the Internet, sound effects, icons.  The entire resource set of English looked like Viktor Yanukovych‚Äôs dacha in Mezhigorye: we take everything that is bad and use it for our own purposes!  In the meantime, I joined a small company as an android developer, which slightly increased my professional potential. <br><br>  I did not fight with Google about my blockade, for I understood that the idea was absolutely a failure!  It was decided to do something similar, only bigger, better, more beautiful and without bugs!  No sooner said than done! <br><br>  In April of this year, I started my new project - <u>English 4 You</u> .  Having connected all my previous experience and one acquaintance I plunged into the development.  If before I knew absolutely nothing about mobile marketing, promotion of applications and alternative stores, then this time I prepared thoroughly.  A big development plan with mockups and sprints was prepared, the entire marketing policy was written both before and after the release of the application.  Developed press releases, collected some budget! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c62/3c0/774/c623c077431f3948748183eb569a57d3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first month of development was spent on Pinterest, Behance and Dribbble.  Realizing that the designer of me is not the best, I decided to choose the style of the future application from something ready-made and cute, and only then begin to develop.  Another week I spent on analytics competitors: Duolingo, LinguaLeo, Memrise, Busuu, 6000 words.  Almost all of them did not give any kind of complex base (not counting LinguaLeo).  Basically, all competitors specialized in increasing the base of words, while a lot of content was closed, with an offer to buy it in the future.  LinguaLeo is the undisputed leader in this field, a huge base of everything and everything: grammar, words, spelling, texts, dialogues, statistics!  And if everything is well organized on the site, then in the application itself - on the contrary, everything is too crumpled, plus an attachment to the local currency - meatballs. <br><br>  Based on the experience of similar applications, I finally decided that absolutely all the content will be completely free and accessible, the interface is simple and straightforward, and I will get profit only from advertising!  There was a choice of two advertising aggregators: <u>Appodeal</u> and <u>AdtoApp</u> .  After several tests on the trial application, <u>Appodeal</u> was selected.  <u>AdtoApp</u> then worked, for some reason, I received a letter in the mail saying that I had not set up something wrong and stopped working, while some mobile antiviruses were actively swearing when installing the test application.  Finally, I cannot say how good the Appodeal is, but so far everything suits me. <br><br>  August.  On the street +38.  All windows are open to plow.  The heat is unbearable.  The download slider in the Play Market is slowly reaching 100%.  English 4 You are sent to worldwide networks to conquer new heights, and I go to alternative app stores, to purchase services of motivated traffic, to the forum w3bsit3-dns.com.  Although the application is finished, there are no fewer problems: editing errors, refining the functionality, marketing. <br><br>  Here my little story is gradually coming to an end.  Plans for the future - Napoleonic.  What is the total of the above?  It is simple: strive to do what gives you pleasure, do not have to leave your current job, just self-develop and strive to make your product as interesting and convenient as possible.  Yes, maybe 100,500 problems and failures will fall on you, but this is not a reason to stop - this is the motivation for further progress! <br><br>  PS ‚ÄúWhy am I writing about games at the beginning - yes about games, and then I started developing applications‚Äù - the reader will think.  But because to make a good and beautiful game is a lot of work, decent financial investments and some kind of development experience.  I did not have it and I decided to make a start from what I could do.  But games are not forgotten, games are the next stage of my development! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/270537/">https://habr.com/ru/post/270537/</a></p>
