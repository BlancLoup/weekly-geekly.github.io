But when and with what to contact the client?  How not to lose a client or return it back?  And how not to become an obsessive spammer, but to be a good support? <br><br>  You can communicate with site visitors in 20,000 ways: pop-up windows, chats, emails, calls from the site, sms ... Blows up the brain on the number of options.  But when and how best to use them, so as not to scare the client, and to be at the right time in the right place. <br><br>  In this article we will try to answer, what messages should be sent to customers, when and how? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Greet your new customers </h2><br>  The first impression is extremely important.  It is important to create a pleasant attitude towards your product.  This will directly affect the reading of subsequent messages.  To create this first impression, your new customers should put the following points in a message to them: <br><ul><li>  greet them </li><li>  introduce you and your company </li><li>  ask how your site went through, </li><li>  suggest taking the next interesting step on your site, thereby giving them a reason to return. </li></ul>

      Choose a way to communicate: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a10/bd4/c00/a10bd4c008ea411a68bbc9b5d53e5e36.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Configure when and to which clients you want to display this message: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/218/633/738/218633738176f4deb5cc6ea6cdd08d57.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Write the text that fits the situation, and do not forget to tell you what to do next.  And run. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b1/448/b65/4b1448b65e0e925d51e119a03cb9a19e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Support your new customers </h2><br>  Do not think that people who subscribe to your service have become your regular customers.  Most likely, they only try.  Therefore, it is extremely important to check how your clients are doing a few days after they are registered on your site.  A good letter offering help and tips will show your customers that you are always here and ready to help them.  Here are some good ideas for such letters: <br><br><ul><li>  Send them a handwritten personal letter.  Such letters seem more personal and not stereotyped. </li><li>  Ask the question how your product helps them and if they have any questions about its use.  By asking questions, you show that you are interested in hearing the answers; </li><li>  Offer help in setting up or consulting in skype; </li><li>  Give them a discount; </li><li>  Specify the path to the documentation for your product. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Keep users interested in your product. </h2><br>  In your hands how to teach new users the functions and principles of your product.  Send messages to users based on what they use, what functions they are interested in.  Find out which mechanisms they don't use and why.  Help them see how they can benefit and how they can use them.  For this fit messages with the following topics: <br><br><ul><li>  What function can still be used on your site; </li><li>  What benefits for business can be obtained with its use; </li><li>  What you need to do to start using it (here you need to put a link to this function to go) </li></ul><br>  There may be many such letters.  It is important that they are related to what the user is doing on your site, and do not look like a random mailing throughout the entire database of your users. <br><br><h2>  Increase the number of messages with a prompting message. </h2><br>  A new user is always ready to abandon your service, so you should push him to purchase your product as soon as possible.  Offer him an incentive as soon as he comes to a decision point.  For example, if the free period expires after 3 days, offer a 25% discount if you pay for several months.  If the user has almost reached the limit provided at the current tariff, then offer him a discount for a higher tariff increase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cbd/749/a9d/cbd749a9d4c0825c56c611b0ef23d08c.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Communicate with the most beneficial customers for you directly </h2><br>  Not all users bring you the same profit.  Some users will pay zero rubles this month, while others will be ready to give you substantial sums.  It is necessary to distinguish between favorable customers for you and communicate with them directly.  In addition, customers are willing to pay, ready to answer questions and give answers that will help in the development of your service. <br>  You can put all the events on the site score and compare your visitors by points earned.  This will help you see interested visitors before they even go to the pay page. <br>  Or you can bind the message to the user to the event ‚Äúpurchase of expensive fare‚Äù + ‚Äúview help page‚Äù.  In a situation where your client, who gave you the money, needs help, he will receive a message in which you remind yourself and offer him help in setting up. <br><br><h2>  Anticipate your customers questions </h2><br>  It is good if you can quickly respond to the questions of your customers.  It‚Äôs even better if you can anticipate a client‚Äôs question before they ask it and give them an answer.  You can seriously reduce the time to support your customers if you act proactively.  Study the behavior of your users (so you can see the complex places in your service that require prompts) and help them when it is most needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e3/f51/15a/8e3f5115a4263c4127a78bb77a2e3b74.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Check regularly with your customers </h2><br>  You should be like a waiter in a good restaurant.  To approach the client with a question and not to miss the moment when he wants to order more or ask his question. <br>  Such messages should be sent to customers who: <br><ul><li>  just connected to your service (to find out they understood its benefits and are they ready to use them further), </li><li>  passed the trial period and began to use your service (they will be able to find out what disadvantages they found in your product and what benefits they began to receive), </li><li>  use your service for a long time, your loyal customers (from them you can find out which way to move in the development of your product) </li></ul><br><br>  As a result, in time addressing your website visitor, you do not send spam, but give the help that your client needs.  The difference is huge, and the border is very thin. <br><br>  In the <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/">carrot quest</a> service <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/">all these communication tools are</a> implemented and you can try them.  But they work best on the basis of web analytics, when you know where a site visitor is leaving, what he clicked, what he was interested in and what kind of events he performed on your site.  We will write a separate article about a bunch of web analytics and communication with site visitors. <br><br>  And about the event-based web analytics, building funnels, we wrote in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/carrotquest/blog/231045/">previous article.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/240459/">https://habr.com/ru/post/240459/</a></p>
