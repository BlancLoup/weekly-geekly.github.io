Want to cry, want not.  But this approach is rooted in software engineering, and I'm just stating a fact and voicing the reality that we have.  While thinking through the vision of a new methodology.  By analogy with the outdated Ajayl, I put 4 values ‚Äã‚Äãin the base of the new approach.  I will be glad to hear your opinion, or maybe you already use it and therefore you can share all the positive features of the approach. <br><br>  Manifesto of post-Soviet waterfall (aka new Ajal): <br>  ‚Ä¢ Psychic requirements management, more important than constant communication with the client <br>  ‚Ä¢ Grand program opportunities, more important than meeting customer needs. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Guidance only initial requirements, more important than constant refinements <br>  ‚Ä¢ Isolation of all project participants and improved workflow, more important is the loss of time for discussions. <br><br>  So, more detailed: <a name="habracut"></a>

      You have to hear that highly skilled engineers should not require customer requirements.  And in general, reduce communication with him.  The approach is a clear decomposition and distribution of responsibility.  There is sales (the seller), he shook out the customer TK.  Sales gave it to the development.  To put it mildly, without having understood the proposed solution, having received the estimate, he sold it to the client.  The management put strict isolation on the communication between the team and the client and gave full responsibility for the creation of the team to the development. <br><br>  But it is true.  It is enough to get a basic technical task, and then begin the development of analytics and programming from your expertise and knowledge.  After all, they are professionals, they can develop several options and offer it to the customer.  Argued that only such teams survive in our harsh world.  Of course, you apply some extrasensory possibilities of reading the customer‚Äôs thoughts from a distance.  But it does not matter, a flexible solution covered with tests and well-thought-out solutions will only increase from this.  And only such teams deliver real pleasure to the client.  Teams that, based on minimal information, isolated from the customer (product consumer), create high-class products.  Of course they create.  The probability is very high.  High-performance techniques will be used - TDD, pair programming, etc.  Just like in the present Agile.  And everyone will be happy.  But by ‚Äúeverything‚Äù is meant the development team, so they made the product of their dreams.  In the product, all the features that the team could only imagine, which could potentially be required by the client.  All tests pass.  Everyone is happy and looking forward to the appearance of the client in the office for the presentation of the product and the signing of the fact ... <br><br>  And then for a few months of development.  After signing the TK client appears.  Hurrying, talking on the phone comes into the office.  He is led to a presentation room.  The whole team is looking forward to the joyful sighs of the client and looks forward to incredible bonuses.  Everyone is jubilant. <br><br>  The customer participates in the presentation.  The team and the customer surrounded the client machine.  Development managers with the help of professional engineers explain and demonstrate the result.  For joyful explanations of the whole variety of advanced functional.  For passionate explanations.  People lost sight of the customer.  The customer is no longer interested with the team.  He has long sat down.  In his eyes the light that he woke up with today is gone.  He is already thinking about how to report to his management about the results of the work ... And when the presentation comes to an end, the team turns to him and asks - well, how?  To which he receives in response only one question, a shop top, with barely noticeable lowered corners of the mouth ... "What is this?". <br><br>  So, if you are a super development team and want to achieve the same amazing results.  Here is the manifesto: <br><br>  Manifesto of post-Soviet waterfall: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Psychic requirements management, more important than constant communication with the client <br>  ‚Ä¢ Grand program opportunities, more important than meeting customer needs. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Guidance only initial requirements, more important than constant refinements <br>  ‚Ä¢ Isolation of all project participants and improved workflow, more important is the loss of time for discussions. <br><br>  Minor comments. <br><br>  "Extrasensory requirements management is more important than constant communication with the client."  A good manager understands customer satisfaction will be only then.  When he will not be distracted by constant meetings, clarifications, etc.  The effect of "magic wand" is the best solution in the fight against competitors.  In addition, any manager understands that he hired engineers with higher education, with red diplomas, etc.  Therefore, these guys are sure to understand everything themselves and do it in the first class. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe grandiose opportunities of the program are more important than meeting the needs of the client.‚Äù  Having given all the responsibility to the team.  We motivate the team to accomplish!  No restrictions.  Only a basic set of customer requirements that the team must consider and envisage all potential customer needs, both now and in the future.  After all, a good manager understands the limitation of the team and its creative potential - it is bad to reflect on motivation and quality.  Give the reins to the team!  And the team will make you a candy with all unthinkable functionality. <br><br>  "Guidance is only from initial requirements, more important than constant refinements."  Intersects with the first.  Just reminds you that the client should not be disturbed.  Do not destroy his dream of a super program.  He wanted everything he wanted.  Now it's up to the professionals.  No wonder that software engineers have a higher salary than ordinary engineers. <br><br>  "Isolation of all project participants and improved workflow, more important is the loss of time for discussion."  This is the only way to control the process.  Each has its own area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility.  All are worthy of their leaders.  Team leaders tell me about the status.  No intersections!  Only specialization and the ideal realization of isolated parts at the end of the product will give an excellent result.  In addition, sales do not need to understand how the program will look.  But programmers do not need to spend time on empty talk with the client.  A good manager pays for work and lines of code - and only this is real work. <br><br>  If you recognize yourself in such a description I will be glad to hear your experience and the advantages that the approach proposed by me gives. <br><br>  Ps.  Of course, if you don‚Äôt really like this approach, you can join the Aja <b>and</b> L community.
