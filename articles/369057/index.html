This holiday is celebrated on the second Saturday of May.  Residents of the country sit on their iron "horses" and hit the road.  And although Cyclist Day does not have official status, it is highly esteemed among the Dutch.  In the CIS countries, this movement is only gaining momentum, but nevertheless, the ranks of cyclists are constantly growing.  In this regard, we decided to recall the history of the emergence of bicycles, as well as to consider the modern market for devices for this vehicle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/169/dd6/2dd/169dd62dd367483c848f6dc8e1622f11.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  History of </h4><br>  From time immemorial, mankind has used a wheel to facilitate movement on the ground.  Among archaeological finds, the oldest wheel is approximately 7,000 years old.  Throughout its history, people have found this item used in various types of carts, carts and chariots.  But the invention of Karl von Dres, who in 1814 created something like a two-wheeled scooter from wood, became absolutely revolutionary.  This unit became the prototype of the modern bicycle.  Baron von Dres called his ‚Äúrunning machine‚Äù (in German, Laufmaschine).  In contrast to the bike in the classical sense, this car did not have pedals, the scooter was driven by the fact that the rider pushed his feet off the ground.  The device was patented in 1817 and laid the official beginning of the history of cycling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b3/29e/765/0b329e7656cb4afb96b95e5db68a015f.jpg">

      <i>Bicycle of the German inventor Baron Karl von Drez</i> <br><br><cut>  But there are other versions of the creation of the first bike.  For example, it is said that for the first time such a device was created by the Russian craftsman Artamonov, a blacksmith, who was ahead of von Dres for the whole 14 years.  And although the blacksmith's model was quite successful (according to the story he overcame more than 5000 km on his bicycle!), He still failed to obtain a patent for an invention. <br><br>  In the early 40s of the XIX century, another blacksmith took part in the fate of the development of cycle construction.  A Scottish boy named Kirkpatrick Macmillan added pedals to Drez‚Äôs bicycle, which set the rear wheel in motion.  Despite the fact that the invention of Macmillan was ahead of its time and at the same time was not given the attention of the general public, his model formed the basic principles of the modern bicycle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68f/b5d/2a1/68fb5d2a17174430b0839891434265f1.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Macmillan Bike</i> <br><br><h4>  Bicycle development </h4><br>  In 1853, Pierre Michaud patented a pedal drive oriented to the front wheel.  The bike was equipped with a spring-loaded saddle and brake, and the model itself acquired the characteristic nickname ‚Äúbone shake‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea8/bdb/049/ea8bdb04904b4200b51517285f23d38e.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Bike Pierre Michaud</i> <br><br>  The bicycle's nickname was justifying itself - it was not easy to ride it, it required special skill and power.  But despite this, such vehicles attracted more and more attention.  In 1869, in one of the suburbs of Paris, even a two-kilometer race was conducted on such "bone-shakes".  The success of the event was indisputable and cycling has become quite a common hobby. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df1/0a0/ba3/df10a0ba3bda4d35a1587fe025858236.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Picture of the late XIX century</i> <br><br>  Another significant turn of history was the year 1867, when the English engineer Edward Alfred Kauper suggested using a metal wheel equipped with knitting needles.  And only a year later in Paris began the production of bicycles with chain drive rear wheel. <br><br>  Since 1870, models with a large front wheel, the so-called "spider-bikes", became fashionable.  They have been extremely popular for 15 years.  The pedals were attached to the front wheel, and the rear only served to maintain balance and was much smaller.  The huge size of the front wheel was justified by the fact that it allowed to gain high speed in one revolution of the wheel.  With a sufficiently large size, it was possible to accelerate to 30 km / h.  But by this the ‚Äúspider‚Äù rider exposed himself to no small danger.  Because of the size of the wheel, the cyclist was quite high above the ground, and any pothole on a rough road could lead to an unplanned bump.  A safe alternative to the ‚Äúspider‚Äù could be a bulky tricycle. <br><br>  Somewhat later, thanks to the English inventor Lawson, a chain transmission was added to the ‚Äúspiders‚Äù.  Such an upgrade gave them a new name - ‚ÄúKangaroo‚Äù.  After improvement, the speed was determined by the type of gears.  In 1880, about a hundred of such models were decorated in Petersburg.  They gained popularity and after a few years were presented in Moscow.  But the "kangaroo" could not cope with the harsh Moscow roads and very soon became outlawed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2be/621/3aa/2be6213aac2b41cda3bb571c91d0d88a.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Bicycle "Kangaroo"</i> <br><br>  In the following years, the development of bicycles became avalanche-like.  Approximately 6,000 patents were filed in the United States and England alone. <br><br>  Another turning point was the creation of the model Rover ("wanderer", "tramp") by John Kemp Starley in 1884.  The bike had wheels of the same size, a chain drive on the rear wheel and a seat between the wheels.  It is this bike that received the title of "safe" (Safety). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad9/705/459/ad970545988c403ea659bfb4b0785d4f.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Bicycle rover</i> <br><br>  But, perhaps, the complete transformation of the bike completed the contribution of the Scot, Johnny Dunlop, who added a pneumatic hollow tire.  Initially, Dunlop wanted to somehow soften the ‚Äúbone-shake‚Äù of his son and used for this irrigation hose, worn on the wheels.  Later, he filled the hose with water first, and then with air, which provided a higher device speed. <br><br>  The development of bicycles and the growth of their popularity have led to the fact that they have become not only a popular hobby and a way to keep yourself in good shape, but also a real vehicle.  And for someone, even an integral part of style. <br><br>  In modern life, the diversity of bicycle models has reached such an amount that their description is beyond the scope of this article.  But, as is often the case, an increase in quantity leads to changes in qualities.  Similarly, here the progressive development has shifted to a new plane, leaving the chapels of the ‚Äúwheel friend‚Äù itself and including a series of accessories and gadgets for bicycles. <br><br><h4>  Modern gadgets </h4><br>  To date, the world has created a huge variety of different devices designed to improve various aspects of using a bicycle.  Consider some of the most interesting and useful. <br><br>  <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/y0"><b>Waterproof GPS *</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/616/862/6ad/6168626ad738404ba4d9a69cfc85ddf4.jpg"><br><br>  The device, which was obviously lacking in the blacksmith Artamonov, who was driving along the roads of Russia at the beginning of the XIX century.  A modern computer with a highly sensitive GPS, equipped with a powerful waterproof protection, allowing it to be immersed in water for 1 meter for up to 30 minutes.  More than enough for the most severe pouring rain. <br><br>  <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/y1"><b>Cable alarm *</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/210/100/fd6/210100fd6a5a451c954e5ddb93f58b63.jpg"><br><br>  Given the cost of modern bikes, attention to their protection against theft is more than justified.  This protection system is equipped with an impressive cable and a siren, which produces a loud sound when the lock is shaken or attempts to cut the cable. <br><br>  <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/y2"><b>Bicycle bag for smartphone *</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ce/e17/864/8cee178648624490b18aa4abb0b69155.jpg"><br><br>  Smartphones have long been an integral part of human life.  This bag is attached directly to the bike, helps keep the smartphone in sight, protect it from rain.  But the most important thing is that it makes it possible to interact with the touch screen through the film of the bag itself. <br><br>  <b>Programmable wheel light</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08b/3cc/a10/08b3cca1080d4d649e8270ff7e52954a.jpg"><br><br>  Obviously, a bicycle is not only a vehicle, but also a way of self-expression, an element of individual style.  This <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/y3">gadget *</a> allows you to make your bike more colorful and original.  The installation contains several modes that create different patterns and pictures when the wheel moves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef2/cf6/398/ef2cf6398c7c423cad6d3658e2ebb3f4.jpg"><br><br>  There are a great many such <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/y4">light paintings</a> that can give a bicycle a unique appearance. <br><br>  <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/y5"><b>Bike MP3 *</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22b/247/8e0/22b2478e0c4341e5ac8646cd3b081194.jpg"><br><br>  The developers also made sure that listening to music while driving was as comfortable as possible.  The music center has a wide range of functions and can be attached to the body of the bike.  Listening both through headphones and through the speaker is available. <br><br>  <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/y6"><b>LED signal *</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eab/a95/256/eaba9525603a4eed827b1db7c6f2014f.jpg"><br><br>  Irreplaceable adaptation in the conditions of brisk automobile traffic.  The rear light has several modes that make the rider more visible on the road.  In addition, the device projects two lines of red light on the sides of the bicycle, which marks the space of the cyclist and reminds drivers of the existence of cycle paths. <br><br>  <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/y7"><b>LED gloves *</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80e/381/d17/80e381d1706c45a3a322e78c715b899d.jpg"><br><br>  Another element of bright style.  Gloves are specially designed for night cycling.  To change the color and mode of operation of the LEDs, just one click on the wrist. <br><br>  <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/y8"><b>Handsfree water container *</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3b/5bf/8e0/f3b5bf8e080c41239cfcaf526dab0695.jpg"><br><br>  Water container of this type will help to continue to ride without stopping for a long time.  The volume of the tank is 2 liters. <br><br>  <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/y9"><b>Sports camera *</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/88a/fa5/11d/88afa511d8584653b55a141124da61f0.jpg"><br><br>  To capture the most interesting parts of the route will help reliable sports camera, which is also protected from water penetration and from impacts. <br><br>  <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/ya"><b>Solar spotlight *</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/846/115/71e/84611571e1984cd6870d0650779faa90.jpg"><br><br>  This device can be another successful addition to the complete set of the bike.  It is especially useful for long cycling trips.  In addition to projectors, the station can also charge other devices like smartphones and cameras. <br><br>  <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/yb"><b>Portable repair kit *</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/926/262/de5/926262de53b2493ab1ea97e3d25a0059.jpg"><br><br>  Obviously, the repair kit has always been relevant.  One of the advantages of this set of tools, created specifically for cyclists, is their compactness and versatility. <br><br>  So, the modern bicycle is not only the mechanism itself, but also the devices accompanying it.  In its history, the bicycle has gone a long and intense path of development.  As for the future, it is obvious that the tendency of equipping a bicycle with additional gadgets and its integration with modern technologies will only increase. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> * - referral links marked with an asterisk, so you can save further by returning cashback up to 3%.
