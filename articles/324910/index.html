  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do you need a manufacturer‚Äôs service for IT equipment and its cost estimate?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It would seem a rather simple question - technical support, or as it is often called, service manufacturer, but how different are different people to buy it, depending on their job responsibilities and role in the company. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The main thing that you need to know about the service (technical support) of the manufacturer is that this is your insurance for all occasions and so it is worth treating it.  Let's say, you don‚Äôt buy insurance after the insured event, and, most likely, you won‚Äôt even think of it, but with the service, this is quite a common story that we‚Äôll not buy now, but if that happens, then and buy.  When something happens, most likely, it will be too late, because not every manufacturer will give the opportunity to order a service for already ‚Äúburnt‚Äù equipment, and if it does, then the service needs to be purchased and it must be activated by the manufacturer, and this time, and decent, sometimes up to two months.  And then open the case, get the approval of a TAC engineer, and only after that you will be brought equipment for replacement, and this is if you buy the appropriate type of service, involving an advance replacement of equipment, such as NBD. <br><br>  In other words, this is all in the plane of risk assessment from the occurrence of an event, in this case the inoperability or improper functioning of this or that equipment for a certain period of time, and the influence of this factor on the company's existing business processes, for example, damage from slowing down or temporary suspension of the company's operating activities (which is quite likely in case of failure of an important network node in the absence of its reservation) and other losses, which, if desired,  and about five, but usually, it is possible to calculate in terms of money.  In some cases, this is still worth adding reputational and other intangible losses.  Thus, service is expensive or cheap, should not be considered in absolute monetary terms of its value, but relative to the possible damage to the company, multiplied by the probability of an adverse event, taking into account the time of its operation, which depends on the presence or absence of the service.

      In addition, no engineer, whether he is the most intelligent and ingenious, can not and should not solve problems related to the competence of the equipment manufacturer.  The statement of the question in the form: ‚ÄúWhat is this for me as an engineer who cannot solve all the problems with the equipment without service and why does he get paid?‚Äù Is not correct.  In order for everything to function correctly and to work stably, it is not enough to have a competent engineer, you also need to give him a tool to communicate with the manufacturer and the possibility of escalating it to the problems arising with the equipment, i.e.  buy a service. <br><br><h4>  And a few more important points. </h4><br>  First, the service is tied to the serial number of the equipment and by registering this equipment on the manufacturer‚Äôs website, you inform the manufacturer that this equipment is on your account and you, as the owner of this account, have the right to access the software and be able to open cases in Technical Assistance Center (TAC), as well as an advance replacement of equipment, if any. <br><br>  Secondly, if you purchased the equipment and after a time it was upgraded, say, we bought additional components that do not have a separate service, for example, a backup power supply, however, sometimes the interface module or the spare control card may also not have its own service, but fall under the service on the main equipment where these components are installed, then do not be lazy to inform the manufacturer about this, just registering on the manufacturer‚Äôs website and these separately purchased additional components as rules  Adding them to the main equipment.  Otherwise, in the event of a malfunction, it is quite possible that only the equipment itself in the basic configuration, which you originally bought, will be brought to you for replacement. <br><br>  Third, do not forget to indicate the actual installation address of the equipment when registering.  This is important if the manufacturer has several service warehouses in Russia, as in this case, the reserve will be assigned to the warehouse closest to the equipment installation site and the time required to deliver the equipment for replacement will therefore require less. <br><br>  And fourth, you do not need to send cables, fixtures, and other similar elements, which are originally included in the delivery package, with the defective equipment; touch upon that no one will return them to you, and the new equipment for replacement may come without them. <br><br>  In any case, I highly recommend to find out from the seller (reseller), even before the purchase of the service, all questions regarding the fact that a particular type of service includes in what time frame and how it turns out and how to use it correctly.  And all this is not generally somewhere in a spherical vacuum, namely in the territory of the Russian Federation.  This does not mean that the seller sold the service and forgot, although in many cases it happens, and above all will help you in an emergency not to waste time or, even worse, to have expectations that simply do not correspond to reality. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324910/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324910/</a></p>
