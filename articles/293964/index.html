  <section class="page js-page"><h1>System administrator or system engineer?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Good afternoon friends. <br><br>  In this post, I would like to talk (and discuss) what the professions of the system administrator and system engineer differ in (and what are they like), what are their advantages, what are the disadvantages, and why. <br><br>  The post aims to consider the proposed topic and is aimed at a young IT audience who are still at the beginning of their career and professional career.  So, anyone interested, welcome under cat.  There will be a lot of letters. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So why is all this necessary?  Not always the young specialist has, in my opinion, an understanding of where to move globally.  It is clear that many want to be heads, managers, their business, etc., but in any case, one must be aware that this is still the lot of a very small part of people.  For both objective and subjective reasons, which we will not consider here.  From my own experience, I will say that there is nothing wrong with being a techie in 40+ years.  I personally like ts  ‚ÄúTurn the screws‚Äù, and I didn‚Äôt really like the experience of a managerial position.  Both in terms of what needs to be done and in terms of the environment in which to work.  If it is interesting, I can tell in the update why after working for about a year as a manager, I still returned to the techies and the money prospects did not become a deterrent.

      I went to admins at the call of my heart and soul.  It was back in 1996.  Honestly, from that moment on and for quite a long period I did not bother with the terminology of my post.  Admin and admin or "doing computers".  Therefore, in my work there are records of quite surprising content.  Up to the "mechanic on computer systems."  Here I am not lying.  It only later became clear that there is a helpdesk, there are admins, there is a first line, a second, etc.  Having started working with a tiny company with 10 computers, I got to the company with a fleet of approximately 300 PCs (do not try to repeat this experience, I highly recommend following the loss of physical and mental balance and a long period of coming to life after) and about 1500 PCs like admin team.  In total, I worked as an admin for 14 years, changing my place of work about once every 3 years.  Then he moved to the integrator as a system engineer, where I‚Äôm working successfully for the current moment (and I don‚Äôt have the desire to leave).  Therefore, I can both compare and evaluate both these professions and highlight both the advantages and disadvantages of both.  What I want to share below. <br><br>  For 14 years and some rotation of workplaces, I derived for myself a model of the life cycle of work as an administrator in an office.  About half a year is spent on entering the course of business (usually you accept an office with an already prepared infrastructure of one or another depth of curvature, in your opinion, a professional).  Sometimes less, sometimes more.  Then you brush the system for about a year, subordinating it to you with a clear ideology, when the system becomes intuitive and you clearly put everything in its place.  Then for about half a year you enjoy the ‚Äúgod‚Äù mode, when everything works, and you, hand on heart, are already picking your nose.  But you are still interested.  And after this period, which usually falls within two years, you start to get bored.  For if my model is correct, then everything works for you, you solve problems using less and less brain and, as the hero Vitsin said in one short film, ‚Äúno romanticism‚Äù.  And somewhere after a year of reflection, you are writing a statement, changing your place to a warmer, satisfying, profitable, calm, etc.  and the cycle repeats.  Please note that the last part, when you start to miss, is my subjective perception.  I know a lot of admins who seek this out. <br><br>  So, what is good about your system administrator?  First, if you are not working in an IT company (and this is most often), then you work with people who do not understand what you are doing.  Yes, and they are not particularly interesting.  The main thing is not chopped with them all day in any toys.  Some it really infuriates.  Secondly, the work of the admin is pretty well paid.  Thirdly, you work in comfortable living conditions (heat, light and flies do not bite).  And if you are a good admin, you have personal time and certain levers of influence.  Most often, you will love the leadership, and this is a valuable feature, because  other admins love is not always eager and need someone who will protect you from aggressive madmen.  But this is on condition that you are a really good admin.  Well, the responsibility of the leadership is also welcome. <br><br>  It would seem that adminstvo - this is a dream job.  But is it?  Let's look at the cons of the admin.  First, the first minus you encounter is money.  When you pump yourself up to a sufficiently powerful admin and come to a stable company in which everything is stable, then accept the fact that how much you bargain for yourself at the interview will most likely be a ceiling.  Well, maybe plus another 10 percent. In very rare cases, 20 after a year or two of work.  This follows from the fact that the volume of tasks that you will solve is unlikely to change dramatically.  Qualitatively, yes, but it depends on your cleanliness and diligence.  But this is your job.  Otherwise, everything will be characterized by ‚Äúwhat do you pay more for?‚Äù.  Secondly, you will solve the same problems.  They, of course, will have different sources, but some common nature.  Thirdly, anything that goes beyond the company's needs you will study on your own and at the expense of your resources.  You are given a network with antivirus, mail and the Internet - that's all.  Engage.  Do you want to download through ziska, telephony, video conferencing or programming - this is your personal.  And the mailer will be the same and antivirus.  Therefore, if you want to study in detail something fundamentally new, then most often it will be a change of work. <br><br>  Well, the main problem of the admin, in my opinion (perhaps it is already nervous).  You work, time is ticking.  You grow up, the young grow up.  And already begin to breathe in your back.  On the one hand, you manage the infrastructure well, but on the other hand, with age you are more expensive for the company (one way or another), and now it‚Äôs a turn with a glowing eye and ready to work for food.  So the option and your loss in similar opposition is not excluded.  And the transfer of cases - just a matter of documentation details.  Of course, in this paragraph there is a certain grotesque, but this option can not be excluded.  And since  admin long one place you become a highly specialized specialist, finding a new job can be a challenge. <br><br>  As a conclusion, we can say that the admin work quietly, but boring, money, but not the fact that it is for very long.  And you quickly get used to the measured routine. <br><br>  In summary, what I wrote above is my own conclusion, which I made several years ago.  And after such a conclusion, I decided that I had to go to the engineers.  I worked as an engineer for a while.  Less than five years.  But this, in my opinion, is enough for certain conclusions.  Although for me deciding that I really do not want to change jobs. <br><br>  So, what good is an engineer?  I consider the work of an engineer in the system integrator.  Those.  in a company that designs solutions for many customers.  The most important thing that attracts in the work of an engineer is constantly something new, constantly pumping knowledge and skills.  The customer has its admins who are doing what I described above.  And you, as an engineer, having designed one system (or subsystem) receive a task for another, a third, etc.  And they are not all alike.  Moreover, you can get a task for which you will need to spend time learning.  And in the integrator, this is normal.  No your knowledge will not be superfluous, because  no one knows what will ‚Äúshoot‚Äù in the next order and this is encouraged.  Of course, if this does not go against your current task.  This is the first.  Secondly, you will most likely be certified in various areas.  The integrator needs to have certified specialists on staff to receive orders.  And this, again, pumping, because  sometimes you have to give up everything that you want.  Thirdly, it is possible trips.  How many can boast that, for example, traveled all over Russia, having visited all of its subjects?  And you can.  After all, customers are anywhere.  Maybe even abroad (but this is so, it is possible, but ...).  Fourthly, you can move widely in requests for z.p.  No one is holding you back "it's not necessary."  It is necessary.  And the more valuable you are to the project, the better you will be appreciated. <br><br>  So, it turns out, this engineer is a dream job?  Not.  Since  and she has cons.  First, travel.  Will have to ride.  Not everyone loves it.  It is not always comfortable or convenient.  For example, I had a business trip, when for three days I made two flights, 21 hours on the train, 6 hours on a regular bus and three hours on a taxi.  Secondly, it is writing.  Unlike the admin, the engineer ‚Äúturns the screws‚Äù is disproportionately smaller.  Basically, this torsion is on the stands, because  commissioning is carried out on a set of documents that you write.  Therefore, you have to write a lot.  Sometimes very.  Thirdly, it will take a lot of things to learn.  Sometimes even in the mode, when you don‚Äôt know what to grab onto, and some kind of solution is already expected from you. <br><br>  As a conclusion, we can say that it is very interesting to work as an engineer, but sometimes there is a lot of work and it is 70% theoretical.  But the engineer does not suffer from the "back of the head" admin.  The engineer becomes like cheese, when ordinary is one price, and with mold it is much more expensive. <br><br>  Personally, the work of the engineer allowed me to take another look at the work of the administrator.  Since  I talked a lot and communicate with admins, I see that they really lack integrated, systemic thinking, when we first design, and then we drop the server on the shoulder and ‚Äúgo in to introduce‚Äù.  And in the end, finally you will find out that the words ‚Äúservers‚Äù, ‚Äúprocessors‚Äù, ‚Äúcontracts‚Äù are written this way, and not otherwise. <br><br>  Yes, both the admin and the engineer are horizontal, but in my opinion, the admin is much more vulnerable in the long run.  Although, all other things being equal, the admin will certainly work much more comfortably. <br><br>  Good luck to all who read this thread to the end.  I hope this helps with orientation in the difficult world of computer science.  I am pleased to answer questions if any. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293964/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293964/</a></p>
