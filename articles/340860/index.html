  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forward to the past: IT departments of companies 2018</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What does each company strive for?  Of course, to the growth and improvement of key indicators.  The activity of managers and departments within enterprises is constantly changing, trying (and not trying too) to constantly correspond to market fluctuations.  I work in a large corporation and watch the actions of many medium and small companies that want to become big.  Why do some succeed, while others do not?  In this article I decided to share with you some observations, and I propose to think together. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A steady trend towards the expansion of the IT market has been observed for more than a dozen years in a row.  However, for some reason today we see a statement in the news that ‚ÄúThe age of programmers is over‚Äù.  But indeed, initially the pace of the number of implementations of advanced technologies were quite high.  But, after a few years ago, an increasing number of solutions began to face the problem of quality, the pace of the emergence of new professional specialists and software releases decreased slightly.  Later, amid the global economic crisis, the decline of many companies led to cuts in allocated budgets, which in turn affected the slowdown in the growth of the industry as a whole. <br><br>  The factors listed above over the past few years have had a constant influence on the IT market.  At the end of 2017, there is a higher threshold for entry into IT for new specialists: in terms of knowledge, experience, completed projects.  Also, more and more companies pay attention to the quality of the products produced, since  testing, eliminating bugs takes a lot of resources.  At the same time, sometimes talk about saving and optimizing workflows inside advanced enterprises goes further.  Now ask yourself the question: do you know the IT department in any offline company that works completely on a remote basis? <br><br><h2>  Today will be tomorrow </h2><br>  I know that for many here the remote work of the IT department will be far from news.  But, if we return from the clouds to the earth, then we recall that this practice today is already ending its use in the world's leading IT corporations, such as Apple and IBM.  The objectives and results of the successful corporations cited as an example are several years ahead of the market.  And now let's look at a large number of enterprises, companies, start-ups that are just developing their IT departments and are introducing or launching new products.  Just here you can see exactly the issues that can be solved by transferring the type of cooperation with IT people (and not only) to a remote basis.

      If you take a little deeper, and look at the open statistics of freelancing services, then we can see how more and more specialists appear with more than 40 years of age in freelancing.  It's not about unemployment in old age.  Among them are many competent architects, people with entrepreneurial experience, and extensive experience as engineers in design bureaus.  The market dictates new conditions and makes its own adjustments to the portrait of a modern freelancer.  Design and layout becomes more professional, and raising the age and experience of yesterday‚Äôs young people, such as programmers, is beginning to have a positive effect on the quality of writing application code. <br><br>  The development and emergence of new technologies also makes its edits in the IT direction.  The use of new tools and integration with various online services allows you to more quickly and efficiently track the work processes of remote employees.  Cloud solutions, for example, the 1C accounting program, have long been offering remote data storage and access to company employees.  And not only from the office, but also from home.  Talking and reminding about the benefits of task-managers for teamwork is most likely meaningless.  Time trackers, Skype, checks throughout the workday - do you need to continue the list of tools with which a remote employee from home on a workday often gets closer than a similar employee on another floor of an office? <br><br><h2>  What to implement and how to plan? </h2><br>  Actually, this was the main reason for the growth of a large number of companies in 2017.  After all, whatever one may say, but practically everything depends on the staff.  And as it turned out as a result of my small survey among familiar clients who went up well in 2017, they really worked a lot with the staff and moved almost all positions to a remote basis.  Observing the success of large corporations, they were looking for ways not only to find highly qualified specialists, but also to keep them.  In addition to various buns, one of the most successful solutions turned out to be, so to speak, ‚Äúfreelancing‚Äù.  Not only did it save money on renting an office, it was also on the same freelancing that some managed to find ‚Äúfresh working brains‚Äù. <br><br>  Summing up, I think it can be said that next year for medium and large businesses one of the best decisions in optimizing IT departments will be the transition to remote collaboration.  Speaking about our corporation, successful examples of our clients, this allows us to reduce overall costs and get better performance of tasks.  I will not advertise now freelancers, but if I immerse myself in their atmosphere a little, then we can also completely agree that for them the constant remote work with the company is called ‚ÄúI have a good major customer‚Äù.  Let us recall here that the general requirement for improving the quality of IT products leads to the emergence of a demand for professional services, and this is fully consistent with the increase in the number of offers from experienced freelancing specialists in the last couple of years. <br><br>  At the end of this little reflection / forecast, I remind you that integration with third-party services and the introduction of modern solutions lead to an increase in the efficiency of the personnel of companies.  Now, analyzing the outgoing year, we in our company understand that in fact only one announcement at the beginning of 2017 that we are now moving to the remote location and can no longer go to the office allowed us to complete all the tasks of the current year already in mid-October.  From myself, I can add that there is more order in tasks and documents, and the presence of almost 2 free months at the end of the year, according to the additional plan and forecast, will give us about 10% additional growth in the main indicators.  Such a simple secret, following the market tendencies, allows us, a large corporation, to grow even faster, and our clients and partners to become small companies, and medium companies, big companies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/340860/">https://habr.com/ru/post/340860/</a></p>
