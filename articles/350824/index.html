  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Remote educational game creation program</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the Higher School of Business Informatics of the Higher School of Economics, we launched a new distance education program for advanced training ‚ÄúBasics of Game Creation‚Äù.  This is a short intensive course for a month and a half, the purpose of which is to develop in the audience a basic understanding of the gaming industry and the processes of developing and promoting games.  Details about the program under the cut, and you can sign up for it <a href="http://egame.hsbi.ru/">here &gt;&gt;</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5g/cd/t6/5gcdt6qgpge2mkv9la6uurmo3tq.jpeg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The gaming industry is a dynamically developing market with its own laws.  Hundreds of millions of players, a variety of platforms - from computers to mobile.  This is an opportunity to realize your wildest dreams of creating game worlds, and at the same time earn excellent money.  The volume of the industry in the past year, more than 100 billion dollars, and from year to year it increases.  But at the same time, the requirements for games as a product and how to promote them in the market are growing.  And now, in order to work successfully in the gaming industry, there are few burning eyes and an original idea - you need an understanding of the development process.  Knowledge of how to highlight the audience of your game and keep it.  It is necessary not only to make a quality product, but also to be able to launch it and maintain its successful functioning in the market!  And this can be done only with relevant knowledge. <br><br><h3>  Why a distance course </h3><br>  For more than three years, the professional retraining program ‚Äú <a href="http://game.hsbi.ru/">Management of Game Projects</a> ‚Äù has been going on at VSHBI with unchanged success.  During the eight months of full-time study, students receive knowledge that helps them determine their own path in the gaming industry, and successfully begin to move along this path.  But not everyone, especially from the regions of our country, could afford to spend eight months in Moscow to receive additional education.  And for them, as well as for those who, for one reason or another, do not have full-time tuition, we created a special distance course ‚Äú <a href="http://egame.hsbi.ru/">Fundamentals of Game Creation</a> ‚Äù - based on our time-tested professional retraining program.

Our course is the very foundation, owning which, the listener will be able to learn and develop further independently.  A distinctive feature is also the fact that all teachers are practitioners who not only have a lot of experience in the past, but are currently actively working in the field in which they teach.  That is why the course is filled with real-life cases and examples from practice, and also contains many practical, useful tools and recommendations.  Including - samples and templates of documentation, calculations and design documents required by any team. <br><br>  <b>The training program includes the following modules:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Methodology of game creation</b> : stages of game development, the logic of formation of teams in the gaming industry, key milestones and goals of the game product. </li><li>  <b>Numerical characteristics of games</b> : basic analytics, statistics and key product metrics (conversions, size and audience loyalty, virality, marketing forecasting, payback). </li><li>  <b>Game logic</b> : terminology, game features and cycles, tools for describing gameplay, creating game mechanics, balancing them and generating ideas. </li><li>  <b>Player psychology</b> : players' psycho-types, their differences, features, and use in creating the game. </li><li>  <b>Game design documentation</b> : how to develop a vision, concept, game specification, principles of good documentation, its types and approach to creation, based on the use of modern tools. </li><li>  <b>Technical basics of game development</b> : a review of technical solutions, platforms and engines, the process and cost of development, general principles and structural solutions in different countries. </li><li>  <b>Features of working with games on different platforms</b> : client and server solutions, physical and graphics engines, security, databases, software purchase, placement in gaming stores. </li><li>  <b>Typical development processes</b> : working with versions and delivery of the final version, daily stability, the release of updates, problems and bug fixes. </li><li>  <b>Operation of game projects</b> : how to properly launch and maintain the successful functioning of the game on the market. </li><li>  <b>Marketing of games</b> : understanding of the current state of the market, types and types of modern marketing, assessment of marketing effectiveness, target audience (methods of segmentation of players), promotion channels, marketing assets and PR. </li></ul><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UJ6ytSGWafA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3>  How is the learning process </h3><br>  Each module consists of clips on the topic of the lecture of the teacher, materials for independent study, presentations and document templates that can be used in the work on your game.  Training takes place completely remotely at any time of the day and in any country of the world.  For training, students need only a computer and Internet access.  Knowledge control is carried out in the form of online testing after studying each module.  Duration of training - one and a half months. <br><br><h3>  Development opportunities after graduation </h3><br>  Graduates of the program "Fundamentals of creating games" will be easier to get a job at basic positions in game studios.  For example, VSHBI graduates in full-time program are now working in companies such as Mail.Ru, Rocket Jump, 101XP, Destiny.Games, 1C Game Studios, GameNet, and many others.  More <a href="http://hsbi.hse.ru/programs/vocational_retraining/menedzhment-igrovykh-internet-proektov/pro-trudoustroystvo/">examples</a> . <br><br>  Another way is to develop as an indie developer, launching your own games.  VSBI graduates open their own gaming studios and create gaming products on different platforms with more than a million people.  You can see examples of projects at VSHB <a href="http://hsbi.hse.ru/programs/vocational_retraining/menedzhment-igrovykh-internet-proektov/proekty-vypusknikov/">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g9/gc/nc/g9gcnc1kjpqcln4zollftmllkoo.jpeg"><br><br>  At the moment, our distance course, ‚ÄúBasics of Game Creation,‚Äù is a reasonable alternative for those who want to develop in the industry, but have no experience and knowledge and cannot come to Moscow for full-time classes.  In addition - it is also significantly cheaper! <br><br>  Tuition is 26 000 rubles.  Following the results of training, a certificate of advanced training of HSE is issued. <br><br>  We invite you to join our program and take a step towards working in an industry where the eyes are burning, and work brings great pleasure.  Making games is often even more exciting and interesting than playing them.  <a href="http://egame.hsbi.ru/">You can sign up for the program on our website &gt;&gt;</a> <br><br>  We also invite you to come and meet us at our free events: <br><br><ul><li>  March 30, 2018 <a href="http://hsbi.hse.ru/events/open_lectures/otkrytaya-lektsiya-alekseya-filatova-lutboksy-pravda-i-mify/">open lecture by Alexey Filatov "Lutboksy: truth and myths"</a> </li><li>  April 4, 2018 <a href="http://hsbi.hse.ru/events/open_days/den-otkrytykh-dverey-po-programmam-igrovoy-industrii-04-04-2018/">Open Day</a> at the gaming industry </li><li>  April 18, 2018 <a href="http://hsbi.hse.ru/events/open_lectures/lektsionnyy-vecher-po-igrovoy-industrii-18-04-2018/">Game Design Lecture</a> </li></ul><br>  See you at our events. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/350824/">https://habr.com/ru/post/350824/</a></p>
