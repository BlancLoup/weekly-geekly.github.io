  <section class="page js-page"><h1>So who exactly is "Big Brother"?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Is there a more stupid and painful feeling in the world than when a good guy turns out to be bad?  The words of the song "And not a friend or an enemy, but so ..." here really does not fit.  The author of the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-20005699-71.htm">article</a> (the source from which this is written as a ‚Äúfree translation‚Äù) even makes such comparisons as the girl‚Äôs disappointment when she finds out that the cute boy she meets is married, in debt or an insurance agent!  In my opinion this is slightly exaggerated, but very much like the truth. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Vic Gundotra, Google‚Äôs vice president of product development, tells us that Apple‚Äôs path leads to a ‚Äúdraconian‚Äù future, when one person, one company dictates conditions to others and defines values ‚Äã‚Äãfor them (what we see in almost every anti-utopian work, be it cinema or literature). <br>  At one time, Apple made a lot of noise in its revolutionary (I did not specifically put quotes here) with an advertising spot.  Now, this video, in accordance with the realities of our time and the vision of our world, representatives of Google should look like this: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0lg44rU2oE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh3FA8MgyLCgzqBL4TBpPohli6fnQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It is very easy to come to this conclusion, you just have to think about such things as the reluctance to include Flash in your products, tight control over content in the AppStore, failure to use Theora in your browser ... It seems that all these actions are aimed at achieving good goals, but result, we have a ‚Äúcastrated‚Äù Internet on the iPad, a ban on completely harmless applications from cartoonists and politicians in the AppStore (while the Playboy application lives there quite comfortably) and inhibition in the development of new Internet standards. <br>  The author of the original article compares such statements with accusations voiced by Hugo Ch√°vez against George W. Bush.  is that he is the "Devil."

      On the other hand, Google itself also collects a considerable amount of information about us.  And often there are accusations that this amount of information seriously exceeds what we agree to provide about ourselves in the user agreement.  There are cases when these actions are even contrary to the law! <br>  Naturally, each of these companies has its own strategy.  In principle, one can continue the analogy given in the beginning of the article in order to describe two models of behavior (that is, if one presents the end user as a girl, and the described companies as suitor).  In this case, Apple acts as a witty and funny handsome, with whom, of course, is always fun.  Yes, he is not perfect, he doesn‚Äôt always do what they want from him, but he is reliable, he is comfortable with him, and he will do everything possible to convince his girlfriend that he will be better off with him than with anyone.  Almost Brad Pitt! <br>  In turn, Google is such a slightly awkward guy who knows how to work with his head and he is doing great at it.  He initially already knows a lot about his girlfriend, but he needs to know even more!  He says that this is the only way to make her truly happy.  Naturally, such an approach cannot but arouse suspicion.  If he climbs so out of his way, it means that he has conceived something, he is pursuing some kind of goal.  And among other things, he still has powerful friends and partners. <br><br>  If you dig deeper on the Internet, you can find the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story%3Fid%3D5727509%26page%3D1">publication ABCNews</a> , in which a question similar to the title of this article is asked, but already relative to Google itself. <br><br>  In fact, I personally like both companies very much, this is not blind fanatical loyalty and boundless love.  We all must understand that we do not exist for such large corporations, but they are for us.  Both companies have both advantages and disadvantages. <br>  For example, I really like the design and functionality that is laid in Apple devices, but nevertheless I prefer to replace a lot of things with free alternative implementations.  For me, the perfect MacBook is a MacBook with Linux on board.  Yes, and the iPhone with android is very cute to me (it seems to me an absurd situation where the user buys a product in which the manufacturer initially truncated the functionality - this is me now about such a thing as a jailbreak of a mobile macosi).  Yes, very often, revolutionary changes in the company's products very often cause dissatisfaction with the consumer, but often this is due to the reluctance to retrain and accept new things, and over time without these innovations, their former opponents do not represent their lives. <br>  Google is also good for its too much appetite for personal data.  I was very amused by the case when they ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù scanned private wireless networks.  Of course, such actions arouse suspicion even among particularly paranoid people, and no one knows for sure how then they will take advantage of all of our personal information.  On the other hand, we get search results that are more relevant than any other competitor, advertisements that can really interest and be without eyes, are wonderful and, most importantly, free services that often outperform desktop applications.  Naturally, receiving so many benefits, we have to put up with the fact that information about us can be stored in an unknown place and processed by strangers (machines). <br><br>  As a result, each of us decides who to trust and who does not, whom to love, and who is not very.  And the cases of blind commitment and readiness to almost engage in a fist fight with those who say bad things about the subject of adoration, to be honest, depress. <br>  Guys, let's not make holivars, squabble, fight, but simply calmly reap the fruits of the battles of big uncles and choose the right thing that we really need and try to circumvent the unnecessary things that are being imposed on us.  Both companies offer us a really high quality and worthwhile product! <br><br>  I have already quite seriously moved away from the original topic raised by the author of the original article, and I hope I provided readers with good ground for reflection. <br><br>  The original is <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-20005699-71.htm">here</a> . <br><br>  <strong>upd</strong> <br>  In connection with the thoughts that slip in the comments, I decided to add: this is not an article revealing the greedy nature and the exorbitant appetite of Apple or Google, this is not an article abusing the same companies.  Just a thought that Vic Handdora expressed (who, by the way, was previously the ideologist of the Microsoft software platforms ... it seems that the Internet giant decided to adopt a fighter who already showed himself well on the battlefield with the Yabloko players, well, or at least doing such actions) seemed interesting to me, as well as what Chris Matyszczyk describes in his article.  Each of us has our own vision of this problem and, of course, we should not immediately reject other thoughts, at least in order to try to look at everything from a different angle. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94332/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94332/</a></p>
