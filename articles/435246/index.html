Tesla electric cars are available, first of all, to Americans.  This is relevant, in particular, in relation to the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù Tesla Model 3. This was so until the beginning of 2019. <br><br>  But now the situation has changed - the company has opened the possibility of processing pre-orders for customers from Europe and the USA.  The procedure for registration has not changed - in order to reserve an electric car, you need to make a deposit of $ 1000.  Two versions of Tesla Model 3 are available for the Chinese and European markets: Model 3 Performance and Model 3 Long-Range with Dual Motor AWD. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  January 4, the company announced the possibility of using Tesla configurator for the European market.

Over time, the company is increasing production volumes of Tesla Model 3, as well as other versions of its vehicles.  So it may well be that soon it will be possible to do without the reservation procedure. <br><br>  After starting work in Europe, Tesla immediately received 14,000 pre-orders from Europe.  This is not so much, but only two days have passed since the announcement, so this is an excellent result.  Most orders came from Norway, Germany and Switzerland. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b5a/5d5/bee/b5a5d5bee2b86f1f3deb89b09c66665f.jpg"><br><br>  Tesla has previously <a href="https://electrek.co/2018/12/12/tesla-imodel-3-volume-europe-port/">announced</a> that, starting in February of this year, it will ship about 3000 Tesla Model 3 per week for European buyers.  To fulfill its obligations, the company has already begun to negotiate with logistics companies from Europe.  Tesla representatives report that, thanks to the new market, more than 100 new jobs will be created additionally, and several million US dollars will be invested in the European economy. <br><br>  Now the company fulfills early promises to speed up the shipment of orders from its customers - the necessary volume has been achieved, so there should be no problems with Europe.  In the US, such problems were - the company simply could not cope with the fulfillment of its obligations and deliveries were constantly disrupted. <br><br>  In addition, there are other news from Tesla.  In particular, the company is working on a new version of its autopilot, called Autopilot Hardware 3. Perhaps it will be the previously announced "the most advanced version of the computer for autonomous machine control."  Currently, the Tesla system is capable of processing approximately 200 frames per second.  After replacing it with a new version, the autopilot performance will increase tenfold - up to 2,000 frames per second. <br><br>  The new version of the autopilot, perhaps, would be kept secret until the release of the system.  But information about the architecture of the system <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/01/04/tesla-leaks-hardware-3-self-driving-computer/">was</a> at its disposal "Tesla hacker" with the nickname verygreen.  Previously, he had already posted on the network information about all sorts of software updates electric company.  Now came the turn of the hardware. <br><br>  According to experts, the new autopilot will operate on the basis of the Samsung Exynos 7xxx SoC.  This is not the newest version from Samsung - it dates from October 2015.  The chip cores operate at 1.6 GHz.  The configuration also includes a MALI 250 MHz GPU and 533 MHz RAM.  The iron works with the Tesla PCI-Ex device, which is called the "TRIP" and serves as an accelerator for the autopilot neural network.  As far as can be judged, the new autopilot will have two or even four such devices. <br><br>  There is even a graphical visualization of the data processing autopilot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d7/c84/aed/8d7c84aed2c83483b644a8528d463e96.png"><br><br>  The data processing algorithm is somewhat similar to that used in Google's GoogLeNet.  Developers use this technology to recognize and index images.  It is not surprising, because the head of the Tesla division, which is working on the creation of an autopilot, is one of the creators of GoogLeNet. <br><br>  Hardware 3 will go into production in the first half of this year.  Similarly, there is a lot of work going on creating software for the new autopilot. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435246/</a></p>
