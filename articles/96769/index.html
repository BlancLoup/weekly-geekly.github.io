This is a fairly traditional established format, in which banks and designers try to surpass their colleagues / competitors in creativity, beauty, sophistication, fun, seriousness.  In short, this is a professional and meaningful show off.  Dress code, if you will, when entering a serious banking community. <br><br>  Designers and marketing / PR / advertising departments struggle every year to find new means of expression, but they are always limited to 50-60 sheets of expensive paper.  And suddenly it appears - augmented reality.  Why not?  - our good friends asked themselves - the guys from the agency <a href="http://bfive.ru/">B5</a> , who worked on the annual report of FIABANK.  Then they asked us the same question.  Thus the task was born: to supplement the annual report with augmented reality.  Combine the classics and modernity.  Make friends old and new.  How did this work go? <a name="habracut"></a>

      To begin with, it was necessary to determine the concept. <br><br><h5>  Option 1. "Live" infographics. </h5><br><br>  In any annual report a lot of information.  Figures, graphs, analysis.  As a rule, such dry statistical information is rather difficult to perceive.  Why not make her live?  - we thought.  Add animation, sound, visual comparative visuals. <br><br>  But thinking about the reader of the annual report, we came to the conclusion that the target audience is fed up with similar visuals.  They constantly watch (and make themselves) some presentations, figures, graphs, analysis.  Even if all this will be presented in the form of augmented reality.  Watch will be very boring. <br><br>  We celebrate. <br><br><h5>  Option 2. "Live" video. </h5><br><br>  FIABANK is traditionally strong with PR and a good team - i.e.  by people.  Because  the annual report reveals various areas of banking activity, then there is a separate person behind each area.  Let this person suddenly come out from the pages of the annual report, emotionally and first-person revealing his topic.  Why?  Cool.  Those.  this idea is already better, but something is missing. <br><br><h5>  Option 3. Video + 3D. </h5><br><br>  Any design is a company communication with the outside world.  Annual Report - Top Level Communication.  At the highest, so at the highest.  So refer to the target audience will be none other than the chairman of the bank.  Anatoly Parfiryevich Voloshin agreed to this role. <br><br>  But not just the same video to show?  Just a video, and so you can see.  So the video should be with the appropriate accompaniment.  We invented a virtual 3D scene for each video fragment on which Voloshin will perform. <br><br>  This is how the concept of a combination of video and 3D was born, which was approved. <br><br>  While preparing texts for the speech, we started for 3D. <br><br>  What are the 3D scenes?  In fact, there are several planes with textures: <br><ul><li>  Horizontal plane (‚Äúground‚Äù) on which the projecting (the plane with the video) and other vertical planes (‚Äúobjects‚Äù) are located. </li><li>  Vertical plane with video performance. </li><li>  Vertical plane-objects. </li><li>  Vertical plane with video background (sky and cloud). </li></ul><br>  Themes for the scenes were known and approved, it was necessary to visualize them. <br><br><h5>  Subject number 1.  Introduction. </h5><br><br>  Entry is always something generalizing.  Generalizing for FIABANK is FIABANK itself.  It was necessary to visualize it somehow.  It is clear that this is a logo and it is clear that it must be one of the buildings.  It was decided to use the image is not the head office, and the former hotel.  This is a very interesting project, which was abandoned, but, thanks to the efforts of FIABANK, it was resumed and completed.  Those.  the bank is directly related to the building.  In addition, several upper floors occupy the bank office. <br><br>  Search for a solution. <br><br><br>  Tiny podstavochka. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/afe/8f5/3b0/afe8f53b028590826ddce64e73b9534f.jpg" alt="Tiny podstavochka."><br><br>  A square stand. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b97/689/dc7/b97689dc7e963801ca984a0fbfe6cd73.jpg" alt="A square stand."><br><br>  Screen for additional information. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a3/4f7/1f8/6a34f71f8605a1af0b6848404568b28c.jpg" alt="Screen for additional information."><br><br>  Psedw√≥-tri-de. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1a2/3f1/c53/1a23f1c534b9e23984fa3476b99d1d16.jpg" alt="Psedw√≥-tri-de."><br><br>  Landscape with hotel.

Financing of construction sites. </h5><br><br>  Showing something concrete here was problematic.  There are many objects - there were no normal photos.  Therefore, the selection was made visuals: objects under construction, built objects, some vehicles. <br><br>  Search for a solution. <br><br><br>  Smalt and landscape on the wall. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/def/a69/d03/defa69d031231d6b6859d486b979bc79.jpg" alt="Smalt and landscape on the wall."><br><br>  Smalt, landscape on the wall, speaker, information board. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b4a/9bc/67e/b4a9bc67ecf633418dd9135fd8f530aa.jpg" alt="Smalt, landscape on the wall, speaker, information board."><br><br>  Corporate striped catwalk and falling Pizan towers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fbd/d79/344/fbdd7934495127c66f755e00d8982609.jpg" alt="Corporate striped catwalk and falling Pizan towers."><br><br>  And here is an information board. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/723/c91/bc8/723c91bc86e0dc2655e16ac37e35905a.jpg" alt="And here is an information board."><br><br>  Grass, asphalt, first line of new buildings. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd1/c0c/a21/bd1c0ca21a113f8d47f889a7176ffc84.jpg" alt="Grass, asphalt, first line of new buildings."><br><br>  Grass, asphalt, the first line of new buildings, the second line of objects under construction, equipment, firewall. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5bc/28e/212/5bc28e212b03a6a60892ec040b132840.jpg" alt="Grass, asphalt, the first line of new buildings, the second line of objects under construction, equipment, firewall."><br><br>  Around here will be a speaker. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b78/eb6/27c/b78eb627cd6789b0fa677e2593b51ee8.jpg" alt="Around here will be a speaker."><br><br>  Something like this will look out of the report. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c0a/be7/750/c0abe77506537a8aa828bc97dedbaa13.jpg" alt="Something like this will look out of the report."><br><br>  Information board and logo (which in the end will not). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c57/00c/da8/c5700cda8d81cad4c9837bab49b77ece.jpg" alt="Information board and logo (which in the end will not)."><br><br><h5>  Subject number 3.  FIABANK - the gold of Russia. </h5><br><br>  FIABANK has gold mining cartels in Yakutia.  From the point of view of photos - again nothing good.  Therefore, the scheme as in the previous topic: mine, mountains, some vehicles. <br><br>  Search for a solution. <br><br><br>  FIABANK staked the mine and drove some kind of combine. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a19/d09/53c/a19d0953c1243b2e760420135c05b9e4.jpg" alt="FIABANK staked the mine and drove some kind of combine."><br><br>  Information board shows what are the bars. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3d0/273/e3f/3d0273e3f1c900ee9486b573b7568033.jpg" alt="Information board shows what are the bars."><br><br>  This is what the mine looks like. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/242/9ee/c60/2429eec60003065e317ab81c0b56e413.jpg" alt="This is what the mine looks like."><br><br>  Priisk pokes out of the report. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/885/08e/2c1/88508e2c1a1869080b7949c00d93f32a.jpg" alt="Priisk pokes out of the report."><br><br>  Without a speaker will be boring. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7b4/161/7ad/7b41617ad32c3761280100ea8a5eba81.jpg" alt="Without a speaker will be boring."><br><br>  It is a pity that the information menu will not.

Not just shooting, but using the chroma key technology (chroma key).  In a nutshell.  The object is removed on a uniform background (in our case, green), then the video is processed in such a way that around the object being shot a uniform background is replaced with transparency. <br>  When filming there was one big complexity associated with time.  It was necessary at the same time to combine in time the studio, the operator, the head of the shooting / video editing specialist and 3D, the chairman of the bank.  The task, as it turned out, is incredibly difficult.  All very busy people.  Because  everything had to be shot for one take, it was decided to make 2 shots.  First: make-up / test.  The second: working.  At the first shooting we invited Igor Voloshin, who steadfastly spoke in front of the camera for 3 hours.  This material went into processing.  As a result, a beta version of augmented reality was obtained, with all the nuances tested. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/79b/444/ebc/79b444ebce468fe4eb8ebdca59a92307.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bda/f13/1e8/bdaf131e845808a4c956c71e89d13796.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/103/f4b/359/103f4b359556ac7d16506f2740c8c3e8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/507/c15/38c/507c1538cc67099ebfdb9f8dca239f71.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/367/d81/0e5/367d810e549cb08538d58014e1974a78.jpg"><br><br>  Two weeks later, the final shooting took place with the participation of Anatoly Parfiryevich Voloshin, which resulted in the final working version. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7b3/f79/052/7b3f79052bdb5161c1ec117165e076b1.jpg"><br><br>  Now it remains to draw a web interface and put the augmented reality on the network.  The interface consists of 4 pages, as many as those.  By default, the entry is loaded.  On the page we see the name of the topic, ourselves (view from the webcam), a turnaround of the corresponding page of the annual report and brief instructions.  Those who do not have an annual report can print the relevant pages with a marker by downloading the PDF file. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ddb/27a/9ca/ddb27a9ca88fdd03127b10931c8f046e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e9a/7b7/62a/e9a7b762ae23a771defb30f2b4849582.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4dc/48a/082/4dc48a08288f3a5b7efd0eb49b71faf8.jpg"><br>  And here is the video of augmented reality: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/N6be_jeceYU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjhRY8qs_-WKJELSR309n0K_Z7jfQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/K-CghKhtEsU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhyNUW-hl6ciVVwkMV8idRpovDUPw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-xJoEf8c9xA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjXo5Ya_bisdOAt3c4EBBycriUjfA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Alr24JIYZZU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjMxAS6gMUsZ3REbjeE1ZdCZdEfZQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><br><h5>  What difficulties faced. </h5><br><br>  Deadlines -&gt; multimarkernost. <br><br>  All annual reports are made and submitted at the last moment.  Therefore, the issue of providing information and coordinating the stages is very acute.  This also affected some technical issues in implementation.  For example, it was not possible to fully test the multimarker version of the interface.  Even when the report went to print, it turned out that the framework does not quite correctly handle 2 markers out of 4, i.e.  when used in multimarker mode, confuses them.  It was decided to separate the screens. <br><br>  Host speed <br><br>  Bank site is located on its own host.  The speed of the channel up is only 2 megabits.  The amount of data that the user pulls (engine, 3D model, textures, 2 video streams) requires a channel speed of at least 1 megabit.  Those.  theoretically, if the channel is free, then 2 users at the same time can see the augmented reality normally, but if a third appears, then the brakes will start.  In fact, the channel is constantly used, so even when 1 user starts watching, data loading is very slow.  The main weight is made up of textures and video.  The first ones cannot even be technically loaded from another host.  It is possible to organize uploading of video from another host, but security problems interfere there.  As a result, a separate domain was registered for the project, where you can see live what happened: <a href="http://www.fb-ar.ru/">www.fb-ar.ru</a> . <br><br>  What is the result?  As a result, the first (and probably the only) annual report using the augmented reality technology was obtained.  The scope of trend technology is constantly expanding. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96769/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96769/</a></p>
