  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to deploy SAP HANA: parse different methods</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  SAP HANA is a popular in-memory database engine, including Data Warehouse services and analytics, embedded middleware, an application server, a platform for setting up or developing new utilities.  By eliminating delays from traditional DBMSs with SAP HANA, you can greatly increase system performance, transaction processing (OLTP), and business intelligence (OLAP). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b3/f9c/5d5/7b3f9c5d5210aa5ed63d938a29c8b71a.png"><br><br>  You can deploy SAP HANA in Appliance and TDI modes (in terms of production environments).  For each option, the manufacturer has its own requirements.  In this post we will talk about the advantages and disadvantages of different options, as well as for clarity, about our real projects with SAP HANA. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  SAP HANA consists of 3 main components - a host, an instance and a system.

      <i>A host</i> is a server or operating environment for a SAP HANA database.  Its essential components are CPU, RAM, storage, network and operating system.  The host provides links to installation directories, data, logs, or directly to the storage system.  However, the storage system for an SAP HANA installation does not have to be located on the host.  If the system has multiple hosts, you will need either shared storage or one that is available on demand from all hosts. <br><br>  <i>Instance</i> - a set of SAP HANA system components installed on a single host.  The main components are the Index Server and Name Server.  The first one, which is also called the ‚Äúworking server‚Äù, processes requests, manages the actual data storages and database cores.  The Name Server stores information about the SAP HANA installation topology ‚Äî about where the components work and what data is on the server. <br><br>  <i>A system</i> is one or more instances with the same number.  In essence, this is a separate item that can be enabled, disabled, or copied (backed up).  The data is distributed in the memory of the various servers that make up the SAP HANA system. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/792/50a/93e/79250a93ec059560071160c551fd2615.png"></div><br>  The system can be configured as single-host (one instance on one host) or multi-host, distributed (several SAP HANA instances are distributed across several hosts, each instance has one instance).  In multihosting systems, each instance must have the same number.  The SAP HANA system is identified using a System ID (SID) ‚Äîa unique number consisting of three alphanumeric characters. <br><br><h2>  SAP HANA Virtualization </h2><br>  One of the main limitations of SAP HANA is the support of only one system - one instance with a unique server SID.  For more efficient use of hardware or reducing the number of servers in the data center, you can use virtualization.  Thus, other landscapes can coexist on the same server with systems that have smaller requirements (unproductive systems).  For backup HA / DR servers, virtualization can increase the speed of switching between productive and unproductive virtual machines. <br><br>  SAP HANA includes support for the VMWare ESX hypervisor.  This means that different SAP HANA systems ‚Äî SAP HANA installations with different SID numbers ‚Äî can coexist on a single host (common physical server) in different virtual machines.  Each virtual machine must run in a supported OS. <br><br>  For productive environments, SAP HANA virtualization has serious limitations: <br><br><ul><li>  Scale-out scaling is not supported - virtualization can be used only with Scale-Up systems, be it BwoH / DM / SoH or ‚Äúpure‚Äù SoH; <br></li><li>  Virtualization must be done within the rules established for the Appliance or TDI devices; <br></li><li>  in General Availability (GA) there can be only one virtual machine ‚Äî companies wishing to use virtualization with HANA production environments should participate in the Controlled Availability program with SAP. <br></li></ul><br>  In unproductive environments where there are no limitations listed above, virtualization can be used to optimize hardware utilization. <br><br><h2>  SAP HANA Topologies </h2><br>  Let's move on to deploying SAP HANA.  Two topologies are defined here. <br><br><ul><li>  Scale-up is one big server.  As the HANA base grows, the server grows as well: the number of CPUs and memory increases.  In solutions with High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR), backup or fault-tolerant servers must match the performance servers. <br></li><li>  Scale-out - the entire SAP HANA system is distributed across several identical servers.  The master server contains information for the Index Server and Name Server.  Slave servers do not contain this data - except for the server, which assumes the Master functions in the event of a failure at the primary server.  Index Servers manage the data segments that are assigned to them and also respond to requests.  Name servers know how data is shared between production servers.  If HANA grows, another node is simply added to the current server configuration.  In this topology, it is enough to have one backup node to ensure the security of the entire server. <br></li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cff/b5f/9b0/cffb5f9b05890c437fcb2d8beb2d7d3c.png"></div><br><h2>  SAP hardware requirements </h2><br>  SAP has mandatory requirements for HANA hardware.  They relate to productive environments - for non-prod enough minimum performance.  So, here are the requirements for production environments: <br><br><ul><li>  CPU Intel Xeon v5 (SkyLake) / 8880/90/94 v4 (Broadwell) <br></li><li>  128 GB RAM for BW applications with 2 CPUs, 256 GB with 4+ CPUs; <br></li></ul><br><h2>  Deploying SAP HANA in Appliance and TDI Modes </h2><br>  We now turn to practice and talk about how to implement SAP HANA in Appliance and TDI modes.  We use for this our SAP HANA platforms based on BullSequana S and Bullion S servers, which are certified by SAP for operation in these modes. <br><br>  A little help on the products.  BullSequana S based on Intel Xeon Scalable includes various models, up to 32 CPUs in one server.  The server is built on a modular design that provides scalability up to 32 CPUs and the same number of graphics processors.  RAM - from 64 GB to 48 TB.  Among the features of BullSequana S are corporate AI support for improved performance, accelerated data analytics, improved computation in memory, upgrades using virtualization and cloud technologies. <br><br>  Bullion S ships with Intel Xeon E7 v4 Family CPUs.  The maximum number of processors is 16. RAM is scaled from 128 GB to 24 TB.  The large number of RAS features provides high availability for critical infrastructures like SAP HANA.  Bullion S is suitable for mass data center consolidation, working with in-memory applications, migrating mainframes or legacy systems. <br><br><h2>  SAP HANA Appliance </h2><br>  Appliance is a pre-configured solution that includes a server, storage system and software package for turnkey implementation, with centralized support service and a specified level of performance.  Here HANA comes in the form of pre-configured hardware and software, fully integrated and certified.  The device in Appliance mode is ready for installation in the data center, and the operating system, SAP HANA, and (if necessary) additional VMWare instance are already configured and installed. <br><br>  The SAP certification determines the guaranteed level of performance, as well as the CPU model, RAM size and storage.  After certification, you cannot change the configuration without losing the warranty.  SAP has three options for scaling the HANA platform. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Scale-Up BWoH / DM / SoH</b> - vertical scaling, which is suitable for single systems (one SID).  Appliance devices are growing at 256/384 GB, starting with SAP HANA SPS 11. This ratio shows the maximum amount supported by a single CPU, and is common to the entire list of certified Appliance devices.  The BWoH / DM / SoH upscaled appliance is optimally suited for BW on HANA (BWoH), Data Mart (DM) and SAP Suite on HANA (SoH) applications. <br></li><li>  <b>Scale-Up SoH</b> is a lightweight version of the previous model, with fewer restrictions on the amount of RAM.  It is still a vertically scalable server, but the maximum RAM capacity for 2 processors is already 1,536 GB (up to version SPS11) and 3 TB (SPS12 +).  Only suitable for SoH. <br></li><li>  <b>Scale-Out</b> is a version with horizontal scaling, a system that supports multi-server configurations.  Horizontal scaling is optimal for BW and - with some limitations - for SoH. <br></li></ul><br>  In the BullSequana S and Bullion S servers, vertical scaling is essential because it has fewer operational limitations and requires less administration.  For appliance mode, there is a large line of different devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u3/ea/_t/u3ea_tccymrnp5lg2zped_umore.png"><br>  <i>BullSequana S for SAP HANA Solutions in Appliance Mode</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ta/y3/wj/tay3wjtkmhwnkiidicwbcdhheqo.png"><br>  * Optional E7-8890 / 94v4 <br>  <i>Bullion S Solutions for SAP HANA in Appliance Mode</i> <br><br>  All Bull solutions in Appliance Mode since SAP HANA SPS 12 are certified.  The equipment is installed in a standard 19-inch rack 42U, with two power sources - internal PDU.  Certification SAP have servers: <br><br><ul><li>  BullSequana S with Intel Xeon Skylake 8176, 8176M, 8180, 8180M (processors with the letter ‚ÄúM‚Äù support work with memory modules of 128 GB each).  In terms of price and quality, the options with the Intel 8176 look best. <br></li><li>  Bullion S with Intel Xeon E7-8880 v4, 8890 and 8894. <br></li></ul><br>  Storage connects to the server directly through the FC ports, so SAN switches are not needed here.  They can be useful for accessing systems connected to a LAN or SAN. <br><br>  Here is an example of the configuration of the EMC Unity 450F storage system in our setup: <br><br><ul><li>  Height: 5U (DPE 3U (25x2.5 "HDD / SSD) + DAE 2U (25x2.5" HDD / SSD)) <br></li><li>  Controllers: 2 <br></li><li>  Drives: from 6 to 250 SAS SSD, from 600 GB to 15.36 TB each <br></li><li>  RAID: level 5 (8 + 1), 4 RAID groups <br></li><li>  Interface: 4 FC per controller, 8 or 16 Gbps each <br></li><li>  Software: Unisphere Block Suite <br></li></ul><br>  The appliance is a reliable deployment option, but it has a big drawback: <i>there is little freedom in configuring hardware</i> .  In addition, this option may require changes in the processes of the IT department. <br><br><h2>  SAP HANA TDI </h2><br>  An alternative to an Appliance is TDI (Tailored Data Center Integration) mode, in which you can select specific manufacturers and infrastructure components depending on the customer‚Äôs wishes, taking into account the tasks performed and the workload.  For example, a SAN can be reused in a data center, with some drives assigned to a HANA installation. <br><br>  Compared to the appliance, in the TDI mode, the user is given much greater freedom in fulfilling the requirements.  This greatly simplifies the integration of HANA in the data center - you can build your own customized infrastructure.  For example, vary the type and number of processors depending on the load. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c51/3a7/dec/c513a7dec92c1ad5ea09aaa08043eb5a.png"></div><br>  For capacity calculations, it is recommended to use SAP Quick Sizer, a simple tool that provides CPU and memory requirements for different workloads in SAP HANA.  You can then contact SAP Active Global Support to plan your IT landscape.  After that, the hardware partner SAP HANA converts the results of the calculations into different possible system configurations - both on the top and on the simpler hardware.  In TDI mode, it is <i>permissible</i> for servers to <i>use Intel E7 CPUs, including Intel Broadwell E7 and Skylake-SP (Platinum, Gold, Silver with 8 or more cores per processor), as well as IBM Power8</i> / 9. <br><br>  Servers are shipped without storage, switches and racks, but hardware requirements remain the same as in Appliance mode ‚Äî the same single nodes, solutions with vertical or horizontal scaling.  SAP requires that <i>only certified servers, storage systems and switches are used</i> , but this is not a problem - for most manufacturers, almost all equipment is certified. <br><br>  <i>Performance testing should be performed using the Hardware Configuration Check Tool (HWCCT) tests</i> , which allow you to verify compliance with certain SAP KPIs.  And there is a non-hardware requirement: <i>HANA, OS, and hypervisor (optional) must be installed by specialists with SAP certification</i> .  Only systems where all the listed rules are observed can receive SAP support related to performance. <br><br>  The line of BullSequana S servers in TDI mode is similar to the line in Appliance mode, but without storage systems, switches and racks.  You can install any storage system from the list of certified SAP - VNX, XtremIO, NetApp, and others.  For example, if the VNX5400 meets the SAP HANA performance requirements, you can connect a Dell EMC Unity 450F storage system as part of a TDI configuration.  If necessary, FC adapters (1 or 10 Gb / s) are installed, as well as Ethernet switches. <br><br>  Now, so that you more clearly presented the described modes, we will tell about several of our real-life cases. <br><br><h2>  Appliance + TDI: HANA for online store </h2><br>  Online store Mall.cz, part of the Mall Group, was founded in 2000.  It has branches in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia and Romania.  This is the largest online store in the country, selling up to 75 thousand products a day, its revenue in 2017 amounted to about 280 million euros. <br><br>  A data center infrastructure upgrade was required due to the migration to SAP HANA.  Estimated sizing was 2x6 TB for the prod environment and 6 TB for the test / dev environment.  At the same time, a disaster recovery solution was required for the SAP HANA production environment in an active-active cluster. <br><br>  At the time of the announcement of the tender, the customer had a system under SAP on the basis of standard rack and blade servers.  Two data centers, located at a distance of about 10 km from each other, were equipped with different storage systems - IBM SVC, HP and Dell.  Key systems worked in disaster recovery mode. <br><br>  First, the customer requested a certified solution in Appliance mode for SAP HANA for all systems (Production and test / dev environments) with growth to 12 TB.  But due to budget constraints, other options began to be considered - for example, a larger number of CPUs with smaller RAM modules (64 GB modules instead of 128 GB modules).  In addition, joint storage for Production and test / dev environments was considered to optimize the price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f62/2de/503/f622de5033e2842e2d60c39744cd8767.png"><br><br>  Converged to 4 CPUs and 6 TB of RAM for the Production environment, with the possibility of growth.  For test / dev environments in TDI mode, they decided to do with less expensive CPUs - 8 CPUs and 6 TB of RAM were obtained.  Due to more customer-requested features ‚Äî replication, backup, production and test / dev shared environments on the second site ‚Äî instead of internal drives, the DellEMC Unity storage system was used in full-flash configuration.  In addition, the customer requested a disaster recovery solution based on the HANA System Replication (HSR) with a quorum node on a third site. <br><br>  The final configuration for the Prod environment consisted of a BullSequana S400 server on an Intel Xeon P8176M (28 core, 2.10 GHz, 165 W) and with 6 TB of RAM.  Storage - Unity 450F 10x 3.84 TB.  For disaster recovery for the Prod environment, they used the BullSequana S400 on Intel Xeon P8176M (28 cores, 2.10 GHz, 165 W) with 6 TB of RAM.  For the test / dev environment, we took the BullSequana S800 server with Intel Xeon P8153 (16 cores, 2.00 GHz, 125 W) and 6 TB of RAM plus Unity 450F 15x 3.84 TB of storage.  As a quorum, application servers (VxRail Solution) and backup solutions (DataDomain), our experts installed and configured DellEMC servers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/224/2d4/f33/2242d4f331aed7701aeea01394c54306.png"><br>  <i>The equipment is ready for a future upgrade.</i>  <i>The customer expects HANA sizing growth in 2019, and he will only have to install new modules in the racks.</i> <br><br><h2>  Appliance: HANA for a major tourism integrator </h2><br>  This time, our client has become a major IT service provider engaged in the development of technological solutions for travel companies.  The customer launched an ambitious SAP HANA project to introduce a new billing system.  A solution was required in Appliance mode with 8 TB of RAM for Production and PreProd environments.  In accordance with the recommendations of SAP, the customer chose the option with vertical scaling. <br><br>  The key challenge was the implementation of hardware infrastructure based on Appliance-certified devices for SAP HANA.  Priority criteria were cost effectiveness, high performance, scalability and high data availability. <br><br>  We proposed and implemented a solution certified by SAP, which includes two Bullion S16 servers - for Prod and PreProd environments.  The equipment runs on Intel Xeon E7-v4 8890 processors (24 cores, 2.20 GHz, 165 W) and is equipped with 16 TB of RAM.  For BW and Dev / Test environments, we installed nine Bullion S4 servers (22 cores, 2.20 GHz, 150 W) with 4 TB of RAM each.  Hybrid EMC Unity was used as storage. <br><br>  This solution provides scaling support for all device elements ‚Äî for example, up to 16 sockets with an Intel Xeon E7-v4 CPU.  Administration in this configuration is simplified ‚Äî in particular, to reconfigure or split the server into partitions. <br><br><h2>  Appliance + TDI: HANA for metallurgists </h2><br>  MMC Norilsk Nickel, one of the largest producers of nickel and palladium, decided to upgrade its SAP HANA hardware platform to support business-critical business applications and projects.  The expansion of the existing landscape in terms of computing power was required.  One of the main conditions put forward by the customer was the high availability of the platform - despite the hardware limitations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f31/ac1/8e3/f31ac18e31001a28dc55c7aa6c68b60a.png"><br><br>  For production environments, we used a Bullion S8 server and storage in the SAP HANA Appliance mode.  For HA and test / dev, the platform was deployed in TDI mode.  Used one server Bull Bullion S8, two Bull Bullion S6 and hybrid storage.  This combination made it possible to significantly increase the speed of the SAP landscape applications, increase the amount of computing power and storage resources and minimize operating costs.  It is important that the client has the opportunity to scale up to 16 CPU. <br><br><h2>  Welcome to the SAP Forum </h2><br>  In this post we covered the deployment of SAP HANA in various ways, tried to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the options available.  If you have any questions on the implementation of SAP HANA, we will be happy to answer them in the comments. <br><br>  All those who are interested in Bull solutions and their implementation capabilities under SAP HANA are welcome to the largest SAP event of the year: the SAP Forum 2019 will take place in Moscow on April 17. We are waiting for you at our stand in the IoT zone: we will tell you a lot of interesting things and also raffle many prizes. <br><br>  See you at the forum! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446858/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446858/</a></p>
