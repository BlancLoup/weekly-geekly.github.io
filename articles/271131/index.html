    <h3>  Introduction </h3><br>  The argument about the possibility of using the GOTO operator in programs has been going on for a very long time (Dijkstra‚Äôs official recognition of the harm of the GOTO operator, published in 1968 [2]) was recognized as its beginning.  In three years we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of this dispute.  This is a good reason to finally "dot the i's" and stop the argument. <br><br>  The quote in the epigraph was not chosen by chance.  It accurately reflects the current situation in the GOTO dispute.  In our case, the ‚Äúroom behind the closed door‚Äù is the formulation of the problem that everyone understands.  So far, unfortunately, such a statement of the problem has not been voiced, therefore disputes do not fade.  The opposing sides argue, though about similar, but still about different things, therefore, they cannot find a compromise. <br><br>  Let's take a neutral side in this dispute, and let's deal with everything impartially.  Consider the arguments of "opponents" and "defenders" of the operator GOTO and decide "which of them is right and who is to blame." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Why are disputes going on </h3><br>  As already noted above, disputes about the possibility of using the GOTO operator in programs are conducted because of the lack of a clear statement of the problem.  Roughly speaking, one of the parties proves that the tree is floating, and the other that the brick is sinking.  Naturally, with such a statement, each of the parties is sure that they are right and will always defend it. <br><br>  Opponents GOTO rely on the rules of good form.  It is here that the key to the "closed door" is hidden, since  There are at least three good tone rules: ‚Äúgood tone in structuring,‚Äù ‚Äúgood tone in speed,‚Äù and ‚Äúgood tone in compactness,‚Äù but GOTO opponents take into account only one of them. <br><br>  GOTO advocates rely on customer requirements, where, among others, items related to speed and compactness of the program are not uncommon.  With such a statement, the rule of good tone cannot be avoided - you have to look for a compromise solution.  As a result of such a solution, the GOTO operator sometimes appears in the program. <br><br>  In this case, it is difficult to distinguish a brick from a log, since  Recently, when developing programs, speed and compactness have received less and less attention.  But this is not a reason for their complete disregard, since  for any demand should be your offer. <br><br>  The voiced point of view is very superficial, since  does not take into account the details of the dispute.  To formulate an objective statement of the problem, it is necessary to consider the arguments and counter arguments of each of the parties.  This is what we will do now.  The bold letters <b>H</b> are the arguments of the GOTO defenders, and the bold letters <b>P</b> are the arguments of the opponents of the GOTO. <br><br><h3>  The arguments of the "opponents" GOTO </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">1. Using GOTO - bad form.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Z:</b> This is not an argumentative statement, so there‚Äôs no point in arguing here. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">2. The worst tone - back with a label back.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Z:</b> Indeed, GOTO cannot be used this way, just as it cannot be used to go to another block of the field of view - you can either stay in the current or go out of it.  If you follow these two rules, you can use GOTO. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">3. GOTO - redundant operator.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">It can easily be replaced by cycles and conditions.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Z:</b> For that matter, almost all operators can be thrown out of the language. <br><br>  From the point of view of structured programming, all statements can be thrown out of the language altogether, leaving only while and the assignment operator.  [1] In this case, the program will be at least voluminous, but understandable.  If in practice attention was paid only to the structure of the program, then such a step would be reasonable, but in real problems there are also requirements for speed and compactness, and this cannot be achieved with a single operator. <br><br>  GOTO is not a sign of the curvature of the code, but of the curvature of languages ‚Äã‚Äãin which sometimes without it (C, C ++, C #, Pascal, Java, etc) and the curvature of profanation called ‚Äústructural programming‚Äù with its so-called  ‚ÄúCycles with preconditions‚Äù, ‚Äúcycles with postconditions‚Äù and ‚Äúramifications‚Äù, which are not elementary constructions, but typical patterns in which the task is not always conveniently placed. <br><br>  The disadvantage is that if the task does not fall into these patterns ideally, then redundant code appears, which in some cases does not meet the requirements of compactness and speed. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">4. Wirth and Dijkstra say that GOTO is bad.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">[2, 3]</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Z:</b> Authoritative opinions are worthy of attention, but what the authorities say is not the ultimate truth.  It is not without reason that the phrase ‚ÄúIf a respected scientist says that‚Äú it is possible to do it ‚Äù, then he is most likely right, and if he says that‚Äú it is impossible to do it, ‚Äùthen most likely is not right. <br><br>  There are also such authorities that speak in favor of GOTO, for example, Donald Knut [4], Fredrik Brooks.  [5] But in solving the problem it is more expedient to rely not on the opinion of authorities, but on common sense. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">5. GOTO cancels many of the compiler's optimization capabilities of control structures, which makes the code slower and more complex.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">[2]</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Z:</b> This problem is in no way related to GOTO, because  optimization is performed at the level of machine codes.  Yes, GOTO inserts a jump instruction into machine code that prevents code optimization, but the same instructions insert both a conditional statement and a loop statement. <br></div></div><br><h3>  The arguments of the "defenders" GOTO </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">1. Group of mutually exclusive conditions.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Sample code ...</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code class="hljs vbscript"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span>(objectA.nValue == objectB.nValue) { ... <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">goto</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">END</span></span>; } <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span>(objectC.nValue == objectD.nValue) { ... <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">goto</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">END</span></span>; } <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span>(objectE.nValue == objectF.nValue) { ... <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">goto</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">END</span></span>; } <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">END</span></span>: ...</code> </pre> </td><td><pre> <code class="hljs objectivec"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span>(objectA.nValue == objectB.nValue) { } <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">else</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span>(objectC.nValue == objectD.nValue) { } <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">else</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span>(objectE.nValue == objectF.nValue) { } ‚Ä¶</code> </pre></td></tr></tbody></table><br></div></div><br>  <b>P:</b> In this case, GOTO does not spoil the structure of the program, but in such a construction there is no practical need, since  The same can be done through if / else. <br><br>  <b>Z: It</b> is possible to replace the given code with if / else only if no additional operations are performed before completion. <br><br>  <b>P:</b> Additional operations can be carried out in a separate function and called it in each branch. <br><br>  <b>Z:</b> Taking out additional operations into a separate function will reduce the program speed, and in some cases this is unacceptable. <br><br>  <b>P:</b> A separate function can be arranged in the form of an inline-function, then it will not affect the speed in any way. <br><br>  <b>Z:</b> But then the program will take up more memory.  And this, in some cases, may also contradict the task. <br><br>  As a result of this dispute, completion procedures and a structural exception handling mechanism were introduced in many languages.  These tools run a little slower than GOTO, but are more visual, so for most of the tasks they are quite enough.  But, again, there are tasks where it is critical and this is ‚Äúa bit‚Äù - in them the use of GOTO seems expedient. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">2. The principle of universal causality - if somewhere there is a GOTO, then it is needed there.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The new language does not appear from the bay-bash.  The developers of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãhave a difficult task - to satisfy all the requests of programmers, and take into account generally accepted paradigms.  It is absurd to assume that a concept will be implemented in the language that no one needs.  If we consider C as an example, then in general all questions disappear, since  When analyzing the language, it seems that for each new operator introduced into the language, the developers had to pay $ 5000 out of their pocket ... and the GOTO operator is there. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">3.

Using GOTO in programs is permissible, but it is not necessary to rush from one extreme to the other. <br></div></div><br><h3>  Let's sum up </h3><br>  <strike>Crowds of religious fanatics of a</strike> team of qualified programmers often abandon the GOTO operator, even when its use is expedient from the point of view of program efficiency and visibility. <br><br>  Bad pitch in programming?  If only the ‚Äústructuring tone‚Äù is taken into account, then yes.  But there is still a "tone of speed" and "tone of compactness," so you need to find a compromise between them.  [6] Programmers "working in the sandbox", as a rule, solve problems that do not have to think about saving resources, hence the misunderstanding. <br><br>  Ignoring the ‚Äústructuring tone‚Äù is also impossible, since  In any case, the program will have to be finalized, and if there is an intricate structure in it, then unnecessary costs will arise.  As with any other practical solution, the best compromise is the use of GOTO, but with the following reservations: <br><br><ol><li>  You can only go forward. </li><li>  It‚Äôs absolutely impossible to enter the blocks (either stay or go out). </li></ol><br>  Most likely, stories about the harmfulness of the GOTO operator are invented for novice programmers, so that they do not use it during training.  Students studying structural programming and language constructions in universities know that GOTO is evil.  But when a specific task arises, it is necessary to proceed from it, and not from the templates provided by the programming language.  It rarely happens that a concrete pattern corresponds to a practical task.  GOTO just helps to adapt existing templates to the task being solved. <br><br><h3>  Thanks </h3><br>  I am grateful to the people who shared with me the information and their thoughts about the justification for using the GOTO operator in the programs.  Without your help, the article would express the one-sided opinion of a single person, i.e.  me.  Together with you, we were able to support a constructive dispute, which resulted in a clear answer to the topic of concern to a large number of programmers. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Who are these people?</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Here they are:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I thank Dmitry Leonov for creating the site bugtraq.ru and for the fact that he managed to rally a large number of high-class specialists in his forum.
