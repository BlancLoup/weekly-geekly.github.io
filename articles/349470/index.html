  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Virtual Reality Arguments</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I have been taking part in the launch of several games in virtual reality, which graduates of our educational program have managed at the VSBI game projects.  Under the cat gathered his thoughts on the problems that technology is facing now, how they decide whether there are prospects for virtual reality and games for various VR platforms in particular.  I would be very happy to discuss in the comments what you think about these very perspectives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jm/ym/fz/jmymfzz9yo7zih93u6gma_ww3is.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, in the field of VR-games, the consumer market is still in the process of formation.  Such giants as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Samsung, Sony also form it.  And hundreds of companies of different sizes, including indie game development teams and IT startups.  It's good. <br><br>  What we get in numbers.  Different analytical agencies give different numbers, but for example, according to CCS Insight, VR and AR, the market grew by 47% and amounted to $ 1.6 billion in 2017, compared with the previous year.  But what data on sales of VR-devices is in the public domain:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3q/gc/--/3qgc--dtm-6oik4qvy9z5eiia0w.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>This statistics, broken down by year.</i>  <i>Has anyone seen more relevant statistics, showing how much is now specifically in the hands of the players of each type of helmet in the world?</i> <br><br>  The numbers show controversial.  On the one hand, the market is growing, on the other hand, sales of wives are declining, and under Sony you can hardly make games for indie teams.  This year there is a new wive and a push for its sales, I hope, will pump this part of the market. <br><br>  <b>What problems are there in the market now? Will they be solved?</b> <br><br>  <b>Cost</b>  Helmets are too expensive.  Computer to VR, even more expensive.  With this problem, everything is fine, the prices are gradually creeping down, computers are becoming more powerful every year, and the fact that today is the top grade and top price, in 3-4 years it is already budget and most can afford. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ol/vn/cd/olvncdzoyhjavuxdsrcqkea1v7g.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Availability killer app</b> .  The way Space Invadors was for arcade machines, the way Zelda was for the Nintendo switch.  So far there is no such thing for virtual reality.  We are waiting for the supergame, for which they will buy VR-helmets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s6/sz/t9/s6szt9wm_vwc4ynzivodkghmqvq.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Wires</b> .  Wires interfere.  Fortunately, the decision is near.  In 2018, the VR-helmet HTC Vive should acquire a wireless module connecting to a signal source.  A prototype demonstration was held by Intel at Computex 2017 in Taipei.  The WiGig protocol (Intel Wireless Gigabit, IEEE 802.11ad) from this company will be used to connect the helmet and the computer using the 60 GHz frequency band and provides connection at speeds up to 7 Gbit / s.  In addition, to avoid drawdowns in the frame rate, the wireless version of the HTC Vive will use a special protocol and DisplayLink XR codec.  Unlike the HTC Vive, the Oculus goes the other way.  At the Oculus Connect conference in October 2017, Facebook introduced the completely independent Oculus Go virtual reality helmet that does not require a connection to either a computer or a smartphone.  Sales of the helmet should begin in the fall of 2018, however, you need to understand that this is a compromise solution.  Thus, it can be seen how companies are selected from different edges to the very device that will eventually be able to combine all the developments to which the community has been going for years and in the near future to present a helmet free from most of the shortcomings and problems of modern models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ds/ha/x7/dshax7jb6b_cgyn1pzfa6tujfo8.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>The depth of immersion and the length of the game session</b> .  In VR, you can‚Äôt play all night.  This long-term problem will be solved for years, if not decades, in the process of equipment evolution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1i/ki/k0/1ikik0n9d0z5mmprbajeiwjvvwu.jpeg"><br><br>  And there are several problems that also have to be solved: resolution, weight, cross-platform, the possibility of free-to-play monetization, etc. <br><br>  Total it turns out that a lot of problems.  Problems are solved, but slowly.  In this regard, there are no golden mountains in the games of virtual reality, it can be seen with the naked eye from the statistics of sold helmets.  But the market is new, the market is interesting, I personally see it as a good thing to create VR games.  Do not immediately wait for the golden mountains, but slowly and truly develop the market along with other technology enthusiasts in order to make money in the future. <br><br>  Probably VR somewhere here: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2t/n-/1j/2tn-1johwujxuauf2dsbgssvlkc.png"><br><br>  What do you think? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/349470/">https://habr.com/ru/post/349470/</a></p>
