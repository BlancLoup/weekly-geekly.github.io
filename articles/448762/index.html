  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Riot on Picaba. Users massively go to Reddit</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you are not in the know, drama has been raging on <a href="http://pikabu.ru/">Picaba</a> for several days in a row.  Users have rebelled against the policy of moderation of the resource in relation to the "strawberry" content.  In protest, they spread rot to the administration of the service and massively go to other resources, including <a href="http://reddit.com/">Reddit</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If someone still does not know, Peekaboo is the Russian equivalent of Reddit.  Some time ago, the site administrator and his moderators began to introduce policies that were not entirely clear to active users regarding the site in general and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work">NSFW content</a> in particular. <br><br>  In the past 2 years, the situation began to heat up.  Moderators began to delete even photos of people in swimsuits and label them as porn.  Then the same thing happened with ascii arts and, let's say, with objects like something like a penis or vagina. <br><br>  In response to this, users created an <a href="https://pikabu.ru/%40Uspeli">‚Äúuspeli‚Äù</a> account and began to mention it in themes with NSFW content.  The mechanic is this: after mentioning ‚Äúuspeli‚Äù, he managed to save the controversial content in his Telegram for all the suffering before they sawed it out.  It was necessary only to call him under pikcha. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      For a very long time, ‚Äúuspeli‚Äù and moderation of the site existed in relative harmony: the moderators removed the content prohibited by the rules, and curious users could see it from ‚Äúuspeli‚Äù.  Thus, Picaba seemed to relieve himself of the burden of responsibility for such content. <br><br>  But suddenly the moderators decided to fight this balance and, without warning anyone, the parser was taught to automatically call the moderator when the user ‚Äúuspeli‚Äù was mentioned. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Spoiler</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dv/pz/ye/dvpzye1-m3qzvsgxjtkgihwhfmi.png"><br></div></div><br>  When this became known, in the TG channel, where the strawberry content merged, a call appeared to begin to troll the administration by mentioning the user ‚Äúuspeli‚Äù.  As a result, this account was banned altogether, and users were banned from mentioning ‚Äúuspeli‚Äù and banned for it, arguing as follows: ‚Äúabuse of the mod call command‚Äù.  <b>But no one knew that the mention of this account previously caused more and moderators.</b>  This was the detonator of the riot, which has been going on for several days. <br><br>  Picabu has always been a platform through which various social problems have been solved.  Admins Picaba could easily drown the discontented, twist their ratings, rivet bots that would drown their posts.  Just banning permanently and hard to clean up all the posts - just shut up, as it easily makes ‚Äúyaplakal‚Äù.  But this was not done and it says a lot.  There are no riots on the ‚Äúyaplakal‚Äù.  And on Picaba there.  Because you want to "rebel" - "rebel" is not prohibited, your rebellion post will not be removed, you will not be banned.  For flood banned for rebellion - no.  Therefore, when the administration of the resource began to take measures in relation to the ‚Äústrawberry‚Äù content and, rather awkwardly and aggressively towards the users, they began to be outraged.  Tolerance to riots spawned a riot when users were faced with incomprehensible behavior of modders on the site where these riots were actually staged. <br><br>  As a result, the uprising generated a mass exodus of active users to Reddit.  A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pikabu/">sub-trust</a> has already been created <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pikabu/">there</a> , in which there are already more than 30 thousand ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù.  Also created a site <br>  <a href="http://uspeli.ml/">uspeli.ml</a> , functionally similar to Picaba.  Attack has undergone and official app applications in Google Play.  For several days, his rating was lowered to 2.5 points. <br><br>  What can I say?  The site administration and moderators made a fatal error and now it is unclear how this situation will end. <br><br><h3>  Links </h3><br>  <a href="https://pikabu.ru/tag/Uspeli">Tag, which can follow the posts regarding the riot</a> <br>  <a href="https://pikabu.ru/story/_6650873">Brief chronology of the riot</a> <br>  <a href="https://pikabu.ru/story/_6651212">Administration post</a> <br>  <a href="https://pikabu.ru/story/_6652199">Good post about what's going on</a> <br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.pikabu.android%26hl%3Dru">Link to Android for Android</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448762/">https://habr.com/ru/post/448762/</a></p>
