    <h2>  Requirements </h2><br>  PHP 4.3.10 or higher.  On PHP 5 also difficulties are not noticed.  Also in the near future, the developers promise special features specifically for PHP 5. <br>  MySQL 4.1.x or later. <br>  Straight arms <br><br><h2>  Read more </h2><br>  Still, dig a little deeper to make it even clearer. <br><br><h3>  Ajax </h3><br>  MODx initially has built-in libraries Scriptaculous, Prototype, Mootools.  Ajax is actively used in the admin part.  The list of documents initially shows only the necessary items (parent documents), and then additional (child) ones are loaded if necessary.  The list is also dynamically updated during editing, creating, deleting, publishing documents. <br><br><h3>  SEO </h3><br>  Great keyword management engine.  There is a general manageable list of keywords that are then simply selected in each document.  In this case, the engine itself registers everything on the page, without any additions to the code. <br><br><h3>  CNC </h3><br>  No additional add-ons are needed.  You simply turn on the use of CNC and enjoy.  By default, the document number (ID) is used unless you specify a special alias.  For English-language articles, you can use the ability to automatically create an alias for the title. <br><br>  Among other things, MODx allows you to specify the necessary extension for pages (for example <strong>.html</strong> ). <br><br><h3>  Users, Groups, and Documents </h3><br>  The developers have divided all users into Web users (who use the site) and managers (who manage the site).  The rights of managers are defined by roles and easily managed. <br><br>  Each user can belong to one or several groups. <br><br>  Each document can be defined in a group of documents (one or more). <br><br>  For each group of users, you can define one or more groups of documents. <br><br>  Thus, it is possible to determine who can use what documents and what to do with them.  Very flexible! <br><br><h3>  Documents </h3><br>  Documents can be not only in HTML format, but also css, javasript, xml and any other that can be defined by the corresponding type (Content-Type).  Then these documents can be converted to another desired format.  So you can make a library that stores all the books in XML format, and gives visitors in any convenient form (doc, pdf, txt, rtf, etc.).  In the MODx sites, you can see that the css and javasript files also make separate documents so that they can be conveniently managed. <br><br>  A separate document type is a link that can point to both external pages and an internal document. <br><br><h3>  Document tree </h3><br>  All documents are lined up in a common tree.  Thanks to Ajax, it loads only visible documents, and when opening a branch, it loads additional documents quickly.  The tree shows the type of document, whether it is published or not, whether it is displayed in the menu.  Rights key brings up a context menu.  Deleted documents are shown crossed out, and finally deleted by a special button. <br><br><h3>  Document Parameters </h3><br>  This is just a great thing!  Have you ever had a thought in your head that ‚Äúoh, would you add some author's note for the article, so that each article has its own‚Äù?  MODx offers the perfect option.  You can add any number of parameters / widgets to documents (and, if absolutely frankly, to templates).  And not just a text field, but a very diverse list of options: a text line, a field with a visual editor, a drop-down list, an attachment file, a link, etc. <br><br>  Want to add value to your documents?  Easily! <br><br><h3>  Templates </h3><br>  Patterns largely determine the ease of development.  Who tried to change the standard output of articles in Joomla and not only - will understand.  MODx stores all templates in one place and offers a management tool.  Convenient and simple template language makes work easy and fast. <br>  For example: <br><blockquote>  [(site_name)] |  [* pagetitle *] </blockquote><br><br>  All clear, right? <br><br>  For various extensions, there are small templates that are also easily managed. <br><br><h3>  Standard tools </h3><br>  The standard package offers several very flexible extensions: <br><br>  <strong>Ditto</strong> - is responsible for the formation of various lists of pages, with pagination.  Allows you to display as a normal list of documents in the form of links, and sorted by a given keyword (from the tag cloud).  Allows you to use any additional parameters and display the name of the author of the article, the number of comments, the cost of goods, etc. <br><br>  <strong>Wayfinder</strong> - a tool for organizing the menu.  Gives the opportunity to organize as a simple menu, as a multi-level and drop-down.  Easy to change. <br><br>  <strong>eForm</strong> - manages the work of forms in MODx.  Allows you to organize any shape and processing for it.  It can simply send you the entered information by e-mail or process it to get some result (create a new document with the filled information). <br><br>  <strong>Jot</strong> is a mechanism for collecting user comments. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  MODx is still not old enough for the first version, but this is already a serious adult tool.  It allows you to quickly create complex sites and almost instantly simple. <br><br><h3>  Little tar </h3><br>  It is worth mentioning some of the negative aspects of MODx that have been noticed. <br><ol><li>  Productivity decreases with an increase in the number of documents.  This becomes very obvious when there are about 5000 documents. Everything starts to work for a very long time, despite Ajax. </li><li>  Few serious ready-made solutions.  They actively appear of course, but so far the fact remains.  There is still no solution for an online store.  Recently there was one solution, but for now it is not possible to use it. </li><li>  Rakes with the Russian language periodically appear.  That with coding problems, some extensions do not support.  The same AjaxSearch (search) is very significant does not want to work. <br>  But the work on these moments is actively going, and straight arms always come to the rescue.  We wish MODx to solve all the bad moments, and the good ones to do even more. </li></ol><br><br>  <a href="http://www.modx-cms.ru/50.html">A source</a> <br><br><h2>  Links </h2><br>  <a href="http://modxcms.com/">MODx official website</a> <br>  <a href="http://opensourcecms.com/index.php%3Foption%3Dcontent%26task%3Dview%26id%3D2101%26Itemid%3D159">Demo</a> <br><br>  Bright working example: <a href="http://deforum.ru/">DeForum</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13660/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13660/</a></p>
