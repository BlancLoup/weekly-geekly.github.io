    <a name="habracut"></a>  Following the results of the last III quarter of the 2007 fiscal year, sales of Adobe products in Russia grew by 260%, while the company's similar indicator throughout the world grew by about 40%.  Absolute sales figures, as well as the share of Russia in the general sales pie of Adobe, the company does not disclose. <br><br>  Mr. Cherkashin told CNews that Russia, the CIS countries and Eastern Europe are priority markets for the company.  Considering that currently Adobe‚Äôs main sales are focused in Moscow, the company is planning an active expansion to the regions of Russia.  In the CIS, Adobe will pay attention primarily to Ukraine and Kazakhstan.  Currently, the localization of products into Russian has been conducted for a relatively long time (Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Reader and Creative Suite are ready), and localization into Ukrainian has begun (Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator are ready).  In the near future, the company plans to localize several more of its key products to these languages. <br><br>  An indication that Russia is one of the highest-priority markets for Adobe is also the fact that the company's representative office in Russia, which since its foundation has grown from one to six employees, plans to expand actively (in 2009, about 30 employees should work in the representative office ) and even got its development plan.  The main tasks from 2008 to 2011.  There will be an active fight against piracy - in particular, cooperation with the BSA - and a number of additional measures that ultimately, according to Adobe‚Äôs plans, should reduce the level of piracy of the company's products to about 70% (now it is about 84%). <br><br>  Also, the priorities for Adobe are cooperation with government and educational institutions and active work with both retail and OEM.  As for retail, in the period from 2009 to 2011.  Adobe hopes to get about 1 million customers in Russia.  The already mentioned regional expansion will also be important. <br><br>  In addition, Adobe plans to expand cooperation with individual industries.  This, above all, is about telecom, finance, oil and gas.  The plans also - the development of consulting consulting Adobe. <br><br>  In terms of products, Adobe plans to actively develop, in particular, the online direction, will pay increasing attention to mobile users.  It is in Russia that the company plans to focus especially on the development of video production, web design, mobile content and e-learning. <br><br>  The important point is that Adobe began its production in Russia and intends to seriously develop this area.  In late 2007 - early 2008  Production of the company in Russia will provide customers with localized Photoshop Elements 6.0 and a number of commercial products.  According to Pavel Cherkashin, the cost of delivery and customs expenses amount on average to about 30-50% of the final price of the product in Russia.  Production will help to effectively reduce the proportion of such expenses.  The company currently sells its products in Russia using authorized resellers and distributors.  They themselves do not plan to sell. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt is clear that Adobe's well-growing sales in Russia are due to the large-scale legalization process in the country.  First of all, the legalization campaign is focused on Microsoft products, but it also seriously touched Adobe products - they are very popular in Russia and in the overwhelming majority of counterfeit investigations also figure, ‚Äùsaid Oleg Savtsov, deputy general director of Armada. .  According to the expert, Adobe‚Äôs goal of reducing piracy is very real: ‚ÄúThe main consumers of Adobe products in Russia are companies, and the process of their legalization is somewhat easier than in the case of private users.‚Äù <br><br>  As for the company's expansion into online and towards mobile users, Mr. Savtsov believes that the company has chances for success: ‚ÄúOf course, it is quite difficult to say for sure, this is a very unexpected step from Adobe.  Nevertheless, the company can get ahead if it offers any non-standard solutions other than Microsoft and Google.  Adobe may try to go to untapped niches.  So, there are more and more new devices, it is worth remembering the same Apple iPhone.  Microsoft and Google have not yet begun to widely offer their development for this product, and Adobe, for example, can do it before them. ‚Äù <br><br>  Note that the gradual legalization of software in Russia has noticeably improved the financial performance of many companies.  Good growth recently, due, in particular, to the positive effect of reducing the level of piracy, was shown by Kaspersky Lab - 130%, Microsoft Russia - 107%, AutoDesk - 160%, etc. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/">CNews.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14872/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14872/</a></p>
