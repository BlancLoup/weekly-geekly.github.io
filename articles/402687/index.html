On the market, such devices are represented by a huge number of models with very different functionality and quality.  The price, of course, is also different.  There are portable audio class "luxury" with an almost divine sound and the price of a cast-iron bridge, and there are Chinese tweeters, which are sold almost by weight. <br><br>  In such a saturated market, it is difficult to expect the appearance of any noticeable device.  But as it turned out, nothing is impossible.  This was proven by Divoom with its pixel-based wireless speaker.  Divoom TimeBox is no longer just an audio system, but a convenient accessory with a clock, wireless communication module, microphone, radio module and one hundred and twenty-one LEDs on the front side.  Let's see what this device can do. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Or maybe he really has a lot.  Thanks to the wireless communication module, the speaker can be connected to almost any gadget that can play music.  Tablet, smartphone, laptop - without a difference.  In addition, there is also a built-in microphone, so that the speaker can be used as a hands-free, if a phone or laptop is connected with a VoIP messenger.  The power of the speaker is not so great, 5 W, but this is quite enough to be able to listen to loud music in the room.  The battery lasts about 6-8 hours of work.

      In the package we have a USB-to-microUSB cable, a 3.5 mm audio cable (yes, you can listen to music when connected via wire, why not), the instruction and the speaker itself. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69c/383/b0d/69c383b0d1df46b3b0eb50498701da96.PNG" width="450"></a> <br><br>  You can control the device using a mobile application, as well as ordinary buttons, which are located on the upper face of the Divoom TimeBox.  The buttons are pressed with a click, they are rubberized.  The application allows you to fine-tune the column, for example, the selection of various images, animated images, sound changes and other things.  Since there is a radio module here, the speaker can also be used as a radio receiver - it is easy to perform frequency scanning from the screen of a mobile device connected to the Divoom TimeBox.  You can customize the customization of notifications - for example, the arrival of an SMS message, a call to WhatsApp or via a regular mobile connection. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/490/366/956/490366956e254c4ea1ffcc51160e85bf.PNG" width="450"></a> <br>  <i>Clicking the screenshot will open in full size.</i> <br><br>  And there are also games here - they allow you to relax and spend a few minutes driving pixel typewriters along a pixel highway. <br><br>  The speaker can be placed in the office or at home, using it as a clock, an alarm clock, a radio alarm clock, or the source of a fairly high-quality sound.  In memory, the speakers are loaded with 20 soothing melodies that help a person calm down and fall asleep.  Among other melodies can be called the sound of the ocean, foliage and some other pleasant combinations of sounds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae6/b85/777/ae6b857777854cb8adadf383fb7debc8.PNG" width="1000"><br><br>  There is also <b>a night</b> light <b>function</b> - the column can be used as a source of dim light by choosing a specific color of the front panel LEDs in the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ca6/e21/951/ca6e21951270ca27029174c5f54ef99f.jpg" width="1000"><br><br>  If you don‚Äôt want to be particularly clever, then you just have to set the time display and limit it to that.  The most interesting thing is still the work on customizing the device.  At first, you can spend hours digging in the catalog of animated and ordinary drawings provided by the developer on your website or application.  A little later, when the enthusiasm subsides a bit, you can already begin to understand the functionality of the gadget itself. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/71c/e4c/984/71ce4c984b3220551998d639db73bf0d.jpg" width="850"><br>  By the way, the device is collected on the conscience.  The ends of the speakers are made of soft-touch non-dirty soft-touch plastic.  Conclusions for cables of different types are on the back side, at the bottom of the column.  By the way, the speakers are also located on the back side.  If necessary, the column can be rebooted using a button which is recessed into the case, which is usual for tablets or phones. <br><br>  Oh yes, there is also a built-in thermometer, so you will always know the temperature inside the room. <br><br>  Of the useful features can be called another <b>smart alarm clock</b> .  A few minutes before the user-defined wake-up time, the column begins to gradually increase the brightness of the LEDs, at the same time changing their color to red and orange.  Due to this, certain parts of the brain are activated that are responsible for the awakening and activity of a person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c17/5a9/bfd/c175a9bfde194fe944ec304c34a897e7.jpg" width="1000"><br><br>  The column can be used as an <b>organizer of the daily routine</b> - for example, a child.  This can be done by setting the appearance of icons on the front panel.  With such reminders, neither the parents nor the child himself (if this is not about a very baby) will not forget what needs to be done during the day.  Actually, the daily routine can also be formed by an adult. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/500/0e0/3e5/5000e03e58af4a0799c8551becc70a9a.PNG" width="450"></a> <br>  <i>Baby Day Planning Example</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67f/f18/e8e/67ff18e8e2e94cec98b630c8fc5eec01.PNG" width="450"></a> <br>  <i>An example of planning a day for an older child - for example, a student</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/831/f1a/8f5/831f1a8f5acc41a893a6c7ee142c551c.PNG" width="450"></a> <br>  <i>Adult day planning example</i> <br><br>  Plus, the column is equipped with a carbon dioxide sensor.  CO <sub>2</sub> is a colorless gas that is heavier than air and has no odor.  The higher its concentration in the room, the worse a person feels: his performance deteriorates, the possibility of concentration is lost. <br><br>  <b>Divoom TimeBox Features</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Weight: 383 g; </li><li>  Size: 114 x 115.8 x 55 mm; </li><li>  LEDs: 121 RGB LEDs; </li><li>  Management: the application on the smartphone TimeBox App; </li><li>  Temperature sensor: yes; </li><li>  Speaker: 76 mm; </li><li>  Output power: 5 W; </li><li>  Frequency: 60-20000 Hz; </li><li>  Noise level: ~ 75 dB; </li><li>  Music playback time: up to 6 hours; </li><li>  Battery Capacity: 2000 mAh; </li><li>  Charging time: 3-4 hours; </li><li>  Voltage: 3.7 V; </li><li>  Charging method: USB cable, 5 V / 1 A; </li><li>  Wireless interface: Bluetooth V4.0; </li><li>  Range: 10 m; </li><li>  Available pixel colors: 256 colors. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f5a/c99/70f/f5ac9970f0d254e60dbe1e9c5192d1f3.jpg" width="1000"><br><br><h3>  What is the result? </h3><br>  We at Madrobots are impressed with the capabilities of this device.  It is not too expensive, but very functional.  As mentioned above, this smart column with a pixel display can be useful both at home and in the office.  It easily covers the sound of a small room, and the sound quality is excellent.  Divoom TimeBox, among other things, is also a great gift, like yourself, your beloved (or beloved) and any other person - colleague, relative, child. <br><br>  You <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/divoom-timebox/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3DTimeBox">can</a> always buy Divoom TimeBox in Russia <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/divoom-timebox/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3DTimeBox">from Madrobots</a> . <br><br><hr><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3DTimeBox"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/4c3/07d/d294c307dde04335ac3f425e73b36a7a.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3DTimeBox"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/417/fe3/7fa417fe3d464fa5aa186b1ab30da53a.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402687/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402687/</a></p>
