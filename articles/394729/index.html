So far, not all the results of the study have been published, moreover, it has not yet been confirmed by reviews of independent experts. <br><br>  Commenting on the study, experts who did not take part in the work criticize the haste of disclosing incomplete data and urge not to panic because of the unconfirmed connection between mobile phones and cancer tumors.

      A study worth $ 25 million, started back in 2005, showed that in mice exposed to radio waves, the incidence of tumors increased: gliomas in the brain and neuromas on the nerves of the heart.  In mice that lived without exposure to radio waves, tumors did not appear.  At the same time, the appeared tumors are similar to those found in one of the previous epidemiological studies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/telecom/wireless/cellphones-are-a-carcinogenic-hazard-says-the-world-health-organization">A previous study</a> was conducted by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2011.  According to the analysis of many works, experts wrote a conclusion stating that radio waves are ‚Äúpossibly carcinogenic to humans.‚Äù  Evidence of this was limited and incomplete - but it was clear from the work that the risk of glioma and acoustic nerve neuroma in regular telephone users increased by 40‚Äì200%. <br><br>  The results of the current study have not yet been published in full, and other experts have not yet evaluated their accuracy.  The NTP explained the desire to publish raw data by saying that even a small increase in the likelihood of tumors will have a huge impact on the health of the nation due to the prevalence of mobile phones. <br><br>  Mice were exposed to radio waves in special underground laboratories.  The 900 MHz waves were modulated using CDMA and GSM schemes.  Mice were exposed to waves before birth and during their two-year life in different doses - from zero for the control group, to 6 W per kilogram of weight.  For 18 hours each day, the radiation was turned on and off with periods of 10 minutes.  In total, seven test groups of 90 mice each participated in the experiments. <br><br>  Gliomas occurred in 2-3% of the population, neuromas - in 1-6%, and the latter occurred much more often with increasing radiation power.  Two incomprehensible facts were noted: these tumors arose exclusively in male mice, while mice that lived without exposure to radiation died, on average, before those who received doses of radio emission. <br><br>  What do these results mean?  In fact, it is unclear.  <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/05/need-rat-tumors-prove-phones-cause-cancer/">As</a> David Rock√©, who is not related to biostatistics research, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/05/need-rat-tumors-prove-phones-cause-cancer/">explains</a> [David Rocke], first of all, it‚Äôs necessary to take into account that mice are not people.  Of course, they are the most popular creatures for research, but only because research cannot be conducted on humans.  As a result, for example, a drug for one of the types of cancer that was tested on mice did not help 96% of people in clinical trials. <br><br>  In the meantime, <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/26/055699">these studies</a> , with complete, not selective, you need to look at other, independent experts.  Were the experiments carried out with the observance of a scientific approach, were there any susceptibility to mice in tumors, were there more tumors than could be expected in a normal situation, were these cases correctly counted, and were the results of the calculations correctly interpreted? .. <br><br>  Even if all these questions are given good answers, this will not be a reason for banning mobile phones.  According to Roque, further it will be necessary to find out whether the tumors were really the result of exposure to radio waves, whether the tumors have the necessary signs of this.  Then you can analyze the genome and other parameters of mice and try to figure out whether the same conditions will cause tumors in humans. <br><br>  It is also necessary to check whether the radiation doses were too large for the mice.  As Roque says, a person can kill anything if he takes too much of it.  And the mice were exposed to radiation, which is 5-7 times greater than that of typical phone users. <br><br>  In general, do not throw out your phone yet.  In addition, an even <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275472/">more extensive study</a> conducted in Australia over a period of 29 years showed that, in parallel with the sharp increase in the number of mobile phones and the time of their use, the number of cases of occurrence of tumors in humans remained virtually unchanged. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394729/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394729/</a></p>
