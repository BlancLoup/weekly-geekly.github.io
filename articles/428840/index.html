No, rolled.  7 jobs, 7 changes, and it is still unknown that there is ahead - alas, in the world of corporations there is no such thing as once and for all, one entry in labor, one love and completely given soul and mind.  Now everything is cool and tomorrow morning I will happily go to the office, but who knows, who knows, not everything depends on us.  So, layoffs are different: bad, good, forced, scandalous.  And let's discuss how it happens, how to leave beautifully or not to leave at all. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/post/428840/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dp/2b/sv/dp2bsv2kne4wdf1khbnvbld9n4c.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So let's talk about working in the commercial field.  Why do I emphasize this?  In the government or in the field of education, everything is somehow simpler and more formal: in 90% of cases you realize that you are either a temporary screw in this device and are morally ready to move on, or you came, sat on the iron bum on the state allowance and know how to sit out until retirement.  But something tells me that there are no such people on Habr√©. <br><br>  And yes, I am not HR, if I am mistaken somewhere in terms of labor law, do not judge strictly.  There is more about relationships.

      So, you work in a commercial company, perform your duties, interact with colleagues and suddenly something went wrong. <br><br><h2>  You have not passed the trial period </h2><br>  In general, on probation, it is quite problematic to fire a person - there must be good reasons confirming that he is not doing his job.  Therefore, as in all cases, we seldom hear such a formulation, and we part ‚Äúon our own.‚Äù  If you are told that you have not coped with the work and hint at dismissal in the first three months of work, it is better not to swing the law and not to resist - no matter how much you stay in this company, it will not grow together.  The only chance for accretion is if, by some happy (unfortunate) event, the team that was with you at the start is replaced. <br><br>  So what to do. <br><br><ul><li>  Politely and carefully ask what your colleagues are not satisfied with.  This is not tediousness and not principled, but the opportunity to look at oneself from the outside, especially at the beginning of a career.  Listen to what you are told - this is valuable information that is worth working with. <br></li><li>  If you care about the company (wow, I'm in ...), ask if there is a need for personnel in another team.  The fact is that money, time and effort were spent on your attraction and initial adaptation, something is already known about you, your level of ability to work is clear.  So, it is very likely that you will find a place in the company.  Well, you gradually show yourself and be able to move to the desired position.  For example, if not developed in the development, then in support and testing, you can easily be number one and indispensable colleague.  Feel free to try - the crown will not fall. <br></li><li>  If everything is deaf or in the company there is no chance for growth, in a good way say goodbye to your colleagues - the IT industry is narrow, you still have to work in it. <br></li><li>  At the interview for a new job do not pour tons of dirt on your previous employer - this will definitely turn against you. <br></li><li>  If you feel that you really screwed up and leave in a bad way, talk to the personnel department, explain the situation and ask you not to talk badly about you in the case of a call. <br></li></ul><br>  Often the question arises whether such a short period of work should be entered into the work book.  It is up to you: it is sometimes convenient to hide this period and say that you are freelance this time, and sometimes it is good to include similar experience in your track record and explain what you have learned during this time.  For example, in my work there is a work period of 20 days.  I basically asked to write, it was my first place in the commercial structure.  And it came in handy :-) <br><br><h2>  You leave of your own accord </h2><br>  For IT professionals, this is probably the most common case: employees go for a bigger salary, to a more prestigious place, and finally to a more interesting or promising project.  And this is the moment when both the employee and the employer should disperse as painlessly and honestly as possible. <br><br>  If you are an employee. <br><br><ul><li>  Tell the employer about your future job and explain how attractive it is to you.  Be sure to emphasize that the transition to a new job is the result of the achievements and experience gained at the current location. <br></li><li>  Tell us about the true motives of the transition - it is very possible that the employer has a new direction in his head, but he did not know who to charge him with, and then you, and with such potential.  Then you can stay in your familiar environment and win everything else.  Again, perhaps you will increase wages. <br></li><li>  In no case do not play with the employer in the outbid - who will offer more wages for your smart head.  It spoils the relationship great.  Even if you are offered the level with which you agree to stay, show that this is your mutual decision (and not a favor of one of the parties). <br></li><li>  Tell about the care as soon as possible, and not for the standard two weeks - first of all, you will be able to transfer your affairs, and even participate in the selection of an employee to your place.  No need to be jealous or mischievous - in the end, you went through some kind of career in this job, spare your efforts.  The better you give things, the more stable your part of the project will continue to grow. <br></li><li>  If the reason for your care lies in another, for example, in interpersonal relations or problems of a psychological nature, delicately but directly report them.  Of course, with them, most likely, nothing will be solved, then there will be no omissions.  But at the same time, you can cast a little shadow on your colleague who is guilty of your departure (but only in the case, work is not a place for vendetta). <br></li><li>  Ask for a recommendation, sign it and put a seal - this document will come in handy for you more than once. <br></li><li>  If you go to competitors, designate that you will not use commercially valuable information (and really do not do it - it will pop up, there will be trouble!). <br></li><li>  In no case do not arrange office intrigue and do not show that you have the power to choose someone who will take your place.  Do not complain to colleagues in the corners and in the smoking room, do not moan that you are an underestimated genius. <br></li></ul><br>  If you are an employer. <br><br><ul><li>  Do not be offended by an employee who leaves.  It is you who have raised a decent employee who is able to move and grow further.  Yes, you have invested in it, certain processes are tied up on it, it is valuable to you, but ... Business is business.  If you can save at the expense of the project or money - take a chance.  But remember: the next time the question of money can turn into a subject of blackmail. <br></li><li>  Try to find out the exact reason for leaving - often this is not at all what is indicated in words.  And this should be done by the immediate supervisor / general, and not by HR.  All these psychological tricks and persuasions of a penny broken do not face an honest and open conversation. <br></li><li>  If the reasons lie outside the material plane, try to understand all the details correctly and persistently - because you need to work with those who caused the departure.  Sometimes such dismissals (especially if there are two or three) are a reason to think, and are you breaking up with those? <br></li><li>  Ask the employee who could take his place, ask to take part in the selection.  This will only strengthen your now just friendship. <br></li></ul><br><h2>  You leave at the request of the employer </h2><br>  The case, when for some reason you were ‚Äúasked‚Äù, reduced, removed, etc.  Very annoying situation that hits backhand and occurs at the most inopportune moment.  In these moments, I want to destroy, break, blame others.  This is complete despair. <br><br><ul><li>  Pull yourself together and be silent for three hours or until the morning. <br></li><li> If you are cut or offered to leave by agreement of the parties, calmly leave.  Your only task is to verify the correct legal registration of dismissal.  If you are confused by the wording, ask to write to you in the care of their own free will. <br></li><li>  If you are guilty and go on a very bad note, try to minimize your guilt and damage from it: work out, fix, apologize, help your colleagues figure it out.  If the situation is critical, take all measures to avoid administrative or criminal penalties. <br></li><li>  If everything was cloudless, ask why the choice fell on you, what specifically your shortcomings.  Again, this information will allow you to analyze errors and not step on the rake again. <br></li><li>  Remit cases in good faith, do not harm your colleagues. <br></li><li>  Do not shit!  After dismissal, do not set inspections, police and other bodies against your employer.  Yes, sometimes it is effective and you will be delighted with penalties and problems, but the Internet is fast, there is a lot of transfer in one transfer industry and your new employer will be very wary of you. <br></li></ul><br><h2>  Special cases </h2><br>  You want a salary increase - ask directly about the increase, reasonably speaking about your work and the reasons why indexation should occur.  The statement about leaving you will not achieve much.  It is more profitable to add your salary than to search and train a beginner.  If you are an efficient and competent employee, the answer will be positive. <br><br>  You have burned out - ask to transfer you to another department, send for training, give new tasks.  The change of activity here is an ideal solution, almost always realized within the company. <br><br>  There was a conflict - do not exaggerate, try to settle the question on the spot.  If you are guilty, try to explain, apologize and settle the problem.  If you are a victim of conflict and are not ready to work with an opponent, discuss with the manager a change in the pattern of internal interaction. <br><br>  It's always hard to quit.  It is difficult to leave, it is difficult to feel like a stranger for two weeks, it is hard to say goodbye and leave the business that you lived for months or years.  But everything can be done humanly, it is enough to act according to conscience. <br><br>  <b>And yes, learn five gold NOT layoffs.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Do not be silent. <br>  Do not blackmail. <br>  DO NOT throw in a statement of care if you do not want to leave. <br>  Do not do nasty things. <br>  DO NOT complain to a new employer about the previous one. <br><br>  Do not be afraid to leave - ahead of the best and new.  Do not rush - your current work has not yet realized your capabilities to the end.  And if you leave - always remain friends, in the business environment it is possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428840/">https://habr.com/ru/post/428840/</a></p>
