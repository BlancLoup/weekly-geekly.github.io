There are no other places relatively decent in Novosibirsk.  Perhaps I am mistaken, but then let elder comrades correct them. <br><br>  So, DC Sibirtelecom, perhaps the only large DC not at the trunk, however, STK provided pretty good conditions for placement.  BUT, in connection with the launch of a new DC, Sibirtelecom has proposed conditions that will be located on which in the current reality is not possible.  (if earlier I deployed equipment for several thousand with a 100 Mbps port, then the same money is wanted in the new DC Sibirtelecom, but for the 10 Mbps and 1 unit) Due to the fact that there is no desire to accommodate in the new DC from Sibirtelecom the old ones are not being driven, then it probably makes no sense to talk about the old DC. <br><br>  DC Rostelecom, launched with fanfare in March 2008, with the placement contract signed at the same time, in reality, the deployment took place only in October 2008. All this time, Rostelecom changed management, managers, made connection diagrams, bought a diesel generator and many things another thing that shouldn't have bothered me.  But the fact remains that it was easy to have a baby for the period from the moment of signing the contract until the equipment was placed.  Now you can put much faster as far as I know, but three out of 16 equipment racks six months ago were taken. <br><br>  DC ZSTTK, I have never seen ads that provide this kind of service, but after talking with a couple of managers, it was possible to agree on placement. <br><br>  DC RTCOMM, these guys always say ‚Äúyou can‚Äù :) But it was possible to locate it the second time, trying to get up in 2008 took 4 months of approvals.  At the end of 2009, agreed and delivered in a couple of days. <br><br>  Conditions for resources generating over 2Tbytes in all DCs, usually implies only payment for the port and unit. <br><br>  And now, as a joke about the lieutenant Rzhevsky, that is NUANCE! <br><br>  Placing in a DC when choosing a tariff plan that implies certain ratios of traffic and payment when they are not observed, remember one thing, if you do not have a certified billing with all the consequences (licenses, approvals), then you can only trust DC billing.  And, accordingly, constant monitoring of the load on the network and comparing it with the data of the billing of the DC are necessary, so that at the end of the month they should not have a provider of several tens or hundreds of kilorubbles. <br><br>  RTCOMM, everything is fine, billing allows you to see the load on the port by the day, but in addition to the ratio of incoming to outgoing, you must respect the ratio of the outgoing Russian / foreign 60k40.  The point is that getting a list of subnets that RTCOMM considers Russian does not work.  In billing, the link to the subnet file is broken, and managers and billing operators do not provide data saying that everything is spinning in billing, nobody knows how to spin, and in general, I‚Äôm not the first to ask for a subnetwork and not the first one to say so.  Specially on the basis of <a href="http://www.wipmania.com/ru/">http://www.wipmania.com/ru/</a> filtered Russian traffic to another server, but they see the ‚Äúforeign‚Äù in the hrkomme, which makes one think about the relevance of subnets in their billing. <br><br>  Rostelecom, I do not recommend installing equipment in the case of tariff plans related to traffic ratios.  The billing of Rostelecom provides data when they are already calculated and rated (on the first day after the month following the reporting month), which means that you counted how much you will pay.  It is for this reason that I had to remove my equipment from there.  The traffic that my monitoring tools did not see Rostelecom saw and counted.  I admit the options, when it can be so, BUT, they don‚Äôt provide any intelligible specification at Rostelecom in the absence of such, and in the presence of their certified ACP and in the absence of it, it will be clear to me who it is.  The billing of Rostelecom is so accurate that it detected traffic overspending in February 2010 for September 2009!  In this incident there is still a trial, but it seems to me, the last will still be me according to the law. <br><br>  ZSTTK, for these guys I can not yet find the minuses, it does not mean that they are not there, it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs very difficult to get into the DC and it‚Äôs not a fact that in the event of an accident you can quickly arrange access. <br><br>  Prices (per unit): <br>  Rostelecom <b>590</b> <br>  RTCOMM <b>1600</b> units + <b>800</b> per port <br>  ZSTTK <b>1200</b> <br><br>  Cost in rubles without VAT <br><br>  In addition to payment for accommodation, if you wish to gain access to the nsk-ix, you need to pay separately the cross-connection to the equipment of Russia. <br>  At ZSTTK about 10k wanted for this, but for RTKOMMU and Rostelecom exact figures on cross-connects: <br>  Rostelecom <b>5798</b> <br>  RTCOMM <b>1300</b> <br>  Cost in rubles without VAT <br><br>  At these prices the placement actually went or goes, although I admit that such silk prices were exclusively for me. <br><br>  In the photo in the title of the post, the old DC RKOMM. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93963/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93963/</a></p>
