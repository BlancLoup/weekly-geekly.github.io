      When a driver was developed for recording and reading data from a tape recorder, various modulation methods with self-synchronization were tried.  In the end, the two-phase encoding method was chosen.  But it's not about that.  While working, the thought came - ‚ÄúWhat if there is speech or music at the entrance?‚Äù.  The signal from the line output was fed to the input of the comparator.  If it is above a certain threshold - then "1", below - "0".  Cooked up a simple program.  At equal intervals of time, the output of the comparator was polled, the duration of zeros and ones was counted and recorded in memory.  Then the second program gave the recorded zeros and ones of the corresponding duration to the speaker via a one-bit port. <br>  Amazingly, it turned out that the recorded speech was quite picky!  Of course, then after digging into the literature, they found out that this is the same bike, known since 1948.  Delta modulation method. <br>  In 1986, the magazine Microprocessor Tools and Systems organized a series of lectures on microprocessors and computers in the large hall of the Polytechnic Museum.  To ‚Äúrevive‚Äù my speech, I remembered these experiences.  I asked someone to say a few words to the microphone connected via an amplifier to the computer's tape recorder.  Something like "Mommy soap frame."  Reproduced, the hall frankly was delighted!  It's not like listening to multichannel audio through a 32-bit DAC. <br>  Ironically, all modern high-quality sound DAC and ADC use exactly the method of delta-sigma modulation / demodulation! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1d/e65/9db/a1de659db9644aa6b64f3d3bb99ef89a.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd4/5c7/9e7/bd45c79e7fac48858dee66b7ce5aa2d8.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Secret knowledge - the people!</b> <br><br>  In the 70s and early 80s, all samizdat manuscripts printed on a typewriter or on a drum printer with a caps went around.  Incidentally, I read ‚ÄúRoadside Picnic‚Äù in the same way.  Once I saw my wife's battered creation - "Horoscope".  In secret passed from one woman to the other.  Under honest pioneer took him from his wife for a few days. <br>  At the same time, it was possible to connect to the Micro-80 the matrix printer of the company WANG, obtained for temporary use from the USSR State Committee.  Heavy, 15 pounds weighed. <br>  I wrote a program on BASIC, which, by the date of birth and the name you entered, formed a page of text that was completely filled with invaluable information about your character and fate (family, children, career, etc.).  In addition, what stones should you wear on your fingers, and which can be inserted into the ears and slay all.  Well, you understand - true secret knowledge.  Then everything was printed in one page. <br>  If only the fair sex stood in a queue for the desired page ... Any visitors in the department would certainly want to know about themselves what only the mysterious K580IK80 knows.  As a person close to an oracle, I personally conducted data entry manipulations.  There was one secret in the program, although in reality there were a lot of them.  If the patient (s) was (a) what is called the right person - I pressed an extra space at the end of the input.  Such oil and glorification was printed on the seal, that people, having read, simply melted before our eyes and carefully carried away the leaf with them.  All the rest of the program was cutting, so to speak, the truth-womb. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c83/6e0/398/c836e0398db640d1ae99cb3664303ef6.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f0/e83/91c/2f0e8391c514498cad511c28c182fe55.jpg"><br><br>  <b>KKK</b> <br><br>  In 1985 (86?), He came to a friend at the Institute for Information Transmission Problems (IITP, USSR Academy of Sciences).  We sit in his laboratory, discuss something, transmit information, so to speak.  They already had a couple of IBM PC / XT.  The end of the working day, everyone has already gone, only we are in place. <br>  The door to the laboratory periodically opens, some people drop in and immediately close it.  I ask - "Who is this?  What do they want?  He replies - ‚ÄúYes, this is our Ku Klus clan.  KKK - Computer Crocodile Club.  So we call them.  When people leave work, they close in our laboratory, sit quietly, like crocodiles stalking prey.  They are waiting for everyone to completely disperse.  And then all night they play games on our computers, in turn, maybe even for money. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e4/a27/f8c/6e4a27f8c4f64b5f9432102bbc37f9a9.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Supermasher</b> <br><br>  Before defending his thesis, he brought a printed and bound copy to his official opponent.  He flipped through it.  So, there is text, there are tables, there are formulas, there are diagrams and graphs.  It seems everything is in order.  But he continues to flip it back and forth.  I even got worried.  He asks - ‚ÄúListen, where did you find such a high-class typist?  Nowhere is nothing smeared or reprinted.  And most importantly - I do not understand how it manages to align the right edge? ‚Äù.  I answer, nice girl, hardworking and not expensive takes.  One drawback is the foreign surname, consul. ‚Äù <br>  WAC in those years was strict - the text should be typed only on a typewriter with a standard size.  I typed and edited text in WordStar 3.0 under CP / M 2.2. <br>  CONSUL with electric carriage and electromagnets on the keys was on the department.  Made a control interface to the "Micro-80".  When he printed - the sound is like a war, continuous machine gunfire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aea/ca6/449/aeaca64496dd4870908ddebe8cf71224.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/155/d6e/f91/155d6ef91e9f441db3236153e43d6a61.jpg"><br><br>  <b>From sumy to prison ...</b> <br><br>  When it came time to acquaint people through the magazine "Radio" not only with the diagrams, but also make them happy with software, the question arose - how? <br>  Prior to this, in the USSR, no one had any experience of publishing programs in machine codes. <br>  We are with Zelenko G.V.  came to the editorial office of the magazine "Radio" to the deputy editor-in-chief Stepanov Boris Grigorievich.  And they showed him several pages filled with digits and letters - a dump of the program.  He turned them on and off this way and asked an unexpected question: ‚ÄúWell, let's say we publish this abracadabra.  The people click on the tumblers, these are your zeros and ones.  And where is the guarantee that after launching the program, it will not write on the screen: <br><br>  DOWN THE CPSU! <br>  USSR-prison of the people! <br><br>  We were confused.  And he looks so sly, smiles, and says: "Well, all right, let's sit down!"  And signed the article in print. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/00b/cd8/6d0/00bcd86d07e047d7876edb193d1bde95.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Many knowledge - many sorrows</b> <br><br>  In the early 80s, we concluded research on the automation of various medical procedures using the emerging microprocessor technologies.  Cooperated with the Institute of Transplantology.  The future academician Valery Ivanovich Shumakov was at that time engaged in practicing the techniques necessary for a heart transplant. <br>  We liked to go there on local business trips - there was a wonderful dining room.  The first, main dishes just shine, better than in a restaurant and for a penny.  As he praised the canteen local employee, they say what a wonderful.  He says - "We always have everything fresh."  I ask - "From where?".  Employee - ‚ÄúWhat about you, don't you know?  Shumakov practices techniques on the calves.  Unfortunately, they do not live long.  Quickly come to our dining room. ‚Äù  I wish I did not know ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce5/972/5ea/ce59725ea411459483c8dde4bdc02612.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b48/80e/b5f/b4880eb5fa2349d4b748d8fecd4b67a7.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Deterministic life</b> <br><br>  In their youth, everyone loves to talk about high matters.  Is there life on Mars?  What is better - to be young and healthy or old and sick?  Is everything predetermined or is there free will? <br>  On the last question was a supporter of the presence of this very freedom.  But one case, though not convincingly, made me doubt. <br>  Again, a local trip to the MEPI, there were seriously engaged in microprocessor-related topics.  All strictly, the form number 2, the order pass.  I gave the passport to the pass office window.  The strict woman, in years, having thrown a steadfast look at me, began to fill the admission.  I looked through it and suddenly zarzhet.  And she began to show my passport to other employees.  Those too are having fun from the heart. <br>  I'm at a loss.  What is it about my passport?  He draws it to me and says: ‚ÄúWe congratulate you to all the bureau, although I‚Äôm not going to see you in time, but I‚Äôm not going to meet the deadline.‚Äù  It was in 1982, I recently changed my passport.  It was opened on the page with the stamp on the marriage.  Everything was fine there, the name of the spouse, where combined, but the year was 1983! <br><br>  Here, perhaps, that's all.  The 32-bit era has come. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372105/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372105/</a></p>
