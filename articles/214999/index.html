Our project is aimed at making the rather unpleasant process of searching for performers of various kinds of repair and construction works more convenient.  The idea itself was born as a result of a long and unsuccessful search for the performer, which is rather ordinary for the country residents of the process - digging a well.  I spent a lot of free time in search of a worthy applicant, looked through many websites of teams and companies that deal with the type of work I needed, tried to find adequate reviews for these companies.  The result of all this was the feeling of wasted time, since all the brigades and companies vouch for their work, promised the <s>golden mountains</s> deep and aquifer wells, and adequate feedback from people who used the services of the organization was not found. <a name="habracut"></a>  And then I realized that at the moment there is simply no fast and reliable way to find a proven work force.  After all, when we need to glue the wallpaper, change the battery, cycle the floor, then there are not so many ways to find artists: <br><br><ol><li>  Internet search - in this case, you have to either overpay to large and well-known repair and construction companies, or risk money with untested small teams that you need to try to find; </li><li>  Survey of friends - you can refer to friends who have recently made repairs and were satisfied with the result, and get the necessary contacts.  And it may even be lucky if your friend himself is engaged in an activity of interest - in this case the probability of <s>resist</s> poorly performed work is extremely small; </li><li>  Well, the very old old-fashioned way - searching for ads at the entrance - is also a very dubious option. </li></ol><br>  <i>Note - You must immediately retreat.</i>  <i>At that time - about 1.5 - 2 years ago - I, with all my desire and variety of search queries, could not find sites that implement the functionality of our project at least a little.</i>  <i>But already in the process of developing our service, the analogues were discovered, but it was too late to retreat, as they say.</i>

      The ideal resource seemed to me like Yandex.Market, where the user can either choose by category exactly the branch he is interested in and see the teams and companies with their reviews, photos of completed work and other information, or place their order and choose from those teams that responded to his proposal. <br>  I was carrying this idea for quite a while.  This was partly due to lack of free time, but the main reason was the lack of a budget for the development of this project.  The amounts needed for the project were beyond my means, and my knowledge was clearly not enough.  Therefore, the idea for a long time remained just an idea. <br>  But the stars so happened that after a while I met a person who supported my idea and as a result of a long search we were able to find someone who had enough knowledge to implement the idea.  And he called the sum quite adequate for our budget - absolutely free.  Yes Yes.  It happens in life.  Only one idea was able to assemble a small but ambitious team, ready to implement all the plans and develop the service to the bitter end. <br>  At this point I will finish the preface.  Omit all moments of a long and tedious coordination of the basic concepts of creating a service.  And without this, the preface was unexpectedly long and drawn out. <br><br><h5>  The main part (the main stages of creating a service and the techniques for its implementation are considered) </h5><br>  It all started with the fact that as a result of the auction, we miraculously acquired the domain name ordo.ru, which was luckily released at the very moment of our search. <br>  The second issue, which took us quite a lot of time, was the choice of the concept of finding the necessary services.  The initial idea of ‚Äã‚Äãits implementation was aimed at maximum visualization by providing the user with an image of the property in the context where he was asked to choose the parts that need to be repaired / built.  Like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc7/a43/44c/dc7a4344c5638116a3e9bd3cbfe6c53c.jpg"><br><br>  Or so: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/033/3ba/b6c/0333bab6cdd07023c950a46181e4d5da.jpg"><br><br>  But for the first time we had to abandon this option due to the complexity of its implementation.  It was decided to start the project with a simple search and filters. <br>  After some time, the first version of our site is working in test mode.  It was a mixture of a bulletin board and a social network with teams and companies sorted by types of construction and repair works.  By one-time targeted advertising over the course of several days, the first hundred registered teams were formed, through which the service was tested.  We worked out the site, fixed bugs and typos.  It is worth noting that so far in this regard, we are not perfect. <br><br>  <i>Note - Many inaccuracies and errors have been found for a long time, but since this project is only a hobby and cannot yet fully provide its participants with financial support, there is simply not enough time to correct them.</i>  <i>But we are trying and constantly improving what has already been done, not forgetting to add new functionality.</i> <br><br>  Malomalsky functional for construction teams was implemented, but the logic of the organization of our filters was still very undeveloped.  Unfortunately, I could not find the final image with filters, but I am attaching an intermediate version: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e7/13f/884/8e713f884d5ae88034075a0046b85f89.jpg"><br>  At that stage, the builders could already create their own pages with descriptions, contacts, and photographs of the work performed.  Users, in turn, could view all the information and leave feedback and ratings.  Of course, there was no question of any rating system at that time.  The three main branches - "Apartments", "Suburban Real Estate", "Commercial Real Estate" - were large sheets, cut into 20 companies, sorted in the order of registration (new companies - at the top). <br>  But after a while the rating was implemented.  We did not reinvent the wheel and invent some abstruse sly formula for calculating the rating of a particular brigade.  We used the Yandex article, which describes in detail how the rating is calculated in Yandex.Metrica (for which we express our deep appreciation to Yandex).  The formula is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b2/ad9/f8e/3b2ad9f8e6b8ef20e94550e901d348cb.png"><br><br>  Where: <br><br><ul><li><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90d/e2d/412/90de2d412c613fa20e4fd5f09bbb3cb9.png">  - assessment team by users; </li><li><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/04e/831/5cb/04e8315cb7af42ed0b62a0d25f86b3ec.png">  - team assessment by administrators, that is, us; </li><li><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a7/c4e/01d/5a7c4e01dd52c3fec20a2233ecd30811.png">  - the number of user ratings. </li></ul><br><br>  At the moment, this method adequately sorts our entire database of ads, bringing a bit of justice into the insane competition inherent in this service sector. <br>  It should be noted here that we approach the control of the process of leaving reviews and ratings by users quite carefully.  When leaving a review and evaluation, the user needs to fill in the required field ‚ÄúTelephone number for communication‚Äù, by which we check the reliability of the information provided, and only after that we add the text of the review and rating to the site. <br><br>  Well, the last step that can be distinguished is to enable users to publish orders for which teams and companies will leave their responses.  To be completely honest, this function was not originally envisaged by us, but was spied on by one of the competitors, and, what can we say, is really convenient for the end user.  It was introduced quite recently and is in the process of testing. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br><br>  So what is the purpose of this article? <br><br>  The first and most important task is to present our project to a wide audience consisting mainly of professionals in their field.  We very much hope for constructive criticism and comments.  None of us can say with confidence that the path or implementation that has been chosen is extremely true.  We are interested in both technical notes and advice on the implementation of the design. <br><br>  In the end, we have a project that only outlines the contours of its development.  What has already been implemented today needs to be refined for a long time and thoroughly, at the same time introducing new functionality.  But despite this, we did what we had planned for a long time.  As they say, a start. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214999/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214999/</a></p>
