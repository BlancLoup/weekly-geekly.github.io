      Projects that have submitted applications are gradually published on the website of <a href="http://spanish-village.com/ru/contest/projects/">Spanish Village</a> - the geography is broad - Riga, Tallinn, Minsk, Vinnitsa, Lutsk, Petrozavodsk, St. Petersburg, Samara, Tomsk, Novosibirsk. <br><br>  Today we want to tell you about four promising projects from the StartupPoint community that want to work on a project in Spain.  <b>Comment on projects - startup industry analyst Sergey Vasilyev (StartupPoint) and representative of Spanish Village Sergey Ivanenko</b> . <br><br>  We ask you to leave your opinion on the projects in the comments to the post! <br><br><img src="http://daoffice.ru/css/images/logo.png" align="left" alt="image"><br>  Startup <a href="http://startuppoint.ru/startup/daOffice">DaOffice</a> is a corporate social network for personnel management. <br><br>  Site <a href="http://daoffice.ru/">daoffice.ru</a> <br><br>  HR departments and managers spend a lot of effort on solving problems with the search, adaptation, retention, motivation and efficiency of their employees. <br>  DaOffice product solves these problems in a comprehensive manner with the following tools: <br><ul><li>  Corporate social network allows you to improve communication in the company, develop expertise and stimulate innovation </li><li>  The application "Talent Management" allows you to solve the problem of staff turnover, accelerate the adaptation of newcomers, increase motivation and employee performance </li><li>  The Social Recruiting application allows you to increase the speed and quality of hiring and reduce costs. </li></ul><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Sergey Vasilyev (StartupPoint)</b> : ‚ÄúToday, intranet solutions are becoming increasingly popular in various directions.  HR direction is one of the leading ones in this context.  Despite the fact that there are already some strong solutions in this niche, there is still room for interesting and sensible solutions, such as DaOffice. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Sergey Ivanenko (Spanish Village)</b> : ‚ÄúI see demand for small and medium-sized businesses with a diverse fleet of operating systems.  It‚Äôs good that the service is free in the base configuration, but it‚Äôs bad that the site doesn‚Äôt describe the cost of the premium service.  Not enough version for mobile devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/842/983/d2b/842983d2bb54c14135c8d936ce3ca059.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="http://startuppoint.ru/startup/gipis/"><b>Gipis</b></a> is a service for creating an individual training and nutrition program. <br>  Site <a href="http://gipis.ru/">gipis.ru</a> <br><br>  All physical activity data is collected automatically using a mobile phone and GPS (for remote sports such as running or cycling), as well as using an accelerometer for team sports and training in the gym (football, tennis, fitness, barbell) or heart rate monitor.  Activity data is uploaded to the site, where a further training and nutrition program is generated on their basis.  Depending on the progress of the person, the program is automatically edited so that the user reaches his goal by a certain date, even if part of the workouts have been missed or the nutrition plan has not been respected for some time.  There are mobile versions of the application for the iPhone and Android. <br><br>  <b>Sergey Vasiliev (StartupPoint)</b> : ‚ÄúIncreasingly, Internet resources and services have begun to appear, aimed at solving the problem of overweight, helping users to eat and distribute the load during sports.  A great addition to such services is a mobile device.  Gipis is a very good counterpart of such Western services as: Nike +, Runkeeper, Daily Burn, which has good prospects in Russia. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Sergey Ivanenko (Spanish Village)</b> : ‚ÄúA project with a clear target audience: people leading a healthy lifestyle and monitoring their condition.  The way to monetize the project is not clear to me.  The registration procedure for mobile devices can be simplified using Google or iTunes accounts.  I did not find a description of the calculation algorithms (most likely cardio load) and instructions for working with workouts.  Also did not see anything related to nutrition.  No additional materials and articles about training.  How and what will the GPS receiver collect when practicing in the pool or fitness club? ‚Äù <br><br><img src="http://www.carcorner.ru/images/logotip.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://startuppoint.ru/startup/carcorner.ru/">Carcorner.ru</a> is a platform for car owners designed to help them maintain a car. <br><br>  Website <a href="http://www.carcorner.ru/">www.carcorner.ru</a> <br><br>  The project allows car dealers, car mechanics, auto parts stores, oil change points, etc.  organize your own "virtual garages".  On the basis of the project it is planned to organize an online store and a user blog system. <br><br>  <b>Sergey Vasiliev (StartupPoint)</b> : ‚ÄúThe number of cars per person every year becomes more and more, which is a logical reason for the emergence of new Internet resources for motorists.  Carcorner.ru is one of them.  The peculiarity of the service is that it helps the car owner to remember important events in the life of the car, which is very important in our Russian realities. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Sergey Ivanenko (Spanish Village)</b> : ‚ÄúPleasant service, useful for car owners.  Able to remind by sms or email about the timing of the end of insurance, vehicle inspection, regular maintenance, for any number of cars of the user.  There is not enough background information, but the stated potential is impressive (online check of the fines issued).  Judging by the presence of advertising, the monetization method is advertising.  Clearly not enough version for mobile devices. " <br><br>  The <a href="http://startuppoint.ru/startup/codepays">Codepays</a> project is a payment system for mobile devices based on QR codes. <br><br>  Site <a href="https://codepays.com/">codepays.com</a> <br><br>  The mechanics of the service are as follows: the seller creates a payment in the form of a QR code, the buyer takes a photo of him on his mobile phone and immediately pays for the service with a bank card.  The seller no longer needs to buy additional equipment for making payments with bank cards at points of sale.  You also get the opportunity to distribute QR codes in the media or in public places.  The buyer gets a safe and fast way to pay for purchases without entering bank card details every time.  All mobile platforms are supported for which there is at least one QR code scanner. <br><br>  Commentary by <b>Sergey Vasiliev (StartupPoint)</b> : ‚ÄúCodepays is a project that is in trend, as they say now, mobile applications, payment systems.  In addition, QR codes as a phenomenon is a very hot topic, so the symbiosis of several trend directions will surely give a good result.  The main field of application of this service is retail sales. ‚Äù <br><br>  We remind you that you can still apply for participation before June 23! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122349/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122349/</a></p>
