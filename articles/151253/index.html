  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Quiz Gigabyte: how to mess up with prizes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, Gigabyte conducted an online quiz through its partners - the final sellers of its products, for which conditions were placed on sellers' websites, then they summed up and awarded prizes from the manufacturer.  I was lucky not only to participate, but also by the will of fate - to become one of the winners.  All this is of course wonderful, but not without embarrassment. <br><br>  <i>Just want to say that both Gigabyte itself and the final organizers (in this particular case, the Open Technologies company‚Äôs e2e4 shop turned out to be in this role), everything went exactly with the stated conditions.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, I would like to reflect on the purpose of the quiz and its reasons.  The main reason for me is the recent release by the manufacturer of a new motherboard line on the wide market on the same line of Intel chipsets for the same third-generation Core i3, i5 and i7 processors from the third generation, manufactured with the Socket 1155 installation socket (FCLGA1155).  Accordingly, the purpose of the quiz as a marketing move, I suggest an attempt to draw attention to the event designated by me as the intended reason. <br><br>  In this case, the conditions of the quiz consisted of a proposal to correctly answer 10 questions about the above described Gigabyte motherboards of the new model range and sending answers to the specified coordinates.  Then the first three people (that is, those who sent the answers before all the others) who correctly answered the questions are declared the winners, the next three who answer the questions that are also correctly answered all the questions receive incentive prizes.

With them, I hope everything is really great.  In any case, it turns out very nice and relevant prize.  You could even beat him up as ‚Äúfor motherboards of the new line‚Äù, but for any others, I think, it will do ‚Äî a fairly universal prize. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/091/553/fac/091553fac4ec2788c85c5df6aa4420ab.jpg"><br>  But as incentive prizes for the second three winners were provided with Gigabyte X58A-OC motherboards.  Remarkable motherboards of course, but for Intel processors manufactured with the Socket 1366 installation socket (FCLGA1366), which has already been sent by Intel to the archive in favor of the Socket 2011 processor socket (FCLGA2011), and a generation ago. <br><br>  It turns out that the <i>prize</i> , albeit encouraging, <i>in the quiz about motherboards of a new generation</i> Gigabyte chose a <i>morally obsolete motherboard</i> , which is not compatible with these very technologies of the new generation ... Maybe I have something in life, and in particular - in marketing I don‚Äôt understand, but something seems to me very similar to portraying a good mine in a bad game - it seems like incentive prizes to organize and get rid of obsolete goods in the warehouses, because selling them will already be difficult due to the fact that  in general, no one really needs anyone. <br><br>  <i><b>PS:</b> By coincidence, I just got such a motherboard, what to do with it now - I‚Äôm not going to attach my mind.</i> <br><br>  <i><b>PPS:</b> Against the background of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/151253/">story with a cosmetic bag from the comments,</a> I am immensely happy to receive such an incentive prize.</i>  <i>=)</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151253/</a></p>
