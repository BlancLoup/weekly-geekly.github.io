And we are looking for advice, a manual and confirmation of the correctness of our actions from insecurity in ourselves and our strength and stumble upon raspiarenny idle talkers.  But you only need to act, and if you are wrong or wrong, fix it. <br><br>  If you still have the fear of failure, then you are a goldmine for event organizers.  Also, as someone who fears death or always finds the symptoms of a particular disease, she lived for pharmacologists and scammers selling super-drugs or super-devices that treat all diseases. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Internal conflict </h4><br>  I worked in one company nouneym for organizing events.  The focus of the company was on business, and we invited different speakers and coaches.  I will say right away - basically they were about nothing.  But it was nice to be in that party and to feel important, although now I understand what kind of tinsel it is.  This is a matter of the purchase of Apple technology simply because marketing says so.  If a person is nothing of himself - no powerful familiar or cool thing will not make him something worthwhile. <br><br>  Even though I worked there, I was always disgusted by people who tell stories or demonstrate vividly how they would solve a problem instead of teaching them how to solve this problem.  Like, here's an example - draw your own conclusions.  The fact that there is no benefit from such people is the only conclusion that comes to mind.  Against this background, I did not give out good indicators, and eventually left.

    <h4>  Info gypsies </h4><br>  In the course of my work, I vividly remembered two characters who, to my surprise, are very well known.  Few people know good coaches, but they are more often busy and more in demand in narrow circles.  Obviously, to sell a few hours of useless stories, you need a powerful brand :) <br><br>  <b>The first</b> of these info-gypsies is Maxim Batyrev.  Probably the most famous speaker, author of several books, the holder of the brand "45 tattoos."  In fact, he is an energetic babbler who sells stories from personal experience for big money, tours with him abroad and boasts forged eggs on ropes. <br><br>  All his speeches are stories from life when he once worked in sales and did something.  But times have changed.  And for some reason, neither he nor the participants take this into account.  Trends, times, approaches, conditions, opportunities change.  Something becomes outdated, something loses its relevance. <br><br>  From his stories, you can isolate useful chips.  But in order to introduce them you need to have a good imagination and be able to impose one matrix of reality on another.  In addition, not all sellers have such charisma.  And not all companies have such financial capabilities.  Yes, and Batyrev already understands that he is behind the reality and in time decided to retrain in the "45 parent tattoos." <br><br>  <b>The second</b> is Roman Tarasenko.  I don‚Äôt even remember any special achievements, except for the co-authorship of the book ‚ÄúDo new‚Äù with Igor Mann.  A typical marketer with a beautifully designed info-program and atypical for marketers of his ego level: a very squeezed man who is not sure what he is saying. <br><br>  At his event there was nothing useful, and he himself can not tell anything sensible.  And all the information is available on the Internet.  Roman speaker is boring, trying to be emotional and charismatic, but everyone yawned and some partners admitted afterwards that they wanted to sleep in places. <br><br>  But most of all I was killed by a huge blunder: one casino came to the entire marketing department with the head at the head.  They were interested in the point of the program - the return of customers, which Tarasenko somehow missed.  When the interested party asked the question ‚ÄúSo, how to return customers?‚Äù, In response, excuses and trivialism followed. <br><br><h4>  Good coaches </h4><br>  During my work, I also met two speakers who can teach and teach.  Their approach is simple: to give theory, to fix in practice, to make out mistakes together.  This is the most optimal approach to the study of the material.  Especially at short intervals with a personal example before or after. <br><br>  Examples of such speakers are Igor Ryzov, a negotiating coach, author of the book The Kremlin School of Negotiations, and Vladimir Yakuba, a sales coach.  Igor impressed me most of all because his program and product are truly unique. <br><br><h4>  How to distinguish a bad event from a good one? </h4><br>  Info-gypsies love to embellish the names of their events.  For example, not a ‚Äúmaster class‚Äù, but ‚Äúthe first category lecture!‚Äù.  ‚ÄúOffline information training‚Äú How to win IDE ?! ‚Äù, where 85% of the time you will be given theoretical material, and only then will they go to training with a screen demonstration.  So this is the first point worth paying attention to.  If there is no practical consolidation at the event, this is also a minus (not for conferences).  If the speaker‚Äôs achievements are doubtful, the reviews are perfect, and there are no extended or negative ones at all, then the next seller in front of you is self-confidence, which I assure you will not receive.  Or get, but not for long. <br><br><h4>  Designate goals </h4><br>  If you are going to go to some kind of conference, master class or training, it is a good idea to set yourself goals for which you will go there.  It will also make the trip as productive as possible in terms of time distribution. <br><br>  Goals can be as professional: <br><br><ul><li>  Search customers </li><li>  Partnership </li><li>  Search for colleagues </li><li>  Council to resolve the issue </li></ul><br>  So personal: <br><br><ul><li>  Selfie with speaker </li><li>  New avatar </li><li>  Sign the book </li><li>  Find new acquaintances and friends </li></ul><br><h4>  Social capital </h4><br>  I wrote this article because a similar post was published on my page in VK.  For what I insulted in the drug for Maxim Batyrev.  Unfortunately, most of my friends often talk about the times of the USSR, but they forget that due to the lack of social capital we dropped out of the list of superpowers.  I am not against any events or webinars.  I am for the knowledge to be of high quality and affordable.  And what every third offer now offers is the rapid destruction of social capital. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447770/">https://habr.com/ru/post/447770/</a></p>
