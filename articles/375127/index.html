Under the cut - several tested and recommended life hacking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c08/ad2/398/c08ad23985fab92d2fbd0f0282e682d0.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As an adult, I learned several foreign languages.  I learned spoken French in just 17 days using these techniques.  It should be noted that before that I was already fluent in Spanish, so it was not my first foreign language. <br><br>  In the summer of 2005, I stayed with my French girlfriend in a small village in the Beaujolais region.  In this village, no living soul spoke English, and when my friend found out about my desire to learn French, she forbade me to use another language.

      Every day I did the same exercises. <br><br>  In the mornings I got up and wrote regular and irregular verbs by hand for one and a half to two hours.  So I wrote a whole notebook in two weeks.  I still believe that writing something by hand is the best way to remember it. <br><br>  While I was writing, I was listening to Michel Thomas‚Äôs MP3 tutorial.  On these notes, you listen to the teacher teaching French to other English-speaking people.  It is very useful to hear the mistakes of others - you can learn from them, as in a regular classroom at school.  For two weeks I listened to basic, advanced and grammar course twice. <br><br>  In the afternoon, I ran for 45-60 minutes listening to French music.  This is the best way to learn the intonation of the tongue and to train the muscles of the face, singing along. <br><br>  At lunch I spent time with my girlfriend and her friends.  They stopped repeating phrases slowly, so I just needed to learn to understand them.  Or die of hunger. <br><br>  In the evenings, I played darts or bowles, and also read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in French.  Reading children's books is a great life hacking, allowing you to learn a foreign language.  Firstly, the language is simple, because the book is written for children, and secondly, knowledge of the plot will allow you to think out some words yourself.  For me the surprise was the fact that children's books in other languages ‚Äã‚Äãare more interesting. <br><br>  I spent at least an hour a day writing an essay about myself that my girlfriend checked for errors.  When you meet other people, they ask the same things: ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow do you like France?‚Äù Memorizing ready-made answers give you the opportunity to quickly learn how to conduct a dialogue. <br><br>  Another good technique is the study of word fillers.  Speech is about words that do not matter, but which people say between sentences.  Something like ‚Äúreally‚Äù and so on. <br><br>  After 17 days in this village, I went to Paris.  I met a girl at a coffee shop and spoke to her.  A few minutes later she asked how long I had been in France.  She was surprised to learn that only 17 days I was in this country, and said that in my conversation she thought that I had been here for about a year. <br><br>  I hope these ways will help you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375127/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375127/</a></p>
