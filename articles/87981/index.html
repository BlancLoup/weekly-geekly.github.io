And also, because for the last 4 years I have been buying all the equipment through online stores. <br><br>  I will try to briefly describe the problems experienced by the buyer, getting to the point of issue of the goods. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Detailed map on the site.</b> <br>  The site should have a detailed map (better for a pedestrian and a motorist separately) on which all key points will be indicated (for example, " <i>turn at the Kopeyka shop to the right</i> " or "the <i>checkpoint is located in the courtyard of a red two-story house, it is better to bypass it with right side</i> "), resulting in the point of issue of the goods.  Often, companies only point out the route to the checkpoint - and in the office the buyer has to terrorize passersby and find out where the store is located. <br><br>  <b>Client - a separate room for customers.</b> <br>  Pickup from an online store, as a rule, comes from the main office, as there are no additional points of issue.  Therefore, getting into the office - the client gets into the clutter of the work of managers, couriers, operators and other employees. <br>  All this does not necessarily show the client.  Provide a separate room (albeit small), in which the client can sit quietly, wait for his manager. <br><br>  <b>Telephone in client or individual person dealing with incoming customers.</b> <br>  In the client must hang a phone number on which you can call the secretary, and find out when the manager will come.  It often happens that clients sit for 20-30 minutes waiting for the manager, and the manager does not even know that the client has come.  The same work can be done by an individual. <br><br>  <b>Tea / water in the client.</b> <br>  In the client must be a water cooler.  If you are selling expensive goods, then there should be a beautiful girl in the mini who will offer you tea or coffee to choose from. <br><br>  <b>Restroom.</b> <br>  From the client must have access to the toilet.  Moreover, the output should be "direct", i.e.  not going through the main hall with employees. <br>  The toilet should always be clean, it should be toilet paper. <br>  <i>Personally, I was always embarrassed when in a cramped room I asked the manager where the toilet was, he vaguely showed me with his hand in the direction of the open-space with the manager, after passing through which it was possible to find a toilet 3 times.</i> <br><br>  <b>Upsale.</b> <br>  While waiting for an order or documents, the client has nothing to do.  As a rule, he spends this time listening to music, reading a newspaper or picking his nose. <br>  Use this time to sell accessories or additional services.  Put advertising booklets on the tables and place a display case with accessories. <br>  As practice shows, such sales are very effective. <br><br>  It would seem simple rules - but in the vast majority of Moscow online stores they are ignored.  And there is little where I would like to come back for a new purchase. <br><br>  A certain amount is spent on customer acquisition.  Invest money in your item delivery point and you will invest money in customer retention, which will most likely be no more expensive than attracting a new customer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87981/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87981/</a></p>
