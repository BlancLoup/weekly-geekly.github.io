  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Non fiction. What to read?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to share with you a few of the non fiction books that have been read in recent years.  However, when making the list, an unexpected selection problem arose.  Books for a wide range of books, which are read into the air even by a completely unprepared reader and can compete with fiction books in the sense of a fascinating narrative.  Books for more thoughtful reading, to understand which will require a slight strain of the brain, and textbooks (collections of lectures), for students and those who want to more seriously sort out some issues.  This list presents exactly the first part - books for the widest possible range of readers (although this, of course, is very subjective).  I deliberately abandoned the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgiving my own description to the books and left original annotations even in those cases when they did not suit me in order not to influence the selection process for further reading.  As usual, if you want to add something to this list - welcome to the comments. <br><br><img align="right" alt="   " hspace="20" src="https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/not_blogger/16380394/72381/72381_300.jpg" title="How music became free">  1. <b>How music became free</b> [End of the record industry, technological upheaval and zero patient piracy] <br>  Author.  Stephen Witt <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúHow music became free‚Äù is a fascinating story in which obsession, greed, music, crime and money are intertwined.</i>  <i>This story is told through visionaries and criminals, magnates and teenagers, creating a new digital reality.</i>  <i>This is the story of the greatest pirate in history, the most influential music business leader, a revolutionary invention and an illegal website that was four times as large as the iTunes Music Store.</i> <i><br><a name="habracut"></a></i>  <i>Journalist Stephen Witt keeps track of the secret history of digital music piracy, starting with the invention of German mp3 audio engineers, guiding the reader through a plant in North Carolina where CDs were printed and about 2,000 albums were downloaded into the network over the decade to skyscrapers in Manhattan, whence the powerful Dag Morris, who monopolized the world market for rap music, ruled the music business, and from there into the depths of the Internet ‚Äî darknet.</i>
