  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Road to the clouds</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In 2009, Infobox refused to use OpenVZ technology to provide <a href="http://infobox.ru/vps/">virtual dedicated</a> server <a href="http://infobox.ru/vps/">services</a> and switched to using Microsoft's <a href="http://hyper-v.ru/">Hyper-V</a> technology. <br>  Why? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The reason for the transition is simple - HyperV, compared to OpenVZ, gives us the opportunity to provide customers with better services, because  It is an ‚Äúhonest‚Äù virtualization platform, that is, it imitates a computer for a virtual machine entirely, with all the necessary hardware (including, by the way, a BIOS).  This virtual machine runs a separate operating system kernel.  OpenVZ does not know how, since it is a paravirtualization platform, it uses resource allocation for each client, emulates a dedicated server, but uses a single, common core and emulation is clearly visible to the naked eye when working with this kind of system.  Thus, working with OpenVZ, the client was tied to the Linux kernel we used, although it could use the distributions we needed as the environment.  The new platform allows you to use any operating system designed for the Intel (x86) platform in the list of available operating systems for MS Windows of different versions, as well as various Linux distributions. <br><br>  But I would like to tell about this technology not only from the point of view of the UPU service, but also about other ways of using virtualization, including  and owners of physical dedicated servers.

      We use Hyper-V technology in at least two cases. <br><br>  First of all, it is still for the UPU service.  If we used to install separate servers for VPS clients with Linux and Windows, now they live perfectly on a common server.  There is a reduction in costs. <br>  Also, virtualization technology helps us to cost our internal services, to share resources between our applications, if earlier this required the deployment of several physical servers, now there is virtualization. <br><br>  But, if Hyper-V helps us, then it will help you too! <br>  You can put several virtual servers on one physical server and have independent resources.  I will give an example when we recommend using this technology. <br>  The physical server on which some services must run, for example, a couple of sites with their own databases, e-mail.  Sites are different, require different settings, they are managed by individuals.  Something can work under Windows OS, and something only works under Linux.  To solve the problem of optimizing the use of server resources, we use virtual dedicated servers based on Hyper-V.  In practice, this is done in the following way: MS Windows 2008 Server Standard is installed on a physical server with the Hyper-V role, as an option you can use the free MS Hyper-V Server.  With the help of Hyper-V, you can create the necessary clean virtual machines on which different operating systems are installed, the most suitable for solving your specific tasks. <br><br>  This separation helps both in resource sharing issues, i.e.  allocates guaranteed resources to different services, and solves some security issues, for example, the vulnerability in the site does not jeopardize all other resources.  In the worst case, attackers can get control of the server where the vulnerable resource is located.  For you, there is a great system recovery tool - snapshots, i.e.  snapshots that allow you to ‚Äúroll back‚Äù to the state of the virtual machine, corresponding to the moment of snapshot creation. <br><br>  Moreover, we use it ourselves and recommend virtualizing the server even if there is only one virtual machine on it.  What for?  For much easier transfer of data as an image in the case of migration from one physical server to another. <br>  By the way, all Microsoft sites are located on VPSah working on Hyper-V (right, colleagues?). <br><br>  If you believe many large companies, the future of hosting services will be cloudy, not in the sense that everything will be bad :), but in that all services will be in the cloud, to solve the problem, a piece of the cloud is allocated, a virtual machine that performs the required user task. <br><br>  Authors: Rustam Narmanov (technical director of Infobox), Pavel Rudnitsky (technical department specialist) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72393/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72393/</a></p>
