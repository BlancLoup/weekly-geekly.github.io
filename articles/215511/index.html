  <section class="page js-page"><h1>bb-mobile VOIIS GPS: a phone with large buttons, health control and remote control</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Personally, I have never particularly liked the classic concept of the ‚Äúgrandmother's phone‚Äù, which has gained some acceptance in the Russian market.  Yes, such devices have large buttons and large fonts, which is good.  But all the other functions in them, it seems, are implemented for a tick.  Radio without a headset?  Yes, it works.  But the antenna built into the case is so weak that it cannot receive an FM signal, and therefore, instead of music from the speaker, there is basically a rustling sound. <br><br>  SOS functionality?  Yes, the phone can call and send SMS to the assigned alarm numbers by pressing the corresponding button (usually it is located at the back).  But then what?  A person finds out that something happened to his elderly relative.  But only: where is he, that he is far from a fact that all this crucial information will reach the recipient.  Because this very elderly relative must pass it on to the "addressee" in a voice, and if he, for example, had a stroke, then he probably won't be able to do it.  All this is reminiscent of my school, where by the beginning of one academic year in the office of physics they installed taps on each desk.  Type for experiments.  But the pipes to them were ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù, and during the next three years of study we did not use these cranes even once.  It is the same with the ‚Äúgrandmothers‚Äù: the undertaking is sound and correct, but for some reason they don‚Äôt bring it to the bitter end. <br><br>  Below I will talk about the phone bb-mobile VOIIS GPS, in which everything is just done as it should.  And I would not call it ‚Äúgrandmother‚Äôs phone‚Äù in the usual sense - the definition of ‚Äúmedphone‚Äù is better suited to it, since it, among other things, allows you to remotely monitor the parameters of the user's health status.  This can be useful not only for an elderly person, but also, for example, a child.  I remember, at the age of 12, I went to a children's ‚Äúhealth-improving‚Äù camp.  I deliberately quoted the word ‚Äúwell-being‚Äù in quotation marks, because due to the wild lack of sanitation and poor nutrition, I ‚Äúcaught‚Äù some interesting virus there that caused high fever and stomach problems.  The caring parents gave me a thermometer with me, and I even used it a couple of times for its intended purpose.  But at the age of 12, you don‚Äôt think that 38 degrees is somehow too much.  The main thing - the sun, sea, sand ... So I fell ill then well.  But if I had bb-mobile VOIIS GPS in my pocket, and in my head there was the right instruction from my parents, then, having learned about the problems with the temperature, they would have taken me out of this place in a matter of hours.

What is bb-mobile VOIIS GPS?  It looks like a regular phone, resembling the appearance of "grandmothers".  In essence, this is a complex client-server system, which allows you to remotely monitor your health settings and configure your phone ‚Äúfrom and to‚Äù.  What is more important - control of the state of the organism or adjustment - I do not venture to judge: in my opinion, both of these options are key in this case, and we should not consider any of them as additional or secondary. <br><br>  I won‚Äôt talk about the phone itself for a long time.  It has large and comfortable buttons, a fairly nice plastic case (there are silver elements, there are black with a spark), a small but rather high-quality color screen, FM radio ... For the latter, a retractable telescopic antenna is provided, so that the reception quality no complaints - all honor to honor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/634/2f3/990/6342f399088704b2fc28c110cdb02e6c.jpg"><br><br>  In the menu there is an item where you can check the weather for the current location. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0fd/e2a/44d/0fde2a44d628aad37931a2bf7859a7e7.jpg"><br><br>  In the upper part of the case there is an eyelet for fastening the lace (included in the kit) and an LED flashlight.  It is activated by a slider located on the right side of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d9/825/04f/5d982504ff3012b25d6760754cdae898.jpg"><br><br>  The SOS button is located on the back panel (I‚Äôll stress at once that its capabilities are much wider than those of the ‚Äúgrandmothers), as well as a really loud speaker.  I would even say "deafeningly loud." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/788/542/f1d/788542f1d1e3b01983971a7b190664e1.jpg"><br><br>  Under the battery, there was a slot for a SIM card (miniSIM standard, although microSIM can be inserted into it without any problems) and microSD flash drives.  Frankly speaking, I didn‚Äôt quite understand why I needed the last one, because there is no music player and camera in bb-mobile VOIIS GPS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ee/010/076/0ee010076759ff8c8cd0d9f52c68d362.jpg"><br><br>  Perhaps, I will immediately tell you about the SOS key and the possibilities associated with it.  Yes, after clicking on this button, bb-mobile VOIIS GPS can turn on the ‚Äúsiren‚Äù (and you can really hear it well - see the speaker‚Äôs impressions above), call the specified numbers (up to 5 pieces) and send SMS to them. <br><br>  And here it is worth paying attention to the abbreviation GPS, which is present in the name of the phone and is shown on its case.  The fact is that the message text may include a link to the map where the location of the user will be indicated.  Moreover, such a message can be sent not only after pressing the SOS key, but also requested by the ‚Äúremote controller‚Äù, that is, for example, relatives of the owner of bb-mobile VOIIS GPS.  You send the word FIND to his number, and two messages come back in a couple of minutes.  The first is with the coordinates calculated from the operator‚Äôs base stations.  The second will contain GPS coordinates and a link to Google Maps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bdc/7da/ccd/bdc7daccd78b5bc465ed260fd5276e6e.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/045/ab1/2ff/045ab12ff40475d456e918642466e79f.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/178/b91/1ae/178b911aeaa27d48e8d854949e0048bb.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a4e/5f9/e5d/a4e5f9e5de4af0907dca3f0ea9903e97.png"><br><br>  Convenient implementation?  In my opinion, very comfortable and correct. <br><br>  Regarding health monitoring and remote settings.  For these purposes, the service is located at <a href="http://www.bb-mobile.ru/voois/">www.bb-mobile.ru/voois</a> .  The password is listed on the phone itself, and the IMEI number should be entered as the login.  After that, this menu opens: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/685/6a2/124/6856a212494a7aeb7fb4729e7289d59f.png"><br><br>  You can literally adjust everything.  That is almost any parameter of the phone.  Want to change the wallpaper?  You are welcome.  Change pictures to photo contacts (there can be 8 of them + 300 ordinary, without a picture), and also set ringtones for them?  No problem.  Time, date, key lock, turn on the flashlight, sound volume - all this can be adjusted and adjusted.  What is it for?  I think many people have come across a situation where your mom or grandmother calls you and says something like, ‚Äúoh, I‚Äôve done something here, and now the phone doesn‚Äôt squeak when calling.‚Äù  Using a browser on a computer or smartphone, you can solve this problem instantly.  Or, for example, add the doctor's number to the memory of the device.  It is more convenient that to dictate to the user, so that he himself ‚Äúhammered‚Äù him into the phone. <br><br>  So, I, for example, added my number to the memory of bb-mobile VOIIS GPS, accompanying it with a picture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e5e/4bc/dab/e5e4bcdab1263d480aa920b01cce43c0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c2d/fef/bd7/c2dfefbd78927423bef23cfb543a50af.jpg"><br><br>  To order a couple more screenshots showing the breadth of remote configuration options: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e0/dd0/719/9e0dd0719af059eb5993e0dcf8ae495e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c2/86c/887/5c286c8877f9e748ab254787e9afa80b.jpg"><br><br>  There are two options for synchronizing the phone with the bb-mobile server - both of them are described both in the manual and on the website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f79/d43/e98/f79d43e98f899ec2f74583650bd1cd43.jpg"><br><br>  The first one is completely ‚Äúmanual‚Äù: the user must click on the ‚ÄúSynchronize‚Äù item in the phone interface.  This is useful if you need to upload information about the state of the body made to bb-mobile VOIIS GPS to the server (I will discuss this option below).  However, you can synchronize both manually and on schedule - once a day or once a week. <br><br>  The second option, again, is remote: relatives can send a message with the word SYNC to bb-mobile VOIIS GPS, and all changes in the settings will be downloaded from the server to the phone without user intervention.  Although, of course, this option can be activated even if the user regularly enters data on the state of the body into the phone, but forgets to regularly synchronize them with the server. <br><br>  Actually, about health control.  From the phone you can make the following settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e17/fd4/50c/e17fd450c2afe2c9db47cef78d98a116.jpg"><br><br>  That is, the user enters them into bb-mobile VOIIS GPS at any frequency (at least once a minute, at least once a day, although once a week), they are transmitted to a server, where something like this is built.  I experimented with Temperature.  At first I indicated that I have it equal to 36.6 degrees, and then - 36.8.  (You can view charts / health data for a day, a week, a month, and even a year.) Relatives can follow the changes on the site and, if something happens, take action.  The main thing is to teach the user to regularly enter data and not to forget about synchronization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/949/7ee/fcb/9497eefcbf7fee9540fa7637d0fd5ef4.jpg"><br><br>  However, if the user is forgetful, then you can remotely activate up to 13 alarms for different times.  One of them is a regular alarm clock, and 12 are reminders.  With their help, you can be reminded of the need to drink medicine, as well as the need to enter health parameters in your phone - blood pressure, pulse, blood sugar, oxygen in the blood, weight, temperature, number of steps.  For each of them, you can set a threshold value;  for example, for a temperature we enter 36.6 gardusa, and if the user enters 37 after the ‚Äúreminder‚Äù has been triggered, then bb-mobile VOIIS GPS will immediately inform the relatives via SMS.  Again, I note that the idea, in my opinion, is excellent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf2/496/7ca/cf24967ca442b373aff001a131ab8910.png"><br><br>  You can also specify drugs that are allergic to a person, set some general information and enter an extract from the medical card (800 characters for each item).  All this is done to demonstrate to doctors and nurses in case of contact with the hospital. <br><br>  A very unusual (and useful) option was found on the phone: bb-mobile VOIIS GPS can receive calls from 5 emergency numbers even when the phone is turned off.  Thus, a person can be reached in case he accidentally / unknowingly turned off the device.  Turn it off, by the way, can be on schedule - for example, at the time of daily rest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f0/e15/ed0/5f0e15ed0e33b6c9a0a02566369bca08.jpg"><br><br>  The device, of course, works somewhat less than the usual ‚Äúgrandmother's phones‚Äù - due to the connection to the Internet and the periodic GPS operation.  Nevertheless, the 900 mAh battery guarantees up to 5-7 days of "autonomous".  And in order that the user does not forget about the podzardyak, you can set a reminder (including remotely).  The phone is charged via the microUSB port, however, the delivery kit also includes a desktop cradle.  Convenient thing, do not need to "look for" the jack for the plug on the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/962/173/45f/96217345fe17bde0abd0a2fb12287060.jpg"><br><br>  What can I say in the end?  Excellent "complex" turned out, in my opinion.  He has two drawbacks.  The first is a certain difficulty in mastering and tuning.  This is a product for users who realize why they and their loved ones need such a device and who will spend several hours / days setting it up.  Perhaps this will have to involve representatives of the younger generation - those who are able to deal with a modern smartphone.  The second drawback or, if you wish, a nuance is the need to train the user to make the body parameters strictly on schedule.  It‚Äôs not a fact that a person far from gadgets will cope with this instantly and on the first attempt. <br><br>  It is worth bb-mobile VOIIS GPS 3 490 rubles.  That is quite acceptable.  Also on sale is the phone bb-mobile VOIIS Comfort - the essence is the same, but in a folding form factor, with a larger screen and without GPS (location is determined by base stations).  Its price is 3,790 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aae/197/40a/aae19740a62ea093b14882432f470746.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d9/389/aec/1d9389aec86eebed48516f287c3b5cbe.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d01/338/50b/d0133850b51b2a16707365bf60227be8.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/215511/">https://habr.com/ru/post/215511/</a></p>
