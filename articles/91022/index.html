  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Version 1.1.0 released</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://www.webogroup.com/home/site-speedup/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f45/8c0/be6/f458c0be6e20bd75e98ba087e7db23d3.png" align="right"></a>  For almost two months after the official release of the first version of the application for automatic acceleration of sites - WEBO Site SpeedUp - we have not written anything about innovations, improvements and bug fixes.  But this does not mean that it was not.  Just decided not to bother the community on trifles, and roll it all at once. <br><br>  About the product: <a href="http://www.webogroup.com/home/site-speedup/">www.webogroup.com/home/site-speedup</a> <br>  Download: <a href="http://www.webogroup.com/home/download/">www.webogroup.com/home/download</a> <br><br><h3>  What's new? </h3><a name="habracut"></a><ul><li>  The most significant addition to this version of the product is achievements (or awards), the result of site optimization is a five-part rocket, which denote certain components of a fast site.  With an increase in the download speed of the site, the rocket becomes more ‚Äúcool‚Äù (from background to paper, then wooden, and finally, metal).  If some part of the site does not work fast enough (many files, or as a result of acceleration, the size was reduced slightly), then the improvement is not fixed in this direction.  All performance measurements are made using the service <a href="http://webo.in/">webo.in.</a>  In the very near future, the concept will be refined to make getting new levels clearer and easier.  The final rocket is created as a picture on the site itself + a page appears ( <a href="http://www.speedingupwebsite.com/web-optimizer/cache/webo-site-speedup.php">for example, like this</a> ) with its description, a rocket and a link to this page can be shared with friends :) </li><li>  Before the release of version 1.0, we conducted usability testing for already familiar (or made familiar as a result of testing) users.  There were a lot of small points to improve + for two months, we actively collected feedback on the use of the product.  All this is reflected in the significantly modified interface: it has more tips, small ryushechek and less distracting details.  We hope that all the improvements have been carried out in place. </li><li>  One of the most significant technological improvements was the introduction of HTML sprites (combining small HTML images using CSS Sprites, <a href="http://blog.webogroup.com/2010/02/html-sprites-silver-bullet-against.html">note in English</a> ).  Now the number of objects on the page can be reduced even more. </li><li>  Also, the logic of determining Apache modules has been revised (for CGI environments, the situation has been significantly improved), the memory allocation for CSS Sprites has been revised (reduced by 20-50%), the overall performance of the product has been slightly increased. </li><li>  Yes, now, to familiarize with WEBO Site SpeedUp, you can automatically receive a test key from the ‚ÄúPersonal data‚Äù page for 14 days (as many as half a month of free website acceleration!). </li><li>  Added a setting for ‚Äúsecure‚Äù ( <a href="http://webo.in/articles/habrahabr/112-minify-combine-javascript-troubles/">through the try-catch construct</a> with an external file connected) of the javascript merge logic. </li><li>  Added Social Engine to supported systems. </li></ul>

    <h3>  Extra buns </h3><br><ul><li>  A <a href="http://www.webogroup.com/ru/home/site-speedup-joomla/video/">number of screencasts were written to customize the product</a> (for a plug-in for Joomla!, But for other systems, the actions are almost the same). </li><li>  <a href="http://www.webogroup.com/ru/home/offers/">There is a promotional campaign</a> for which you can receive a product for free (if you achieve with it a significant acceleration of the site).  Unfortunately, the contest of speeding up sites has already ended. The prizes have found their heroes. </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.webogroup.com/2010/04/new-design-for-user-guide.html">New design</a> for user documentation. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  The situation with Bitrix </h3><br>  As a result of an oversight for two weeks in the partner repository of Bitrix (and not on the official site) there was an incorrect version of the product, which in some cases made the site inaccessible after installation.  <a href="http://dev.1c-bitrix.ru/community/blogs/rsv-dev/1732.php" rel="nofollow">The situation has received a significant response</a> , and we officially apologize for any inconvenience.  In order to rehabilitate the product image as an ideal solution to speed up sites (and demonstrate its full functionality), we are ready to provide free product customization services for the Bitrix platform during this April.  Please contact <a href="">support@webo.name</a> . <br><br><h3>  Soon </h3><br>  As usual, we have a lot of plans: we will continue to work on the product in two directions.  First, the current interface and the product setup process will be simplified as much as possible (to reduce the site acceleration, if not for 1 click, then a maximum of 5).  Secondly, we will expand the functionality and compatibility in accordance with the wishes of advanced users (in particular, more complete support for CDN, code minimization tools and compatibility with caching subsystems will be added). <br><br>  + Naturally, we are working on the correct (and the fastest, of course) server caching logic for the most popular platforms.  The appearance is expected until the summer of this year, I do not want to roll out the raw solution. <br><br>  In general, as usual: we work to make your sites faster. <br><br>  Official website: <a href="http://www.webogroup.com/">www.webogroup.com</a> <br><br>  PS in secret: in the coming days it is planned to distribute corporate T-shirts ( <a href="" rel="nofollow">front view, rear</a> <a href="" rel="nofollow">take-off area</a> , <a href="http://twitpic.com/1de461/full" rel="nofollow">white and black</a> ) to WEBO Site SpeedUp buyers, stay tuned :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91022/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91022/</a></p>
