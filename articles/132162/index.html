We have had model 119 for 2 years. It is now obsolete, not so much technically as morally.  And technically, probably, too - because there is a 600 MHz processor and Android 2.1.  But we did not remove it from production, as the demand for it was fairly steady.  Where did this demand come from, although there are newer models?  As it turned out, there are a large number of people willing to buy ‚Äújust an inexpensive tablet model‚Äù ‚Äîfor simple tasks ‚Äî for reading, kin, etc.  But, unfortunately, Android 2.1 today can not arrange it, because it does not have a flash - And what is a flashless Internet today?  You can‚Äôt see the video, except maybe YouTube, which has a special application, and the rest do not fully go without a flash.  Another disadvantage of Android 2.1 is the inability to start and install applications on the card from the card.  It means that the volume of the device‚Äôs own memory becomes critical.  Memory expansion is a significant increase in price, which is unacceptable for a cheap model.  Moreover, the flash drive is much cheaper. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20b/954/193/20b9541938a594351658971279295154.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Screen.  As it turned out, the resistive screen is not the most critical, especially with a stylus.  Because, usually cheap models are used for the Internet.  Since scaling and so on are needed as far as possible - an double-touch is enough to enlarge / reduce the image or page.  And some games, for example the same races, are even better on a resistive screen.  :) Therefore, we have released 117 model - it has a double-touch screen, but it is modern very fast - the reaction speed is very high.  But we made a very fast processor in this model - it is Rocchip 1.2 GHz.  All the most advanced applications go easy, without tension (birds go easy).  Plus we added a camera here.  Google services are all great here. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/780/c90/333/780c903339e1952e5d72e14a7cc8bb68.jpg" alt="image">

      This device - usually used by students, schoolchildren - because inexpensive.  In the new model, we added a full-fledged YUSB-plug.  Since the users of this device basically carry all the information on flash drives, but where should I insert the flash drive?  - therefore need a connector.  Or another 3G is also always needed. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/96b/68c/98b/96b68c98b426c9760aa4d034a8ebdfd7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another added HDMA output.  Thanks to a powerful processor and a graphical coprocessor, this inexpensive model allows you to play in HD-quality and play streaming video on a large screen - which is also important.  You can shoot a shot from a flash drive on the big screen. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da9/07e/945/da907e945bf5dde795dc7d330c155fd4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The model turned out to be quite inexpensive, considering that it has one of the most up-to-date processors and characteristics: RAM, etc. So the offer on the market for such devices is attractive. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/710/41f/9a9/71041f9a9b4463893cb7105e82ee8495.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another plus.  Especially for this model redesigned its interface, designed for an inexperienced user.  All the programs that are installed are displayed with icons on the main screen.  What is this for?  It is calculated either on an inexperienced or on a young user. <br><br>  This device is usually the first among mobile tablets - the price is low.  People often take "to see."  Therefore, we believe that such an organization of the desktop will be optimal - a person immediately sees what is. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ee/148/b6b/8ee148b6bc527a91a53cf98dd1f81747.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you remove the water - the main task of this model was: fit in the lowest price - up to 150-200 dollars. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132162/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132162/</a></p>
