The recording itself took place in January.  And now the people who were selected came to confirm. <br><br>  Some people asked questions and talked in comments, others preferred to write questions to me personally.  But I am sure that the majority simply quietly sent the documents without telling anyone.  I would like to use the date of confirmation of the record and count the readers who sent the documents and those who received a positive response. <br><br>  Just answer the questions of one of those who signed up, the information may be of interest to others.  I invite everyone to join the discussion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will not reveal his identity, I do not know whether he wants to advertise his plans for departure.

    <blockquote>  ... they answered me from the university and sent me an invitation, but there are a couple of nuances that I don‚Äôt have to clarify and would be very grateful if you answered.  The invitation states that on September 16 and 17, tests will be taken for enrollment, trying to find information for tests and what level of French is needed for passing (in my case, French is almost zero) and what language is taught?  and the last question is whether the visa will be issued to the spouse and can she travel with me, and what should be the amount on the account that would open a visa (cost of living)?  The last questions for the most part relate to the consulate ... </blockquote><br><br>  Congratulations!  Actually from this message I learned that the recording is over. <br>  If you have not received confirmation today, you will most likely not receive it.  Try next year. <br><br>  There is no need to be afraid of tests.  They do not aim to weed out anyone, but determine which year of study and which group you will be recorded in. <br>  Personally, I arrived with zero knowledge of French.  In the test answered at random, did not even try to get into the correct answers.  Accordingly, I was enrolled in the first course in the weakest group, which suited me perfectly. <br><br>  Teaching comes in french.  But at the first stage, sign language is actively used, so do not worry. <br><br>  On a visa, information could become outdated, but in my time it was like this: the embassy issued a student visa for 3 months, and after being registered at the university, the prefecture in Toulouse already issued a student residence permit for a year already.  Then it is extended annually in the prefecture of the place of residence (you can easily change the university and move to another region). <br><br>  On a visa for a spouse, it seems to me that it is better to go alone, and already have to worry about her documents when the annual ‚Äúresidence permit‚Äù is received.  This will also reduce the amount of money needed in the account.  I don‚Äôt remember how much money I need, therefore I urge knowledgeable people to share relevant information. <br><br>  There are probably many more questions for those who signed up and just interested.  Let's try to answer them. <br><br>  <b>update</b> : <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/kakawajazz/" class="user_link">kakawajazz</a> : Salute. <br>  For statistics: <br>  I just took out the letter of refusal from the box today. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  HOUSING: </h4>  The housing situation in Toulouse is not easy.  Accommodation expensive, wanting a lot.  Therefore, I recommend visitors to pay attention to the "colocaton" - the joint removal of housing.  It is better to take care of this as soon as possible - the closer to September, the more willing there will be.  Recorded on the defila from the habr, you can try to cooperate with each other.  If you want, write to me, I will give you the contacts of other future students. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225139/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225139/</a></p>
