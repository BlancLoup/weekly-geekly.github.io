Actually, everything would be fine, because so far the players have mastered a not so much of the gaming space (according to the developers, there are about 400,000,000,000 stars).  Actually, the same developers have previously reported that in the course of the game unusual things will be revealed and strange objects will appear to the newly-minted star navigators.  But since the middle of last year, the strange and the unusual has become even more than before. <br><br>  Unidentified objects ("unknown artifacts") have been encountered by players for many months.  Unknown probes ‚Äúunknown probes‚Äù appeared in the game).  When trying to study such a probe, the gamer's ship begins to glow, after which all systems turn off until the probe is removed for a certain distance.  Plus, these systems also send some message from which you can select a schematic image of something that resembles a planet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c9/4fa/802/1c94fa8024d23145b4e0b3883e91a456.jpg">

      All this has <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/278780/">been</a> previously <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/278780/">reported</a> .  Some gamers perceive the incident as a direct indication of the imminent intrusion of the Thargoids.  These creatures are taller than humans, their language can hardly be deciphered, they themselves are a half-legend. <br><br>  Now began to appear the first evidence that the invasion could really happen.  Unusual ships appeared in the game that belong to an unknown race (to the targoids or not - it is not clear yet).  But these ships are different from everything seen by the players before.  The ships are rather large, symmetrical, equipped with unknown sources of energy and a number of incomprehensible tools. <br><br>  The first gamer who encountered these objects was the owner of the Xbox One <a href="http://xboxdvr.com/gamer/DP%2520Sayre/videos">DP Sayre</a> .  These videos are hardly fakes, since posting videos on the Xbox DVR is more difficult than just posting something on YouTube.  By the way, several clips appeared on this service, showing unknown ships. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/slbWLXIpCv8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The user who posted the video believes that it was a meeting with the targoids.  By the way, the encountered ship resembles an apparatus that crashed against one and the planets and was discovered by players in August last year. <br><br>  The meeting brought a lot of unexpected.  After the player came out of hyperspace (or rather, it seems that he was taken out of there), the alien ship came very close and performed some actions.  What he did is incomprehensible.  But at this time the ship of the gamer remained motionless and earned only after the ‚Äúaliens‚Äù left home. <br><br>  Some gamers tried to attack outsiders, but they did not succeed - even if the attack was carried out using modified weapons. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VVdZMB9UAAo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Unfortunately, so far what is happening, we can only speculate.  If these are really targoids, then gamers can be prepared for war - after all, a meeting with these creatures does not bode well.  Developers change the essence and line of behavior of the targoids from <a href="http://www.drewwagar.com/progress-report/elite-dangerous-lore-the-thargoids/">game to game</a> , but one thing remains constant.  They are always mysterious, always powerful and always dangerous. <br><br>  What does this mean for the game?  Will there be a massive invasion from a neighboring (or not neighboring) galaxy?  What do players do?  Nothing is clear.  And the developers, as always, keep secrets and do not give out any details.  After rumors began to appear massively that Elite: Dangerous had ‚Äústrangers‚Äù, the developers literally stated the following: ‚ÄúWe are now studying information about unusual encounters among Elite: Dangerous, but we cannot comment on galactic rumors and speculations‚Äù .  Well, nothing can be done, you have to wait. <br><br>  The game is still in development, although in this status could become very popular.  The storyline, the one to which gamers are accustomed to other games, is not here.  More precisely, there is a certain plot, but it is far from linear, but dynamic.  The advantage of all this is that developers manage to throw in more and more new surprises that gamers like so much. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400587/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400587/</a></p>
