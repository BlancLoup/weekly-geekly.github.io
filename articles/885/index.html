And this process, whatever one may say, is moving more and more in the direction of increasing the information flow, and also involves more and more people.  I am not inclined to say here that ‚Äúeverything will be in the virtual and life will disappear!‚Äù, This, in my opinion, is absolute nonsense.  Virtualization is only partially possible - at least as long as <habracut>  Nanotechnologies will not learn how to instantly produce the most complex structures such as the human body, and machines - to carry the mind.  I think <strong>this is</strong> still very far away. <br><br>  Here are some <a href="http://www.membrana.ru/lenta/%3F6346">things</a> to think about: working with memory. <br>  And one more <a href="http://www.membrana.ru/articles/technic/2004/10/22/212800.html">thing</a> : the electronic hippocampus. <br>  More information about <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/1854">false memories</a> .

      Excerpts: <br>  - <font><i>"... scientists managed to erase long-term memories in rats, in the process getting a lot of information about what changes in the brain occurred.</i></font> <font><i><br></i></font>  <font><i>... learned to suppress in it the connections of synapses connecting brain neurons by means of an injection of a chemical called ZIP.</i></font> <font><i><br></i></font>  <font><i>Trained to avoid dangerous (shock) places rats after the injection forgot about their skills.</i></font>  <font><i>However, this ‚Äúerasure‚Äù did not at all affect the work of their short-term memory, and, moreover, did not interfere with the formation of long-term memories in the future.</i></font>  <font><i>Only past memories were deleted "...</i></font> <font><br></font>  <font>- <i>... Drawing an analogy with a computer, one can say that the hippocampus is a chip of the north and south bridges, as well as their data buses interconnecting the central processor, RAM and permanent memory.</i></font> <font><i><br></i></font>  <font><i>Theodore Berger (Theodore Berger), director of the Center for Neural Engineering (Center for Neural Engineering) University of Southern California (University of Southern California) ... ... intends to create a microchip that ... could serve as the hippocampus.</i></font> <font><i><br><br></i></font>  <font><i>... the computer was able to calculate all the mathematical functions that the rat hippocampus was performing with neural signals.</i></font> <font><i><br></i></font>  <font><i>According to the authors of the work - this is the key to all memory.</i></font>  <font><i>They created a chip that reproduced the work of the rat hippocampus with an accuracy of 95%.</i></font> <font><i><br></i></font>  <font><i>In fact, the team came close to the next stage of the experiment - the introduction of the electronic hippocampus in live rats.</i></font> <font><br></font>  <font>- <i>... Two versions of the site were shown to two groups of respondents ... There were static photos on one site and an interactive demonstration on the other, which allowed the camera to be turned from all sides.</i></font>  <font><i>After that, the "experimental" were asked to indicate which of the ten listed functions the camera had.</i></font> <font><i><a name="habracut"></a></i></font>  <font><i>Among the answer options offered seven real and three "fake", that is, non-existent, function.</i></font>  <font><i>So, the group of users who worked with an interactive picture, more often called these "fake" details.</i></font>  <font><i>That is, in their eyes the camera had more functionality than in reality.</i></font> <font><i><br></i></font>  <font><i>The explanation may lie in the fact that the interactivity has a stronger effect on the imagination and involves more brain areas, due to which there is a ‚Äúnoise‚Äù in the form of fake memories.</i></font> <br><br>  But, nevertheless, virtualization is moving faster.  For example, it will soon be possible to get rid of the wires completely.  You can find out about it <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/1176">here</a> : <br>  <font><i>... Google recently introduced a special mobile version of Google Maps with reduced traffic consumption and a special kilobyte counter in real time.</i></font> <font><i><br></i></font>  <font><i>... Roughly the same will have to be done by other creators of Web 2.0 services if they want to enter the billion-dollar army of mobile phone owners.</i></font> <cut> <font><i><br></i></font>  <font><i>One of the options for switching to a mobile platform is a partial rejection of the universal browser, and instead the release of a special client software.</i></font> <font><i><br></i></font>  <font><i>... According to experts, in the very near future, many owners of Web 2.0 services will wake up interest in mobile users, and we will see significant progress in this direction.</i></font>  <font><i>Perhaps there will even be fundamentally new Web 2.0 services that will take advantage of mobile devices, for example, location information, as well as the constant presence of the device next to the user 24 hours a day.</i></font>  <font><i>Maybe it will be Web 3.0 already?</i></font> <br><br>  When we get rid of the wires, many providers will collapse.  But this process is logical.  And I think that the further we move in the direction of the wireless infosphere, the cheaper the traffic will be.  As an example, you can look at the Internet: at the dawn of its formation, a simple modem cost half a thousand dollars, and a megabyte of traffic could pull up to 3-5 dollars. <br>  True, it consumed much less. <br><br>  Now they often sell unlimited: that is, the specific cost is getting closer to zero.  I'm even at 512 kilobits can swing around the clock.  This is 512 kbit * 86400 * 30 = 165 888 million bytes, or 154.5 GB!  In the limit, of course. <br>  For a month I pay 750 rubles.  What we see?  We see about 5 rubles per gigabyte. <br>  And it was - at current prices - 133,120. The price has fallen 26,000 times !!! <br>  It will be exactly the same with mobile traffic - as soon as 3.5 G starts ... And the infrastructure update is already proceeding slowly. <br><br>  So we digitize. <br>  The society will be very interesting ... It is impossible to lie (tracking systems of lies can easily track this business), but to share fake memories is easy! <br>  Very interesting ... Indeed, it looks like F. Dick. </cut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/885/">https://habr.com/ru/post/885/</a></p>
