Children in need were also given computers and held home free internet.  All this can be found in the article on the website of the channel.

      Obviously, this is a terrific achievement for the education system, both in North Ossetia and in the whole country;  quietly, as it was with the introduction of open source software, just took and made good, good and useful. <br><br>  However, there is something that made me choke on morning tea while watching the news: the Macs were given to the children! <br><br>  Imagine: the Caucasus, the mountains, the village, the hut, and in it - the child behind the Mac! <br>  Even kill, but this move I absolutely can not understand!  Perhaps one such Mack costs as the annual salary of half of the population of the village.  Why is he a child?  Spin the ‚ÄúLearn Playing‚Äù CD and watch the teacher on Skype? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I do not want to seem like an ardent fan of poppies, who feel sorry for the wonderful machines for Ossetian children.  On the contrary, I am completely indifferent to them, Mac is a good thing for a certain range of tasks, but, in my opinion, buying it as a replacement for an ordinary office computer is luxury and foppery.  Why does it seem to me that the same money could have been spent on more reasonable assistance to children with disabilities?  Or do they have enough motorized wheelchairs, medicines, social assistants, and more, there‚Äôs no place to put money at all?  Oh, I do not believe, I'm sorry. <br><br>  Or is it a property of the local national mentality - if the computer is Mac then the gun is golden?  Then I have no questions, it‚Äôs not for me to judge the foundations of another nation.  If the reason is something else - then this is a complete ales. <br>  Unfortunately, on the Vesti site, the video story does not open diligently, but I saw it on TV.  And it is a pity, in the video you can see some interesting points. <br><br>  At first, they show us a satisfied girl behind Mack at home.  Then - happy boy.  He, too, Mack, but for some reason did not have enough monitors, he uses a cheap office "tag".  Here it is not at all clear what the bonus from the Mac is without quality color reproduction. <br>  Next, the camera casually runs over the training disc.  I did not have time to see the name, but I noticed an inscription on the corner of the box: ‚ÄúFor Windows and Mac‚Äù.  The thought that flashed through my head ‚Äúmaybe they just have some kind of special software for which Macs are vitally necessary?‚Äù Is broken into small pieces. <br><br>  This story leaves more questions than answers.  No pump, typical of the theme of the computerization of schools is not noticeable, nanotechnology and Petrik - too.  The only thing that comes to mind is that someone will soon wake up, will remember about the sensational government requirements for school computers that are suitable for machines exclusively with Windows, and quickly write down new Macs <em>where necessary</em> . <br><br>  I really want to hear the opinion of the Haboobrokaschestva, I can‚Äôt summarize the story myself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87048/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87048/</a></p>
