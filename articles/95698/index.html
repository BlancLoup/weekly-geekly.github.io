More precisely, from the iPhone there is only a part of the menu design and appearance. <br><br>  His name is SciPhone i9 +++.  The device was ordered by my friend directly from Chinatown.  Cost - 71 USD  together with the shipment.  On the customs label the shipping cost is 25 USD. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/66/4f/664f8fc4590f52feb303e13772a95ee1.jpg" alt="Box with device">

      In general, I begged this child to play around a bit.  What I want to tell now. <br><br>  Perhaps I'll start with the general characteristics. <br><br>  The device is designed as a monoblock with a built-in antenna, apparently it is almost a copy of the iPhone 3G.  True screen a little less.  And the positions of the Home button and the dynamics are similar, although there are differences in a couple of millimeters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/40/3a/403abdf23a965d02c4b3466542fb2278.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The assembly is pretty good, there are no slots, the case does not creak.  And, as practice has shown, pretty durable.  As it turned out later, there is a steel insert-rim between the back cover and the front panel, most likely it is covered with nickel. <br><br>  Judging by some reports, the percentage works at a frequency of about 60 MHz, which is not so much.  The amount of working memory barely reaches 2 MB.  However, it is possible to install microSD / TF cards up to 8 GB, although I set up 2 GB for the sake of experiment - it all worked. <br><br>  This child weighs about 135 grams, which is basically a lot, although the device is confidently held in his hand.  Dimensions are 116 x 62 x 13 mm.  The back cover is made of plastic.  With a hole under the camera at 0.3 megapixels, which in turn removes frankly just terrible. <br><br>  The phone is able to work simultaneously with two SIM-cards in GSM 850/900/1800/1900 networks.  I tried to put 2 cards at the same time - no matter how strange everything works.  I was surprised and at the same time pleased that it is possible to flexibly configure many parameters for each card separately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/02/58/0258d8af932f26efce36a39428f6080e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Information output is carried out on a 3.2 inch screen with a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels with the ability to display 256 thousand colors.  The touch screen and in addition to the standard "fingers" and responds to the stylus, which comes as part of the package. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/80/94/8094bf89c8a91399c175ebf3ebaf7c77.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e8/c6/e8c6c9cf0309d5dd1d51a0ef4471e7d2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To my great surprise, even a Bluetooth 2.0 module was present in this phone, which at the same time worked correctly. <br><br>  The phone came with two Li-Ion batteries for as much as 1800 mAh.  Is it possible to believe this figure I do not know, but with quite active calls, the device lives for 3 days. <br><br>  Charging is carried out either via USB, or through the power supply unit that comes in the kit and is designed for a 220V network ‚Äúnative‚Äù to us.  True, the connector on the phone itself does not cause much confidence. <br><br>  The set also comes with a stereo headset with a microphone, the quality is frankly speaking, both the sound and the assembly want the best. <br><br>  In the phone box, we managed to detect as many as 6 protective films for the front panel.  The films are not of the first quality, but they perform their function well, I immediately applied one to the device. <br><br>  Unlocking is done by moving the slider, like on the iPhone.  Further we get to the six-page menu.  2 pages is a useful menu so to speak, the remaining 4 are any Chinese garbage, some java applications. <br><br>  The screen itself is still quite sensitive, but the performance of the installed chip is too small and makes itself felt - in places it feels like the device is ‚Äúthinking a little‚Äù.  Although when dialing and entering SMS it does not appear. <br><br>  The phone supports several languages, including Russian, though there are blunders, for example, ‚ÄúSurrender‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúWaiting‚Äù - is it OK or just an illiterate translation? <br><br>  There is support for GPRS (class 10) and WAP 2.0.  There are SMS and MMS - this, however, and not surprised. <br><br>  Pretty convenient scribe, organizer, calendar.  Up to 5 alarm groups can be set at the same time.  There is a power saving mode - you can set up to 5 time intervals when the device will turn itself off and on - for example, at night. <br><br>  The accelerometer and the position sensor are also built in - the tracks and photos, as well as the screensavers can be changed by shaking, and the photos turn upside down when the position is changed horizontally / vertically. <br><br>  There is Java, therefore it is easy to install additional applications.  Portable Opera, Jimm, the mobile version of GMaps, and Skype got up without any problems. <br><br>  I almost forgot.  Among the standard programs there is even an E-book TXT reader that supports ASCII / Windows, Unicode, UTF8.  However, the mp3-player also works correctly with the Russian language. <br><br>  Of the basic features, there is a calculator, a voice recorder, a world clock, and the ability to play mp3.  Built even FM-receiver.  I'm just amazed from the Chinese, how much they just shoved into it for the price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/73/84/7384bd225046822d013bd20bda7620ab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c9/4a/c94a8b7ac8546cb826817a2fa9ba7459.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  These are the fakes that can be collected by the Chinese for as little as 70 US dollars (including delivery). <br><br><h6>  So what pleased </h6><br>  - good readable screen <br>  - independent work with two SIM-kami at the same time <br>  - support for memory cards up to 8 GB <br>  - good design, but here Jobs's merit <br>  - not bad PDA-functional <br>  - ridiculous price, a little more than 70 USD with delivery from China <br><br><h6>  And as always a spoon of tar </h6><br>  - weak processor, which sometimes makes itself felt <br>  - built-in camera is rare r **** and its meaning is not clear <br>  - lack of mini-jack 3.5 and standard mini-USB <br>  - pinout of the firmware cable for all batches is different, so it is inconvenient to flash <br><br>  Of course, he can not compete with expensive smartphones, but the price of it, excuse me, is not that, not that. <br><br>  In general, to be honest - I did not expect this from a "fake" and even with such a price.  We are used to expect a lot from expensive devices, and they do not always justify the investment, this device at its cost in many ways showed itself better than, not like many models of leading world brands in the same price segment, but also some more expensive models the same brands.  However, I don‚Äôt intend to keep this device. <br><br>  PS I apologize for the quality of the pictures, there was only a soap box at hand. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95698/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95698/</a></p>
