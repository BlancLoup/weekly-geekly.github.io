  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Current cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With the growth of popularity and the price of Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies have been pulled up: there are more of them, they are becoming more diverse and supported, and many creators have invested a lot of money.  Everyone has their own differences and advantages, their own mining complexity, their own price and services.  And until everything settles down it's just a big lottery in which you can try your luck. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e33/5b0/fb8/e335b0fb8b8e2b3c32621f0b4c290a17.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Why create your own cryptocurrency and invest in its development (website development, public relations, services to work with it, etc.)?</b> <br>  In general, everything is simple: investing with the expectation of wealth in the case of the popularity of their currency, because the one who has the very first access to the currency can remember it on smart conditions (at the very beginning the lowest complexity and the largest exhaust in coins).  And only then it is laid out in the public domain.  However, not all currencies are mined by the creators to off.  launch, and the lack of pre-mine then plays a good role in agitating the public to its own cryptocurrency.

      Of the cryptocurrencies, the most popular at the moment are BTC Bitcoin ($ 1,000), LTC Litecoin ($ 30), NMC Namecoin ($ 7.7), PPC PPcoin ($ 6.1), however, you can still argue about the last two too fast. <br><br>  What is mining and working with cryptocurrency in general? <br>  It's simple: download the wallet from the off site and wait for it to sync. <br>  Almost all wallets look like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fc/64b/97f/9fc64b97f06d07e7cee6ce942956cdd9.png"><br>  Next, download the miner (or the miner is already built into your wallet) and find the pool (a place for general mining of cryptocurrency, because if the complexity is high, it is not profitable for one to mine).  We adjust the miner to work with the pool and run.  Miners are for the CPU (processor) and GPU (video card).  Personally, I don‚Äôt lag anything with a CPU miner, it‚Äôs not even noticeable.  GPU miners maynite several times faster, but significantly slow down the computer. <br><br>  How can you earn?  Well, there are many ways. <br>  1) If you do not want to play with luck, then it makes sense to find a currency that has a simple withdrawal service, mine and immediately withdraw.  For example <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copperlark">copperLark</a> (mine <a href="http://flylark.net/">here</a> , Help -&gt; Start mining). <br>  You can <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php%3Ftopic%3D307648.0">pay</a> for them with a <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php%3Ftopic%3D307648.0">mobile phone and some online games</a> (I tried to pay for the phone, wait 3-4 hours for enrollment, but everything comes).  If you put the CPU miner on the computer in the background, it does not interfere with the core business, you can put 300-600 rubles per month on a mobile phone. <br><br>  Or you can do the same, but put the currency on one of the exchanges.  To achieve the minimum amount of withdrawal, withdraw in rubles real (poison, webmoney, kiwi, etc.).  From exchanges I can advise upbit.org (no problems with withdrawal, commission of 0.1%, supports bitcoins, copkercoins, lightcoins, dollars, rubles and euros) and <a href="https://btc-e.com/">btc-e.com</a> (0.2%, more currencies, also no problems with However, the rates are always lower than on other exchanges.) <br><br>  2) Buy or mine a new currency.  The main thing here is to find something with potential, start mining and forget about 5 years. If you are lucky, it will fire.  However, many people simply buy a new currency of all kinds for ridiculous money in large quantities and wait for one of them to shoot. <br><br>  3) Trade.  (Subject to a commission of 0.1‚Äì0.2% and huge currency jumps (they can be under + 300% in a day) can be profitable). <br><br>  As a conclusion, it can be said that the whole currency is a lottery, and one of them will clearly shoot (no one will refuse the benefits of cryptocurrency (anonymity, decentralization, control of the amount of money in the market, a small percentage of transfer or lack thereof, the inability to fake) even if Bitcoin collapse), so there is still time to try your luck, until it is late and the risks are small. <br><br>  UPD <br>  A short list of cryptocurrencies with their graphs and price: <a href="http://coinmarketcap.com/">coinmarketcap.com</a> <br>  English  cryptocurrency wiki: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrenrencies</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204568/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204568/</a></p>
