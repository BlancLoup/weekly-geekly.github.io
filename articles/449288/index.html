Marketer - the person who exactly answers the question how best to sell your product </h4><br>  Before proceeding to the development of a store, we must understand how the customer‚Äôs goods are sold and how information about it is sold in practice.  How many requests do potential buyers (demand) make per day?  How do buyers search for a product of interest?  And much more.  This is necessary to create a complete picture giving the development team an understanding of how to present the proposal ‚Äúwith benefit‚Äù for the buyer. <br><br>  That is, first of all, it is necessary to conduct a competent Analyst of the situation on the market.  This is part of the job of a person in the role of ‚ÄúMarketer‚Äù.

Market segments and examples will be discussed in more detail in the next article.  In the meantime, we will continue to talk about what a good marketer pays attention when analyzing the market / niche / product to create an online store. <br><br>  After conducting detailed analytics, the marketer creates a concept in which he answers a lot of specific, specific questions, some of which we will take as an example. <br><br>  <b>Questions that the marketer answers when conducting analytics:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  An accurate description of all types of customer avatars - who is the customer? </li></ul><br>  <b>Example:</b> product - cosmetic: lipstick, raspberry color, contains environmentally friendly components, in the high price segment (elite) ... <br><br>  <b>Sample avatar:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Girls and women, from 18 years old, from wealthy families, with an average income of (figure) rub. / Month .; </li><li>  Working on ........ (transfer) positions; </li><li>  In companies with the number of employees from (figure); </li><li>  The place of work which is near (we list territorial signs); </li><li>  The territory of residence of which (we list territorial signs), </li><li>  personal income from (figure) rub./mon .; </li><li>  The principle of obtaining funds for which: work, provision for relatives, provision for a husband (housewife); </li><li>  Additionally, it is possible and desirable: having your own business / profession of a cosmetologist; </li><li>  Features: a clear desire for self-care and an understanding of the importance of organic products in the field of cosmetics; </li><li>  Perhaps a bright positioning of such an opinion in social networks. </li></ul><br>  And this is only part of an example of one of the descriptions, one of the types of potential buyers, for one of the products. <br><br>  <b>What other questions does the marketer answer when analyzing the market?</b> <br><br><ol><li>  How many people per day are interested in the product? </li><li>  How many people buy goods a day? </li><li>  How are competitors going? </li><li>  What factors of "success" of competitors can be identified and analyzed? </li><li>  What advertising channels give greater efficiency to competitors? </li><li>  What non-standard methods of promoting their online stores / products use competitors? </li><li>  What usability concepts do successful competitors use? </li><li>  What concepts work best, for whom, for what reasons? </li><li>  How to submit information about products successful competitors? </li><li>  What advertising investments can successful competitors make? </li><li>  What exactly gives successful competitors more advantages over the others in terms of advertising / design of an online store / presentation of information / techniques to ‚Äúcapture the attention and interest‚Äù of a visitor? </li><li>  What techniques of ‚Äúgrabbing the attention and interest‚Äù of the visitor are most effective at each stage of the user's journey through the site? </li><li>  What are the stages of the user's travel through the site for successful competitors?  Examples of stages: first glance, visiting the section ..., visiting the product page, interest in delivery information, interest in company information, product search, adding to cart, process of registration, payment ...) </li><li>  What type and design style do the most successful competitors use? </li><li>  What design techniques do successful competitors use? </li><li>  What effective user convenience techniques do successful competitors use? </li><li>  What filters and how do successful competitors offer visitors? </li><li>  (Important) What technologies do online competitors make successful competitors? </li></ol><br>  This is only part of the questions.  However, for a professional marketer, the answers to these questions are already enough to create a ‚Äúsuccessful concept‚Äù, a well-functioning online store and a high-quality advertising strategy, the result of which you will measure the level of your income growth compared to costs. <br><br><h4>  Design team </h4><br>  <b>2 Design team</b> - people who will turn the concept created by the marketer into a high-quality packaged visual offer in order to maximize the interest of the site visitor with your product or service. <br><br>  There are various design tools on the software market that are suitable for creating prototypes and site design layouts.  One of the most recognized today, in my opinion: Sketch, Axure, Adobe XD, Figma, Webflow, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Muse, Adobe Illustrator.  Each tool is designed for a specific case, although many duplicate the functionality of each other. <br><br>  A good designer always uses only a few tools, but he knows and can work in the whole range of design tools. <br><br>  <b>What are the stages of the work of the design team at the moment really need to work?</b> <br><br>  There are two roles in the design team that works to bring benefits to the client: Art director - managerial role and Designer - executive role. <br><br><h4>  Art Director </h4><br>  Development of a prototype of a resource - the creation of a ‚Äúresource scheme‚Äù following the concept of a specific marketer.  The prototype is a kind of scheme, better in dynamic (changing) execution, which demonstrates the location and operation of the resource elements, menus, filters, actions, etc.  It is good when basic information is immediately embedded in the prototype (texts, sales offer, example of information about products ...) <br><br>  Creating a design concept is an exact description: what colors to use when designing, in what style to create a design, what instructions / rules to follow. <br><br><h4>  Designer </h4><br>  Development of graphic elements - icons, pictures, backgrounds, infographics, non-standard graphics, effects, etc. <br><br>  Creating a technical assignment for designers and programmers to develop effects and layout. <br><br>  Development of the design layout - Rendering of the resource interface in graphic design according to the prototype created earlier, taking into account the design concept. <br><br>  And so, you and I find out that at least 2 people are needed to create a quality design for an online store. <br><br>  Professionals developing in the field of web design should not only be proficient in design tools but also know all possible styles, be familiar with current trends, be able to conduct ‚Äúlocal‚Äù analytics on the quality of design and reasonably express their opinions, understand well the principles of ‚Äúusability‚Äù and navigate in them.  This is the minimum that makes the work of a web designer professional, and his professional. <br><br><h4>  Layout makers </h4><br>  <b>3 Maker</b> - <b>ups</b> - produce the creativity of designers in a format acceptable for posting on the Internet (html code). <br><br>  Layout designers are a type of developers who, using the tools of the ‚Äúlayout‚Äù language (programming), HTML recreate the creative work of designers so that browsers perceive this information and can provide it to the site visitor. <br><br>  These same people ‚Äúpull‚Äù that is, they integrate the layout (programmed code) into the CMS (online store management system). <br><br>  CMS is needed for easy and simple management of an online store, quick stock creation, easy change of any elements, quick addition of new products, pricing, integration of payment systems, CRM and so on ... <br><br><h4>  Programmers </h4><br>  <b>4 Programmers</b> create the basis of a resource (backend), complex software functionality (filters, scripts, effects) and the visual basis (frontend). <br><br>  Frequently, partly, the work of programmers is carried out by layout designers, but this concerns the so-called simple online stores on open CMS, which are distributed on the market both for free and for a fee. <br><br>  However, the concept of an online store is often associated with the concept of ‚Äúhigh load resource‚Äù or ‚Äúhigh server load‚Äù.  What does it mean? <br><br>  This means that a resource (store) is visited every minute by a large number of users, bots, and other ‚Äúconnections‚Äù. <br><br>  Thus, the concept of ‚ÄúLoad on the resource‚Äù is formed.  In more detail about the load, the reasons for its formation and the methods of its reduction will be described in subsequent materials. <br><br>  An important factor in overcoming the load, among others, is the ‚Äúload resistance‚Äù of the database and CMS.  This is where we need the programmers. <br><br>  People of this profession should be well versed in modern web technologies, principles of web resources, know several programming languages, principles of load generation, the concept of resource burglary, be able to think analytically, understand modern means and methods of protecting websites and encryption, and many of all that is interesting that it is difficult to realize and remember a person who has little interest in this field of IT. <br><br>  Powerful teams that create high-quality online stores usually have a staff of programmers. <br><br>  Let's briefly analyze what roles are part of such a minimal team. <br><br>  <b>Team Leader</b> - development manager.  Strategist, ‚ÄúLieutenant‚Äù - formulates and sets tasks.  checks their execution, uploads the result to the main server, monitors the work of the command. <br><br>  <b>Backend developer</b> - a programmer who creates the server part of the product that the user does not see.  This is the ‚Äúordinary‚Äù result of which work - an online store engine that works without failures. <br><br>  <b>Frontend developer</b> is the second ‚Äúinvisible front fighter‚Äù whose result, the part visible to the user and site visitor, is its interface. <br><br>  <b>5 Copywriters</b> - those who create content, write it from scratch or redo it already created. <br><br>  Copywriters in their work obey the rule of ‚Äúunique content‚Äù.  Creating content from scratch or reworking already created, they try to make it as unlike as possible.  This is necessary both to promote the site and to ‚Äúgive quality to the brand.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>6 Content managers</b> are specialists who fill a web resource with content. <br><br>  These specialists fill the site with goods, information created by copywriters and marketers, apply graphics and images that were previously made by designers. <br><br>  <b>7 Project manager</b> - a manager who, knowing the whole picture of the project ‚Äúas a whole,‚Äù manages the entire development team, all processes and interacts with the client. <br><br>  One of the most important roles.  By the fact that with quality management, deadlines are met and a good product is obtained.  The person in this role is often a professional of Agile and modern methods of project management. <br><br>  Its main task: to make the project on time and of maximum quality. <br><br>  Its result: a finished product in time, a work product in which there are no errors and flaws. <br><br>  <b>Now we understand who needs to create a high-quality and stable online store:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Marketer </li><li>  Art Director </li><li>  Designer </li><li>  Coder </li><li>  Team leader </li><li>  Backend Developer </li><li>  Frontend developer </li><li>  Copywriter </li><li>  Content manager </li><li>  Project Manager </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449288/</a></p>
