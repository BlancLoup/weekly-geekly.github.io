Alcohol accounting markup</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In 2018, in the history of the Unified State Automated Information System a new stage begins - the obligatory blot counting of alcohol products.  Preparations for the transition to the new scheme of work has already started.  Since September 2017, the composition of documents and requisites of the Unified State Automated Information System among wholesalers has been systematically changing.  Now it's time and retailers.  How to automate alcohol retail under the new rules, we consider in detail in this article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ig/6q/uk/ig6qukbozajrnxnrcrziwajdod0.jpeg" alt="Alcohol accounting records in  3.0"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Why there is a need to upgrade EGAIS 2.0 </h2><br>  The first representatives of the wholesale segment - manufacturers and importers who work with large quantities of products - began working at USAIS.  For the account used excise stamps, which were issued in series or ranges of codes. <br><br>  In the old version of the Unified State Automated Information System 2.0 each number of alcohol was issued the number of excise stamps corresponding to the number of bottles produced.  Excises were not tied to a specific bottle, but to a batch released.  The company‚Äôs account indicated the number of bottles issued for a specific lot and the range of excise stamp codes.  That is, each bottle from the lot corresponded to a specific code from the specified excise range, but it was not clear which one. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      And what happened in retail with such a scheme?  The same bottle could be repeatedly resold and be on the balance at once in several retail outlets.  As a result, whoever first scanned such a bottle was lucky, and in another store it could have been found counterfeit, with all the consequences. <br><blockquote>  <i>After a year of such ‚Äúdances with tambourines‚Äù, it became clear that working in such a format does not suit the retail trade representatives at all.</i>  <i>The need to create a new retail coordination mechanism has become apparent.</i> </blockquote><h3>  So, the chronology of the introduction and development of EGAIS in the Russian market is as follows: </h3><br><ul><li>  From January 1, 2016 - retail outlets in urban and rural settlements are obliged to confirm the fact of purchase (acceptance) of alcoholic beverages in the EGAIS system. </li><li>  From July 1, 2016 - the fixation of the sale fact in the EGAIS began without fail. </li><li>  From 10/1/2016 - the alignment of the residues was taken under control. </li><li>  From 01/01/2017 - FS PAP begins to control the remains of alcoholic beverages. </li><li>  01.03.2018 - the transition of the document flow on EGAIS to version 3.0 is planned </li><li>  On July 1, 2018, a full transition to a blot accounting of alcohol in retail is planned. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ot/ro/q1/otroq1umgwfmgatlezbcw5oyoz0.jpeg" alt="In 2018, the start-up of alcohol accounting"><br>  <i>Brown alcohol accounting in retail will be introduced from July 2018</i> <br><br><h3>  What are the deadlines set for the transition to EGAIS 3.0 </h3><br><ul><li>  <u>January 15 - February 1, 2018</u> - the preparatory stage of implementation, during which retail outlets will have to indicate when writing off an individual bar code for each bottle.  The goods remaining in the balance until 15.01.2018 will be taken into account according to the old scheme until full implementation, but with the stipulation about the limitation of the shelf life. </li><li>  <u>February 1 - July 1, 2018</u> - mixed accounting scheme.  The stores will begin to receive products on blot accounting, which should be written off in the same way.  Writing off the rest of the goods is allowed as before. </li><li>  <u>From July 1, 2018</u> - the movement of all alcoholic beverages from the manufacturer to the buyer will be carried out on the basis of the mark accounting.  If this requirement is not observed, sellers may lose their alcohol license. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_k/rn/p7/_krnp7crkpcayhz7hzgztawuwji.jpeg" width="800" alt="In order to fulfill the requirement of the FS PAP on the alcohol booster counting, time is needed, therefore the implementation time has been shifted by half a year."><br>  <i>FS RAR pushed back the timeline for the implementation of EGAIS 3.0, so that entrepreneurs have time to prepare</i> <br><br><h2>  How EGAIS 3.0 will work </h2><br>  In the version of the EGAIS 3.0 protocol, mechanisms are introduced for tracking the legality of alcohol not only in the wholesale supply sector, but also in retail.  Now there will be a bloc counting of each bottle, and this becomes a prerequisite when carrying out operations with alcohol: <br><br><ul><li>  acceptance; </li><li>  inventory; </li><li>  move. </li></ul><br>  In the accounting of an enterprise, appropriate forms of documents are introduced for the registration of all business processes.  Of course, this will complicate the work, since blot accounting requires more time and effort.  Imagine the process of blot acceptance and distribution of trucks alcoholic beverages.  In this case, the deadline for acceptance of the goods in accordance with the Unified State Automated Information System has not been canceled (up to 3 days). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fc/ek/nf/fceknfewcl9ldpz5zi8jdeuehyy.png" alt="Unmarked alcohol accounting in USAIS 3.0 requires scanning and checking the excise mark on each bottle"><br>  <i>In order to fulfill the requirement of the FS PAP for a booster alcohol counting, you must scan each excise stamp on the bottle.</i> <br><br><h2>  What should entrepreneurs do? </h2><br>  In order to fulfill the requirements of the FS PAP on blot counting, retail representatives need to read two-dimensional bar-aggregators with the help of scanning equipment with which suppliers will equip the packaging of their products.  Bar code aggregation implies that a single bar code will be formed for any team of alcohol groups (box, pallet, etc.).  Using this precast barcode, by scanning, you can identify all excise stamps that make up the lot. <blockquote>  <i>But, when the box or pallet is disbanded, it will be necessary to read the code of each bottle, i.e.</i>  <i>take into account the alcoholic products in blots.</i>  <i>And one thing is if it is a small store with a small assortment, where it is possible to work individually with each bottle, even without an aggregated bar code, and another thing is if you have a supermarket with a large flow of goods and throughput.</i> </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pk/rh/6m/pkrh6maxwb1y8k6gejbnvlraq5s.jpeg" alt="The barcode aggregator in USAIS 3.0 will contain information about all excise stamps that are contained in the group"><br>  <i>When breaking up boxes or pallets with alcohol, the retail store must perform a blot check on each bottle before putting it on the shelf in the sales area.</i> <br><br><h2>  How to be, where to start </h2><br>  The first and most obvious is that you need good, efficient scanning equipment.  Accounting accounting requires more effort and time, and if the technique will "stupid" with each scan, it will not be good.  The best solution would be a <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/terminaly-sbora-dannyx/">data collection terminal for USAIS</a> .  It is worth saying that there is no specialized TSD for USAIS; any terminal with a 2D scanner that reads two-dimensional barcodes will do.  You can even use a mobile phone, but we would not advise if you have more than a couple dozen bottles of alcohol a day. <br><br><h3>  Hand-held scanner or TSD for USAIS: if there is no difference, why pay more? </h3><br>  There is a difference and, in terms of functionality, significant. <br>  The usual <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/skanery-shtrix-kodov/skanery-dlya-egais/">2D scanner will</a> scan the excise stamp without problems, but: <br><ul><li>  not able to process a large amount of information due to binding to the workplace and insufficient functionality; </li><li>  does not perform validation checks (during the transitional period, when the use of alcohol on batch accounts is still allowed); </li><li>  does not have feedback from the staff, which leads to many errors due to the fault of the human factor. </li></ul><br>  That is why barcode scanners are only suitable for small volumes.  They can still be used in small retail outlets or in public catering, but in the future it is still better to switch to the TSD in order to optimize work in the USAIS.  The data collection terminal is a multifunctional device, a mobile computer that can be used not only on alcohol acceptance, but also in the sales area for inventory.  And, of course, its main advantage is that various mobile software is installed on it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sg/d0/eg/sgd0egvhgf2dubpe1o39b5cynp0.png" width="600" alt="To work with EGAIS 3.0, it is enough to purchase a TSD with a two-dimensional scanner."><br>  <i>To work with EGAIS 3.0, it is enough to purchase a TSD with a two-dimensional scanner.</i> <br><br><h2>  What software to choose for USAIS 3.0 </h2><br>  We have already written about <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile-egais/">DataMobile</a> software products <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile-egais/">with the EGAIS module</a> .  But time passes, laws change, and our software solutions will be improved in accordance with them. <br>  <b>What is DataMobile?</b>  DataMobile software products are designed to manage processes in the warehouse and in the store using mobile devices (data collection terminals) on Windows CE, Windows Mobile or Android OS.  Compatible with a variety of commodity accounting systems ("1C: UT10.3", "1C: UT11", "1C: Retail", "Dalion", "Traktir", "Shtrikh-M: Trading Enterprise", etc.).  Can be integrated into any other configuration or product accounting system, thanks to the open exchange format. <br><blockquote>  <i>A feature of the software is the parametric setting of any business processes (without additional programming).</i>  <i>Integration into typical configurations of accounting systems occurs in 5 minutes and without a headache.</i>  <i>And the setting using parameter selection allows an entrepreneur to configure almost any business process exactly as it happens or is convenient for his enterprise (simply by ticking the checkboxes in the interface).</i>  <i>At the same time, settings can be saved and automatically transmitted to all mobile devices.</i> </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0n/82/3q/0n823q5rrf0ghyx9g77nwet-jk4.jpeg" alt="No need to complicate! Software DataMobile  integrates into a typical 1C configuration in 5 minutes!"><br>  <i>Parametric settings in DataMobile UGAIS software allow you to automate any business process without the need for additional programming</i> <br><br><h2>  A few words about the versions DataMobile for USAIS </h2><br>  EMAIS DataMobile is <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/programmnoe-obespechenie/po-skanport/DataMobile-EGAIS/">ready-made solutions for automating the accounting of alcoholic beverages</a> in a warehouse, in a shop or catering.  The solution architecture consists of the main universal DataMobile software version Standard PRO, Online Lite or Online (where there is a functional for automating any business accounting process) and the DataMobile  module.  The Unified State Automated Information System module extends the basic version of the program with additional functions required when registering alcoholic beverages in the Unified State Automated Information System: <br><br><ul><li>  The mark acceptance of alcoholic beverages on the basis of the document EGAIS TTN 3.0. </li><li>  Registration of alcohol products and the formation of the document EGAIS 3.0, the act of putting on balance. </li><li>  Acceptance by barcode pallet packaging. </li><li>  Moving products through the warehouse and sales area </li><li>  Shipment of goods and the formation of documents  3.0 . </li><li>  Write-off of alcoholic beverages and the formation of documents EGAIS 3.0. </li><li>  Checking the validity of excise stamps in the system FSRAR for format 2.0 </li><li>  Automatic unloading of accepted marks in <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/programmnoe-obespechenie/po-atol/Frontol%2520Alco%2520Unit/">Frontol AlcoUnit software</a> </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zd/op/qb/zdopqbknad5tvwdsl3rjc8q6jls.png" width="250" alt="Excise Mark Scan"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fm/ec/yn/fmecynpv_ucdnbbyj2ayxpmbnb8.png" width="250" alt="Check of excise stamps"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gp/ac/ue/gpacueo-wg3pclydfmzyhc6zxda.png" width="250" alt="Alcohol list"><br>  <i>DataMobile EGAIS for Android has a convenient and intuitive user interface</i> <br><br><h2>  And now about the main thing. </h2><br>  Above, we wrote about how dreary and long it is to take alcohol products, but during the transition period, which allows to accept products for batch accounting ( 2.0), it is also necessary to check these excise stamps for validity after each scan. <br><br>  In DataMobile  a unique mechanism for checking excise stamps in the background is implemented, regardless of the actions of the operator.  When scanning the excise stamp, you do not need to wait for a response to a request for verification in the PAP FS after each scan.  When accepting alcohol in large quantities, it is possible to scan each excise mark with a task verification from TTN, but without checking in PAP FS (recall, checking each mark on PAP servers can take from 3 seconds to an hour). <br><br>  DataMobile EGAIS data of all brands will go to the accounting system of the commercial enterprise, then in the background there will be a check of the marks on the servers of the FS PAP, as a result of which the merchandiser will decide on the acceptance of this TTN in whole or in part.  All verification information is displayed as a clear, visually understandable report. <br><blockquote>  <i>While the operator performs the scan, information is automatically entered into the system for verification, and the result is visualized according to different statuses, for example, legality, fact of sale, etc. This process occurs regardless of the actions of the employee at the acceptance or the scan volume.</i> </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3o/xj/zw/3oxjzwdtaowjj1pcbvvpy6nafzy.png" alt="Software DataMobile  allows you to check excise stamps for validity in the background"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ca/nz/0y/canz0yr3f086hlz-orhlp9c8tvg.png" alt="In DataMobile EGAIS software, the excise stamp background check mode is clearly visualized by check status"><br><br><h2>  Other advantages of DataMobile software for working with EGAIS 3.0 </h2><br>  The <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile-egais/">DataMobile EGAIS</a> module in the standard package is immediately ready for operation and does not require additional programming.  The basic settings at USAIS allow you to quickly perform several actions and begin to organize the accounting records.  But these are not all the advantages: <br><br><ul><li>  Operations are performed in real time: each excise stamp instantly falls into the system‚Äôs accounting loop and can be immediately checked or checked with documentation. </li><li>  The module supports a wide range of scanning equipment - <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/terminaly-sbora-dannyx/">TSD</a> or other mobile devices on Android or Windows. </li><li>  When working in DataMobile, the Unified State Automated Information System does not need to register a TSD in the PAP FS (this requirement is imposed on some other programs). </li><li>  Provides all the necessary functionality for product distribution for a warehouse or store of any format. </li></ul><br><blockquote>  <i>Software DataMobile  allows a retail outlet to meet the requirements of FS PAP with minimal effort and smoothly switch to work with EGAIS 3.0.</i>  <i>The module is universal from the point of view of business processes; software is easily integrated and scaled.</i> </blockquote><br>  Among other things, DataMobile is constantly updated with enhanced functionality, and for software users, these updates are free.  Also, free technical support is provided in the online <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/">help-desk</a> service mode <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/">on the developer's site</a> .  In the same place in free access you can find detailed instructions and download demo versions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/349820/">https://habr.com/ru/post/349820/</a></p>
