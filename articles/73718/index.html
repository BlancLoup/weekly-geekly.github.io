A support service is one of the ways to use it.  The site has a ready-made support service version with one operator. <br><br>  I myself have long been engaged in the development of Internet projects, including my personal ones.  I have a small portal <a href="http://infan.ru/">infan.ru</a> , for which the task of creating a web messenger initially arose. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Before me often arose the need to create on the site the functions of user correspondence between themselves.  For example, private messages on the forum and chat, chat on a dating site.  Usually a simple option was made for this, like e-mail - scattered incoming and outgoing messages, as on many of today's websites.  Simple, but not very convenient for users - there is no separate correspondence history for each user, it is inconvenient to respond to messages, there is no contact list, you need to constantly update the site and check incoming messages.

      I always wanted to have a communication service on a site like ICQ, but there was no time to develop it.  And now, after a few years, I decided to take the time and make such a service.  Immediately I decided to abstract from my project and make the service completely separate and connected to any site. <br><br>  In the end, everything turned out, and now on my site, users communicate through a new instant messenger.  I suggest all owners of interactive sites also take advantage of this service.  The site has detailed instructions for connecting the messenger and code samples.  You can also ask questions to the support service and the forum.  By connecting the service to your site, you will add a useful and user-friendly feature for free. <br><br>  I note that few sites on the network offer their users a similar communication service, even on such a popular site as classmates only recently made communication in the form of an instant messenger, instead of the ‚Äúincoming-outgoing‚Äù scheme, as it was before. <br><br>  In addition, on sites that have their own messenger, it usually works through periodic updates or ajax requests, i.e.  It is not a full-fledged instant messaging service like ICQ. <br><br>  The messenger described here works in a different way, namely using a constant connection to the server and instant response to incoming messages, i.e.  similar to this IM. <br><br><h4>  Benefits </h4><br>  - Easily integrates to any site. <br>  - Does not require user registration <br>  - Communication both online and offline <br>  - All correspondence history is stored and available in the chat window <br>  - Uses a permanent connection to the server to communicate in real time and reduce traffic <br>  - Ability to customize the service to any domain <br>  - The client part uses only HTML and javascript <br>  - There is a version for mobile wap sites <br><br><h4>  Implementation </h4><br>  The service is developed in PHP using MySQL database. <br>  Works in conjunction with the nginx web server via the fastcgi protocol. <br>  A single-threaded C-language server has been developed for serving persistent connections.  With increasing load it is possible to parallelize the service on several servers. <br><br>  The service is already fully functional, but it still continues to work on testing, improving and correcting errors.  The plans have a desire to implement several new functions, for example, try to connect the messenger with Jabber and ICQ, add skins.  Please, everyone who is interested in such a service, express your comments and suggestions for improvement. <br><br><h4>  Use cases </h4><br>  The service can be used on any interactive sites that have regular users, for example: forums, blogs, chat rooms, dating sites, social networks, online games, etc., as well as it can be connected as a support service or feedback form to any site even on free hosting. <br><br><h4>  Monetization </h4><br>  The project was made, first of all, for its own needs without large investments and costs, and the task of quick profit is not worth it.  In the future, it is possible to place unobtrusive text advertising of their projects in the chat window, as well as to introduce additional paid services and tariffs without advertising.  If possible, we will try to keep the option of free connection, as well as not to change the conditions of already connected sites, especially those who do not create a large load on the server.  Also in the plans there is a desire to open a service for foreign sites, where it will be possible to apply a more monetary policy. <br><br>  PS The user counter on the site shows all users who have logged in at least once in the instant messenger, and not those who are online.  The service has recently opened, and few users are still online. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73718/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73718/</a></p>
