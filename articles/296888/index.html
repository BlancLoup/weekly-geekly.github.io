      A word to the professional. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Current Location:</b> <br>  Moscow, Art.  m. Victory Park <br><br>  <b>Current place of work:</b> <br>  Qlean.ru and Shelly.ru - Marketing Director <br><br>  <b>Education:</b> <br>  Finance Academy under the Government of the Russian Federation <br><br>  <b>One word that best describes how you work:</b> <br>  So far it is often chaos, because of the large abundance of tasks and sources of attraction, but we have already grown from a startup into a fairly large business and now I‚Äôm trying hard to make these words: order and strategy. <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you work?</b> <br>  12-14 <br><br>  <b>Current mobile device:</b> <br>  iPhone 6 <br><br>  <b>Current computer:</b> <br>  MacBook Pro 15 "last generation <br><br>  <b>Without any applications, programs, utilities you can not live?</b> <br>  All types of instant messengers, in the first place are Skype, Slack and Telegram.  I am waiting for someone from colleagues in the shop, startups to be made by an aggregator of instant messengers, although probably none of them would agree to give up their Api and lead the client to the aggregator.  This would solve a lot of problems.  I also use the feed blocker on Facebook (News Feed Eradicator) and Gliphy to build processes.  + we have JIRA, in which we set development tasks. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack helps you save time?</b> <br>  I do not travel by car, so I use 40 minutes in the subway to clean mail, plan tasks for the day and solve 1-2 quickkill. <br><br>  <b>What kind of to-do manager do you use?</b> <br>  I used Workflowy, then a notebook, now I stopped at Trello.  And we use it in the company for setting tasks and keeping track of the designers' time, but I also made a separate board for my own tasks there.  While planning there. <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br>  When you need to concentrate on documents, contracts, etc.  - I listen to Indian and Tibetan mantras.  During the working day usually: Wu-tang, Ice Water, Die Antwoord. <br><br>  <b>What are you reading now?</b> <br>  I just finished Orwell, now I am reading at the same time Salman Rushdie and Peter Thiel's lectures. <br><br>  <b>Which book from the last read was remembered the most?</b> <br>  Ayn Rand - Source.  The book, which strengthened me in the rightness of his life position. <br><br>  <b>Do you use e-readers or prefer paper books?</b> <br>  I read on the phone through Lit.Res, mostly.  With a paper book it becomes very inconvenient, and you need to carry it with you everywhere.  However, I have a library of paper books, which is located in the office, mainly the publishing house MYTH, and each employee can take a read. <br><br>  <b>How long do you sleep?</b> <br>  5-6 hours <br><br>  <b>Are you an owl or a lark?</b> <br>  Lark <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br>  A cup of coffee + a cigarette on the way.  I know that is bad.  But sometime I will correct.  Or not. <br><br>  <b>How do you spend your time on the way to work / from work?</b> <br>  On my way to work, I plan daily tasks.  On the way from work, I read something educational and answer the evening mail. <br><br>  <b>What advice you have ever been given can you convey to others?</b> <br>  ‚ÄúAnd remember - there is no such thing that someone was missing.  You were always the only one, because you didn‚Äôt build a process and relationships. ‚Äù  You need to be more demanding of yourself and not disclaim responsibility on others.  Do not solve local problems, and build processes to solve them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296888/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296888/</a></p>
