However, there was something good about this process.  Let's try to remember what. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/adb/22f/0d4/adb22f0d41fe4d419432a3891633ac3b.jpg"><br><br><h6>  Stage 1: Your name is Jungle: </h6><br>  From the very beginning, we decided to analyze the logos of competitors, and we have quite a few of them.  The result of which was the decision - the logo does not have to be a direct reflection of the essence of the service: speed, cash profit, customer focus, sales growth, all possible ‚Äúup‚Äù badges have become a kind of cliche.  Most of the competitors took precisely these indicators as a basis and we immediately dismissed all possible: handsets, banknote icons, satisfied customers, rockets and mechanisms.

      Our well-known competitor CallBackHunter, the pioneer in the callback market, who is immensely respected by us, chose a leopard for the logo.  A leopard is a predator and a hunter, a CBH is a predatory callback widget, a hunter for clients.  An interesting message.  I immediately remembered: ‚ÄúWWF‚Äù, ‚ÄúPeugeot‚Äù, ‚ÄúWinston‚Äù and ‚ÄúUnited Russia‚Äù and many others: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96a/98b/986/96a98b986ece4d3781a9a235c3d37def.jpg"><br><br>  This gave us the idea to try to find its reflection in the animal world. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  # 2 Stage: One head is good, but five are not very good. </h6><br>  You can follow the path of Christopher Columbus and find something beautiful along the way, but it is better not to hope for good luck and think over the idea beforehand.  We realized that the more sensible the idea and the more thoughtful the logical series, the greater the chance that the logo will be successful. <br><br>  The simple truth is: ‚ÄúThe logo of the company, how it will be perceived by customers, partners and investors, and not a reflection of someone‚Äôs hobby,‚Äù has become our stumbling block.  The idea to stand out with the help of the logo gave rise to deep discussions and tough debates, each member of the team understood to say ‚Äústand out‚Äù something different. <br><br>  When tempers collide, tea, patience and suggested options always end quickly.  After a week of holivars, we understood: brainstorming on the format in which we would like to see a logo is a bad idea ... <br><br>  And suddenly the idea - Elephant!  Why precisely the elephant?  It's simple, elephants are great, everyone loves elephants.  They are big, wise, reliable, associated with stability and strength, loyal to their relatives.  All these concepts matter to us.  In addition, elephants never hurry, but they always reach the necessary point, do not run and do not hunt for anyone, and live longer. <br><br>  To come up with a logo concept and draw it are different things.  We decided not to waste time on disputes, which I must say costing the beginning project is not cheap at all, and turned to the professionals. <br><br>  At Spark we saw a lot of reviews about the ‚Äú <a href="http://logomachine.ru/">Log Machine</a> ‚Äù.  Their approach to work seemed interesting to us and after a couple of hours we began discussing the details. <br><br>  From the correspondence with the "Logomash": <br><br>  <i>Log Machine</i> - Why an elephant, how is it related to the target audience? <br><br>  <i>Cashmyvisit</i> - An elephant doesn‚Äôt need to prove anything in the animal world, it‚Äôs a priori better.  Elephants just do their job and do it well.  There is no communication with the audience, because the logo should not always be turned outwards, it may reflect the ideology of the project team. <br><br>  <i>L</i> - What characters do not use in the sign, in addition to the dollar, banknotes, etc.? <br><br>  <i>S</i> - We are prone to minimalism, do not need any pretentiousness and catchiness.  Do not use the icons of phones and rockets. <br><br>  <i>L</i> - Are there any wishes for fonts and color? <br><br>  <i>C</i> - Without curlicues.  So far we have decided that orange will suit us, the color of creativity, warmth.  And elephants love heat. <br><br>  This simple questionnaire turned out to be quite enough and ‚ÄúLogmachine‚Äù set to work. <br><br><h6>  # 3 Stage: Money is nothing, image is everything. </h6><br>  I think you're wondering: ‚ÄúWhat about the money?‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúLog machine‚Äù cost us little, it's no secret to anyone, the cost of the projects is all on the site.  We were given a long-awaited elephant and a few more ideas to choose from: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e6/d72/718/4e6d7271845f44e0b8c732d153a81c61.jpg"><br><br>  As a result, fruitful cooperation: we got what we wanted - our elephant, and Logomashina received our widget. <br><br>  Promotional ps: <br><br>  Although the logo is an important attribute of any modern company, it is only an external component.  Quality service is much more important, and you will have loyalty from customers and numerous sales. <br><br>  We have both.  <a href="http://cashmyvisit.com/%3Futm_source%3Dspark.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DCashMyVisit">See for yourself</a> ;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291140/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291140/</a></p>
