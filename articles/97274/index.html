      ‚ÄúWe are very pleased that more than 3 million Flash designers and developers now have the opportunity to unleash their creativity in the world of smartphones, netbooks, TVs and other consumer electronics,‚Äù said <i>David Wadhwani</i> , general manager and vice president of <i>Platform Business</i> at <i>Adobe</i> .  ‚ÄúThe combined power of advanced media technology and millions of creative people will surely affect the world in a way that is difficult to imagine.‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Those.  partner support </h5><br>  Device and technology partners, including <i>ARM, Brightcove, Dell, Google, HTC, Intel, Microsoft, Motorola, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, RIM, Samsung, Texas Instruments,</i> and other companies have announced their support for <i>Flash Player 10.1</i> today. <br><br>  <i>AgencyNet, AKQA, Armor Games, Blitz, CNET.com, HBO, JustinTV, Kongregate, Mochi Media, Msnbc Digital Network, Turner, Nickelodeon, Odopod, Photobucket, RAIN, Roundarch, Sony Pictures, South Park Studios, USA Network, Viacom , Warner Brothers,</i> and many others, have also begun to develop in Flash, wanting to achieve a better display on small screens, which include large buttons for user interaction, layout adjustment, and more. <br><br>  More on this at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/flashquote_sheet_101">www.adobe.com/go/flashquote_sheet_101</a> or <a href="http://m.flash.com/">m.flash.com</a> , which contains ad materials from Adobe for optimizing content.  For more information on optimizing Flash content for mobile devices, visit <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/devices/fpmobile/">www.adobe.com/devnet/devices/fpmobile/</a> . <br><br><h5>  New features and high performance </h5><br>  Completely redesigned and optimized for mobile devices, <i>Flash Player 10.1</i> provides new ways to interact with support for mobile input models.  Accelerometer support allows users to view Flash content in landscape and portrait modes.  With smart zoom, users can comfortably scale content in full screen.  Optimization of work for almost all major mobile devices makes efficient use of the processor and battery. <br><br>  The new feature of "smart" rendering ensures that the content in Flash only works when it becomes visible on the screen, which provides even more reduction in the load on the processor and reduces power consumption.  In sleep mode, Flash Player automatically slows down when the device enters splash screen mode.  Advanced memory management (when it is not enough) will allow the player to efficiently process non-optimized content that consumes an excessive amount of resources, as well as automatically reduce the use of RAM by up to 50 percent.  Flash Player automatically pauses when events such as incoming calls or browser transitions to other applications occur.  As soon as users switch back to the browser, Flash Player will show where it left off. <br><br><h5>  Feedback from manufacturers </h5><br>  ‚ÄúAlthough it‚Äôs not the final release, <i>Flash Player 10.1</i> is a significant update that includes a number of new mobile features and features,‚Äù says <i>Al Hilwa</i> , director of application development programs for <i>IDC</i> .  ‚ÄúIt allows users to see a much larger part of websites, and allows developers to use their Flash skills on a much larger number of devices.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúOver the past few weeks, I have already had the opportunity to test the <i>Android Froyo</i> device, where <i>Flash Player 10.1</i> beta is loaded,‚Äù says <i>Ben Bajarin</i> , chief analyst at <i>Creative Strategies</i> .  ‚ÄúOverall, the quality and performance of Flash is impressive.  Mobile users now have access to a full web page with rich Flash content on millions of sites.  With the help of new mobile features, developers also have ample opportunities to develop web content, games, communications and much more, presented on different platforms and <i>Froyo</i> devices and other platforms with full Flash support. ‚Äù <br><br><h5>  Additional resources </h5><br>  To view the demo video of <i>Flash Player 10.1</i> with all devices, including smartphones and netbooks, visit <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/devices/demos">www.adobe.com/devnet/devices/demos</a> . <br><br>  Availability <br>  <i>Flash Player 10.1</i> is expected to be available as a final release as soon as users switch to <i>Android 2.2 "Froyo"</i> .  After this OS update, on smartphones, netbooks and other devices, <i>Flash Player 10.1</i> can be updated in various ways, including downloading updates and through application catalogs such as <i>Android Market</i> , <i>Adobe Labs</i> and others.  The update mechanism may vary depending on the brand of the device and its manufacturer.  <i>Flash Player 10.1</i> for <i>Windows, Mac OS and Linux</i> is available at <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer">http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer</a> today. <br><br><h5>  About Adobe Systems Incorporated </h5><br>  Adobe is evolving with new ideas and information ‚Äî anytime, anywhere, and through any obstacles.
