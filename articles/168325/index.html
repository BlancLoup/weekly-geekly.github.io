In 2007, a few years before the iPad, they already had the N800 Internet Tablet (which, however, by modern standards looks more like a phablet <i>[phablet is something between a tablet and a smartphone, a device with a diagonal of about 5-7 inches, for example, Samsung Galaxy Note - com. per.]</i> ).  Of course, at the moment, Nokia does not produce tablets, however, judging by the comments of Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, who hinted that the company wants to return to this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe market, the situation may change soon. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚ÄúWe have not yet announced the tablets, but we are definitely considering such an opportunity,‚Äù Elop said in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.  ‚ÄúAfter Microsoft introduced the Surface tablet, we carefully study the market and hope from their experience to understand in what way we should take part in all this‚Äù

      What OS will the Nokia tablet work on?  Given the partnership between Nokia and Microsoft in the production of Lumia smartphones, the use of Windows seems inevitable, but Elop did not rule out alternative options, such as Android. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt is important to note that the ability of devices to work together is what each user needs.  If you take, for example, Lumia smartphones running on Windows Phone, then a computer or tablet on Windows or the Xbox is exactly what will give you the opportunity to experience the integrated, combined work of these devices.  Our main priority, what we are looking at first is Microsoft.  However, we have not yet made any decision, and have not made any announcements. ‚Äù <br><br>  Elop used to say that the company is open to alternatives in terms of operating systems.  Last month, he told the Spanish edition of El Pais that the company is considering what role Android and other alternatives can play, but at the moment it‚Äôs still focused on Windows Phone.  However, in an interview with the Australian Financial Review, he said that the growth of Samsung‚Äôs dominance in the Android market has reinforced Nokia‚Äôs rejection of this platform. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAs for Android, we were very worried that we will appear on the market later than the rest of the industry players, as well as the fact that one of the manufacturers was already on the right path to dominating the market for these devices.  If you look back two years ago, then at the time when we made this decision, the big players were Samsung, HTC and Motorola.  During these two years, Samsung has captured the lion‚Äôs share of the market, while other manufacturers, by contrast, have lost some of their share.  And that was the trend that bothered us. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168325/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168325/</a></p>
