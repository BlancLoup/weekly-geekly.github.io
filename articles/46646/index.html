  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fucking traffic</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If I were omnipotent, then each day would begin with a high-speed trip to a cabriolet in the company of a big-breasted companion, so that the wind would wave her hair, and the sun would warm my bald spot.  However, it‚Äôs not so much the lack of a convertible and baldness that hinders the realization of my dreams, as there is an accumulation of cars on the roads.  Today you can forget about the morning trip "with the wind."  However, what is so annoying in real life, can deliver a lot of pleasure in the virtual.  I present your attention to the rating of games where traffic plays an important role: <br><br><h3>  5. Test Drive (1987) </h3><br><img title="Test drive" alt="Test Drive" align="left" width="320" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="5" src="http://s40.radikal.ru/i089/0812/f7/a8900f44f5dc.png">  In 87, the legendary Test Drive series of games began, embodying the cherished dream of boys of any age - to ride a supercar!  We were offered to get acquainted with the bullish temperament of the Lamborghini Countach, the American power of the Chevy Corvette, the James Bond Lotus Esprit Turbo car, the classic Porshe 911 Turbo and the red dream Ferrari Testarossa.  True enough to look at the screenshots to understand that this acquaintance was rather conditional.  But despite the speed of the game 1 frame per second, the developers managed, in my opinion, to successfully convey the feeling of frantic speed.  You are surprised how quickly the backside of the vehicle in front increases and your truck driver's eyes go round.  You barely manage to dodge an imminent collision, and in this game it means the end of the trip. <br>  The game can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.old-games.ru/">Old-Games.ru</a> and remember, and to whom, and find out what the "gonochki" were at the dawn of the computer games era.  It is a pity, but today the first Test Drive looks a bit outdated. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h3>  4. The Need For Speed ‚Äã‚Äã(1994) </h3><br><br><img title="Road rash" alt="Road Rash" align="left" width="320" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="5" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/073/1fc/6fa/0731fc6fa66c71b42537c2637199787f.jpg">  Cooperation with the popular auto magazine Road &amp; Track allowed us to create a game where you could feel the difference in control between the Dodge Viper and some Toyota Supra, as well as other cars, not to mention the roar of engines and a beautiful view from the cabin.  In total it was possible to drive on 9 wheelbarrows.  Unlike Test Drive, NFS was a racing game, the meaning of which is to beat the enemy, and not just go.  Many people remember this game for spectacular accidents involving ordinary drivers, although here they are assigned the role of a third plan.  In the background was the police who wanted to catch the speeding lovers of speed.  Chases with the cops have become one of the main features of the series. <br>  NFS was a stunningly beautiful and exciting game for its time, setting quality standards for the entire genre for the years ahead. <br><br><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/B1DgUpt5fbs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhisLtIsxOFbVS8lHj_tgk3tdqnetg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><br><h3>  3. Road Rash (1994) </h3><br><br><img title="Road rash" alt="Road Rash" align="left" width="320" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="5" src="http://s46.radikal.ru/i112/0812/34/2d091ac89578.jpg">  These were and are the best motorcycle races in the history of games!  You could feel like a reckless biker or biker ready to rush through the city at a breakneck pace, knocking the old women off the road and pushing the biker homies under the wheels as the cars pass by.  Insanely dynamic gameplay combined with fun screensavers and cool soundtrack.  One of the main jokes of the game was the possibility of a chain, bat or fist to go in the face of his rivals in the race or the omnipresent cops.  They could even take the batons away from them and make them stick.  In my opinion, Road Rash had some of the best cross-game images and <a href="http://ru.youtube.com/view_play_list%3Fp%3DBC6C9D7EAB89469B">screensavers</a> , especially when the police were catching you.  According to the game drive, only one game can be compared to Road Rash, read on which one. <br><br><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xlVVdDhAa7A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg2EdRVF6uOyI-OvfzI4Z1irsqLwg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><br><h3>  2. Microsoft Midtown Madness (1999) </h3><br><br><img title="Midtown madness" alt="Midtown Madness" align="left" width="320" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="5" src="http://s60.radikal.ru/i170/0812/70/b422e7477de2.jpg">  In 99, Microsoft opened the era of racing in large three-dimensional cities.  The player had a huge city at that time, the city, there was even its own highway.  The main mode of Midtown madness is racing with rivals, among whom there was even a hefty bus.  But the game did not get into our rating because of it.  Her main chip was simple pokatushek mode.  It was possible to get behind the wheel of the same bus and go to the highway, pushing motorists who fell under the wheels.  And there were really a lot of them, there were even natural plugs.  However, the game had two significant drawbacks.  The first, in 99, the computers did not pull the whole three-dimensional city with active movement, so only the player‚Äôs car looked like a car, and everyone else looked more like boxes on wheels with a pair of brake lights.  Second, MS was frightened by age restrictions and forbade the player to shoot down pedestrians, they just jumped out from under the wheels, and this is a damn significant negative! <br><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/I8Qg2UFv2Q0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhXL4Nnwji_Ue0BvzBPsN47IpeQzg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  1. Grand Theft Auto (1997) </h3><br><br><img title="GTA" alt="GTA" align="left" width="225" height="206" hspace="5" vspace="5" src="http://i068.radikal.ru/0812/a8/b0dd160d065c.jpg">  It's hard to believe, but more than 10 years have passed since the first game of the series came out.  Then and now the game won over by freedom of action.  It was possible to pass missions, and it was possible just to drive, repairing unbelievable chaos to the music of your favorite radio station.  The creators of the game were not afraid of age restrictions, and allowed to realize all the most cherished dreams on the roads, visiting drivers in a multi-hour traffic jam.  Oh, what a bunch of wheelbarrows could be collected, and then blow it up nafig!  Or ‚Äúborrow‚Äù from a military tank and forget about the problem of traffic jams. <br><br>  Everything, I do not want to write more, I will go on to play GTA 4. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/K5M5IGmeWeE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhj7pf5oc3a_gAWByxq75bgq1AwPdQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46646/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46646/</a></p>
