  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Roskomnadzor and advanced technology backlog</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> In the book ‚ÄúGuns, Microbes and Steel,‚Äù the author Jared Diamond discusses in some detail the key technologies that allowed some nations to seriously surpass others in the competitive civilization race, which in the event of clashes led to the complete extinction of the stragglers.  For example, at some point this technology was the discovery of steel and the organization of the production of steel products.  This is a wide layer of various actions, multiplied by the understanding, possibilities, abilities and, most importantly, the maturity of the environment for a new technology. <br><br>  It sounds trivial, but the civilization race has not stopped.  Right now, some nations produce some kind of technology, which, as it will become clear in a hundred or so years, will be key in their civilizational separation from other nations, which are destined to collapse and disappear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a9/9f2/223/5a99f222324d4a25960b13e132b5df14.jpg" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a>  I would call the current key technology this way - the <b>capacity for organized interaction</b> , or the <b>organization of external processes</b> (cultural, social, political).  Those nations, and in some cases, layers of communities that succeed, quickly take the lead.  The rest gradually degrade and disintegrate. <br><br>  The ability to organize interaction results in more specific technologies that require maturity of the environment.  For example: <br>  <b>1. The robotization of all that is robotized.</b>  For example, robotization and the transition to transport without drivers, including the drone, will raise to a revolutionary level the delivery of everything and everyone everywhere.  But this is an analogue of Google offline.  Introduced the request - got the result straight to the door with minimal transaction costs. <br>  <b>2. Venture business</b> , as an opportunity for ideas and enthusiasm to soar to the sky quickly and quickly overgrown with ‚Äúmeat‚Äù of offices, warehouses, technical and legal support, risk insurance, and so on. <br>  <b>3. Growing human capital.</b>  Meaningful pumping "skills" from the very diapers.  Cultivating "stars" is not only for sport and show business, but for all spheres of human activity.  Primarily for social.  For example, in some places in Scandinavia, it is practiced to identify features of a childish nature that potentially increase the propensity for various crimes in more mature age.  Specially trained people who know how to ‚Äúreflash‚Äù and channel their inclinations at an early stage without letting them flourish work with such children. <br>  <b>4. Unconditional Basic Income (AML).</b>  The opportunity for each recipient to start not from scratch, through the poverty threshold to moderate opportunities of the middle class, but immediately from the level of the middle class.  The ability to immediately search for and think about the main sense of what you do, and not about your daily bread. <br>  <b>5. Blockchain technologies</b> , including cryptocurrency.  Smart contracts.  Blockchainization of all that is possible.  Leaving a cumbersome banking system and the institution of paper contracts. <br>  <b>6. Language expansion</b> .  English is becoming increasingly dominant.  The trend is directed towards the development of English as the main language of planetary meaning, which is fixed through films, music, memes, curricula, and so on.  The analogy with the dollar suggests itself.  He is everywhere, his lot and the hosts are in a big win. <br><br>  An interesting example of the collision of organized interaction and "manual chaos" is the prohibitive activity of Roskomnadzor.  The Internet is a great example of technology, where nothing sustainable or meaningful comes from noodle, from some random decision of a random person.  Everything new comes from the old, is built one after another, countless times it is checked for viability and takes the form that is optimal for the current conditions.  So we matured from FIDO to Facebook, from the storage of DOS-files on BBS-ka to cloud services like Amazon S3, which, in turn, are tied to services NetFlix, Airbnb, Twitter, Dropbox and thousands of others. <br><br>  At the same time, another group of people as a result of ‚Äúmanual chaos‚Äù of legislative activity came to such a result that thousands of unknown tenth-level officials were able to block services such as Amazon S3 on the territory of a huge country.  Yes, yes, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/303850/">that's exactly what happened</a> yesterday. <br><br>  The catastrophe of civilization scale lies in the fact that the blockers themselves do not understand at all what exactly is happening, and society has no levers to stop this outrage.  We must honestly admit to ourselves that we have matured to such a state of affairs.  The decision to blacklist any site / service can be made by ‚Äúanonymous experts‚Äù of Roskomnadzor, as well as by any regional courts, the Moscow City Court, the General Prosecutor‚Äôs Office, as well as unknown officials of the Federal Drug Control Service, Rospotrebnadzor and the Federal Tax Service.  These are exactly thousands of people who solve some of their small tasks by pressing a red button in a gray case.  An indefinite mass of undefined people have been given such authority.  This is our current level of capacity for organized interaction. <br><br>  Approximately in this scenario, one of the young officials of the Federal Tax Service was supposed to ‚Äúby Monday‚Äù compile a list of 10 ‚Äúblocked‚Äù sites.  Made up.  We made a standard decision 2-6-27 / 2016-04-06-25-AI and the deed is done.  Meanwhile, the list included one site that used Amazon S3.  And no one's eye twitched from the fact that blocking any one of the left site means blocking the best and largest of the world's services.  But because so organized. <br><br>  Here it is necessary to cough and clarify the figures of speech.  In fact, not ‚Äúthey were blocked‚Äù or ‚Äúwe blocked them,‚Äù but ‚Äúwe self-blocked from them.‚Äù  Because ... uh ... in short, we slapped a mosquito with a falling elephant, by putting it to sleep.  And no need to tell that a mosquito in such a way, in principle, is unlikely to swat.  We just fulfilled the law.  According to the law, this is exactly what the mosquito needs to clap. <br><br>  My own, relatively large site, some time ago was subjected to ‚Äúcensorship trolling‚Äù (by analogy with patent trolling), as a result of which Roskomnadzor was put on the ‚Äúblack list‚Äù several dozen times.  A public log of all locks is <a href="http://ariom.ru/fo/t764.html">kept</a> , where <a href="http://ariom.ru/fo/t764.html">all the moves are recorded</a> <br><br>  It came to enchanting absurdity when anonymous Roskomnadzor experts recognized Occam's Razor as a tool of suicide (three times, Karl, three times!), Forbade neologisms ‚Äúdrink a yadu‚Äù and ‚Äúkiller up the wall‚Äù, or a steady expression ‚Äúbetter to shoot yourself right away‚Äù.  Formally, these phrases are now permanently banned on the territory of the Russian Federation (see the registry entry 101194RI and 99461RI).  The ban can be lifted through the court, but who in their right mind will go to court with a government agency for legalizing the phrase ‚Äúdrink a yadu‚Äù? <br><br>  On January 29, 2016, a <a href="http://ariom.ru/fo/p718250.html">screenshot from Pravda newspaper</a> was declared banned in the Russian Federation. <br>  <a href="http://www.pravda.ru/news/world/europe/easteurope/14-08-2014/1221344-litva-0/">The original source for</a> Roskomnadzor is known and still alive, as well as 700 references to this text on other sites.  This is a textbook case, which can be recalled whenever the RKN will add another stupidity to the "black list". <br><br>  At different times, Habrahabr, Wikipedia, Youtube, Github, CloudFlare, Lurk, and Roscomsvoboda fell under blocking.  Forever blocked the largest torrent sites, as well as information resources related to the subject of bitcoin.  All the troubles are no longer listed, but the process is gaining speed and scale. <br><br>  Recently, dialogues of approximately the following form have been constantly encountered: <br>  - Something your link does not open <br>  - Oh, well, this is an ILV blocking.  Put the plugin to bypass. <br>  - Oh, ok, put. <br><br>  No one perceives a ban as a meaningful ban.  All I perceive it as a minor, annoying failure.  In essence, the prohibitive activity of the RKN turns into nothing more than the artificially introduced meaningless littering of communicative environments, the wasteful burning of the substance of human life, the voluntary underestimation of competitive civilizational abilities.  The analogy is this: someone there decided that now, entering through any door ‚Äúin this country‚Äù, everyone is obliged to sit down on the courts and say aloud ‚Äújust abyrvalg.‚Äù  Otherwise the door MAY NOT open.  Unfortunately, now there is no protection against the introduction of such innovations.  80% do not care, 10% consider ‚Äúit is wise‚Äù, 9% say ‚Äúseriously?  to the courts?  gee! ‚Äù1% understands everything, but cannot do anything.  And now some doors really do not open without squats, some still open.  Some people got tired of squatting (‚Äúso what?‚Äù) And they installed a plug-in that allows you to go to the courts all the time without getting up.  With the plugin almost all the doors open as before.  NEARLY.  Because the plugin needs to be updated, paid, configured.  In addition, the owners of all the doors already oblige to check whether the person crouches on their own, or meanly plug-in ... <br><br>  All these are examples of a rather poor ability to organize interaction while simultaneously blocking access to well-organized interaction.  Admittedly, we forge steel badly.  And not at the stage of impact with a hammer, but at the stage of admission to the hammer of a drunken, low-barrier blacksmith.  Silently using blocking bypass means we voluntarily participate in the civilization gap.  Nothing will change until each round of each block turns into a public scandal that has resonance and consequences. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372407/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372407/</a></p>
