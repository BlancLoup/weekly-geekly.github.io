  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tariff_ under_string</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have "Beeline".  Connected in May of this year, the tariff "Family 2009".  An excellent rate - per second from 1 second, there is no connection fee, 60 kopecks per minute for Beeline and 2.25 rubles.  per minute on everything else in the home region.  Used and grief did not know.  And my family too.  And recently, my mother discovered that money began to withdraw more.  I climbed the site.  Here it is, a <a href="">wonderful fare</a> .  Nothing has changed.  There is no question about any connection fee or per minute billing. <br><br>  I call in support. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Do you know what happened?  This is the tariff for those who connect after June 30.  And who is up to - those tariffs have changed and now the first minute of the conversation is 1.25.  Yes, and billing per minute.  I say - and now what should I do to return the per-second billing?  Well, like that, the answer is very predictable - to connect the new tariff.  90 rubles for the connection.  We, the operator says cheerfully to me, have no violations.  We notify about changes in 10 days in the news section of the site.  And if you do not have access to the Internet, you can always call us and clarify the tariff. <br><br>  With difficulty restraining myself from saying everything I think about it, I hung up and went to the archive tariffs section on the website.  And indeed, in the archive tariffs I see: <br><ul><li>  <a href="">Family</a> </li><li>  <a href="">Family (for connected since 06.26.2008)</a> </li><li>  <a href="">Family 2009 (for those connected before 30.06.2009)</a> </li></ul><br>  There are so many of them, families.  The last one is the one I have now.

      You see how everything is done smoothly.  There was the tariff "Family 2009", it was changed and sent to the archive, instead they made a new tariff "Family_2009".  That is, the user comes to the site.  He chooses his own in the list of tariffs (as it seems to him that this is his own).  Who remembers there was an underline or a hyphen in the title or some other trifle?  Follows the link and sees that the tariff has not changed, ugh, everything is in order.  Continues to use this tariff and overpays.  And in fact, his tariff is not at all this, but one that without underlining in the list of archived tariffs.  And this is a completely different tariff.  You never know what looks like.  The law says nothing about it.  The news of the change in the old tariff, of course, lawfully hang up 10 days before the change.  After some time, the news will be removed and replaced with other news.  That is, you will come to the site some time after the change - the news is already gone.  And in the description of the fare, everything is beautiful.  Only this is not your fare. <br><br>  And in a month or two, you see, this new tariff will be changed.  Put a hyphen instead of underscore.  Or an inseparable space - that's it, a cool idea, I give you, "Beeline"!  As you notice the change, pay 90 rubles and switch to the new tariff.  And you will not notice, so "Beeline" is only better.  And they change tariffs, of course, not regularly.  And "depending on the competitive situation on the market." <br><br>  One thing amazes me - we have a law on free incoming calls, and there is no law on the normal notification of tariff changes.  The client, if he wants to be aware, must either go to the operator‚Äôs site every day and check, or (more interestingly) regularly call for support and clarify.  Well, or take the detail every month and study it.  Only here the detailing is paid. <br><br>  I really hope that at least the law on the possibility of saving the number when changing the operator will be accepted.  Now, only the unwillingness to change the number and the uncertainty that it will be better there stops the transition to the services of another operator ... <br><br>  <b>Upd:</b> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/telecom/75870/">Experience of free tariff change in Beeline</a> - continuation of the story with a happy ending. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75147/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75147/</a></p>
