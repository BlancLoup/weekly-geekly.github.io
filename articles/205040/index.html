  <section class="page js-page"><h1>AgileKitchen Conference Report November 29, 2013</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On November 29, another AgileKitchen conference dedicated to flexible development methodologies took place.  The conference was noted by a considerable number of participants and, as always, by interesting reports. <br>  This time the conference was held in the office of Mail.ru group.  We express our gratitude for the opportunity to use a comfortable and beautiful office. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a1/119/2fa/5a11192fa42777f7822b64c2ebf86d65.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/398/6d5/fb6/3986d5fb6e300be803b5de9e2b43e4f7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Dmitry Lobasev's report on modern trends in Agile in Russia </h5><br>  The first was the introductory report covering the main trends of Agile in Russia and in the world.  Dmitry considered almost all modern (and not so) methodologies, principles and frameworks.  He placed each of them in the diagram of the zhznenny cycle of technology adaptation.

How did they fight against sudden bugs, the closure of which is fixed in the SLA?  How to close the technical debt?  How, with all this, did they manage to make new features and work on Scrum?  You can get answers to these questions from his <a href="http://penxy.com/fypy">presentation</a> . <br><br><h5>  Anton Bevziuk and Dmitry Pavlov on the righteous struggle with technical duty </h5><br>  The third report was the story of Anton and Dmitry about their difficult struggle with technical debt.  To begin with, technical debt was considered as a phenomenon.  What is it and where does it come from?  Is there a ‚Äúgood technical debt‚Äù?  Is it possible to live with technical debt?  Speakers, referring to Henrik Kniberg, affirmed that it is possible to live, only carefully. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f9/2f8/40e/7f92f840e3ddb4fc6515b5e02ba873a3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Anton and Dmitry reviewed and analyzed several different approaches to the closure of technical debt, supported by personal experience, and then formulated an approach that brought the desired result. <br><br>  To view their report please <a href="http://penxy.com/kyle">click here</a> . <br><br><h5>  Climatology of distributed teams as presented by Alexei Koretsky </h5><br>  The conference program was continued by the report of Alexei Koretsky.  In it, Alexey considered the issues of climate measurement in a distributed team.  First of all, questions were formulated about the relevance of the consideration of this topic, after which Alexey introduced the participants of the conference to the three-factor model of A. V. Petrovsky and spoke in detail about the applied methods for studying the team‚Äôs microclimate using sociometry and referentometry, as well as the method for determining Value-Orientation Unity (measures of team cohesion). <br><br>  More information about the report of Alexei can be <a href="http://penxy.com/jasa">here</a> . <br><br><h5>  Survival Agile-team in an aggressive environment according to Sergey Sorokin </h5><br>  In his report, Sergey Sorokin told about how his team developed, how it became flexible, despite all the obstacles and circumstances.  You can familiarize yourself with Sergey's report and understand how his team could remain flexible, becoming distributed, in this <a href="http://penxy.com/miba">presentation</a> . <br><br><h5>  Open space </h5><br>  Afternoon continuation of the conference was Open Space.  Dmitry introduced the participants to the rules of the meeting, after which he invited everyone to write on a piece of paper a question that the participant would like to discuss, or a topic about which he wants to tell.  After the time allotted for the collection of topics, everyone was able to voice their own topic or question and put a sheet on the board. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/634/4eb/f80/6344ebf80d504b5d6b666fe731a9dfdb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After the presentation of ideas, 6 flipcharts (from A to F) were placed in the hall, and the participants of the conference, choosing an interesting topic for them, rushed to them in order to listen, argue, ask and share their knowledge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ce/920/e37/4ce920e37c49b382747f7d28366db1e9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Alexey Pimenov and his view on managerial nirvana </h5><br>  In his report, Alexey, as always in a unique style, reviewed the history of management development in the field of software development and presented his view on the development of this area in the direction of ‚ÄúManagement Nirvana‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18a/2f5/6ca/18a2f56caa60ccc9f71cf9a2089948e4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The presentation is <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/pimenaus/ss-28760327">here</a> . <br><br><h5>  Report by Ahmed Sidky on the Secret Ingredient for Sustainable Flexibility </h5><br><br>  The conference was concluded by one of the founders of the ICAgile international consortium, Ahmed Sidqi, with his report: The Secret (yet obvious) Ingredient to Sustainable Agility. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/320/61e/f1b/32061ef1b6195c5e61706ec98ab51f55.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  First and foremost, Ahmed concentrated on what it means to be flexible (being Agile).  Having reviewed and illustrated the simple example of the Aikido training stage: Shu-Ha-Ri, Ahmed proceeded to consider the difference between stationary and developing ways of thinking (Fixed Mindset vs Growth Mindset). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/296/472/821/29647282190fe93fef6cfe786d5165d0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The conclusion from this part of the report can be considered the following: When you are Doing Agile.  When it is a Mindset and Culture, then you are Being Agile. <br><br>  Further, Ahmed examined the concept of the company's ecosystem and how the point-to-point implementation of flexible approaches can harm organizations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f50/0ad/f4c/f500adf4c26a55aa33aa73b9ff06f6f2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In conclusion, Ahmed spoke in more detail about the ICAgile consortium. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e99/954/345/e99954345829ea35ac0fd7662fb34e0c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, all conference participants who expressed such a desire received an ICAgile.com profile with achieved learning objectives, as a first step towards ICAgile Certified Professional certification. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205040/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205040/</a></p>
