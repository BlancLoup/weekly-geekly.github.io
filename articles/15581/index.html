Even Apple looks to the future of computers after the operating systems lose their relevance.  Apple has already made its way into the living room people, as well as in the field of entertainment.  They have gained a huge advantage in these areas.  They have an operating system, hardware, software, and online services that work together.  Companies like Hewlett-Packard can make a computer.  They have a lot of great ideas, but it all comes down to software, and here they are limited to the operating system that Microsoft sells. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Does the word ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù have the same meaning as 10 years ago?</strong> <br>  Once upon a time, when we first opened Apple, the focus of everything was usually one person.  One person without help could solve technical problems, as well as develop something.  There were many lone craftsmen.  And their work has led to increased innovation.  But now everything is very difficult in the field of electronics and technology.  In addition, people have different work experience.  In this sense, innovation has changed.  In my opinion, innovations are not strangers to many areas of activity even now.  The development of the Internet has led to a huge number of innovative solutions and the opening of completely new Web sites.  For 10 years no one could have imagined that the Internet would play such a big role in this. <br><br>  <strong>And what about iron?</strong> <br>  As for innovations in the field of hardware ... today the market is so large, and there is so much money in it that very few people can afford to work on it, and those who are willing to take risks and produce something radically new are hard to find.  Apple is an exception. <br><br>  Now it all comes down to reducing the size.  For example, you can buy a media card with an integrated camera.  People do not understand that the 4GB card actually consists of 4 chips that are connected together.  Or, for example, iPhone: how to stuff a device as thick as a credit card with such functionality?

      Would you like to change something in the iPhone? <br>  I think the iPhone would look more like a computer.  It should be open like a computer.  Everyone should be able to develop their own games and programs for it.  And the functions of the phone must stand alone, and they must be protected. <br><br>  <strong>Those.</strong>  <strong>Are you a supporter of hacking and using third-party applications?</strong> <br>  From a business point of view, Apple has every right to what they have done.  They have the right to lock.  But I stand on the side of the "burglars", the insurgents who are trying to make it open.  I would really like the iPhone to be open to third-party applications.  I would like to install good games there.  Why can not I fill in the phone call, which I composed myself?  How does it hurt AT &amp; T?  Here Steve Jobs sends letters to record companies asking them to sell unprotected music, but he does something completely different in the case of the iPhone.  I have no idea to what extent AT &amp; T influences its decisions and the choice of the direction in which to move. <br><br>  <strong>Is it enough for you to have one phone?</strong> <br>  I like to be an expert in technical issues and give people advice on various devices, so I try to follow the fashion.  I like the different functions in different phones.  I like the style of some devices, such as Bang &amp; Olufsen.  iPhone need to have, only because.  that everyone knows what it is.  I really like my little BlackBerry Pearl, it is very lih for its size.  This is a very good smartphone, but it is not suitable for work with the Internet.  I like the RAZR, because the sound quality is better than the iPhone.  He's a little louder. <br><br>  <strong>In addition to the appearance of the touch function, how can interfaces change?</strong> <br>  I do not think that something revolutionary can be seen on the horizon, although of course it is certainly difficult to say.  I did not think that the iPhone would be so pleasant.  I was very surprised.  I would like a small computer with a camera to recognize me, and I could control it with gestures, and he would answer me.  Creating a computer that will understand voice and rhythm is very difficult. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://apple.qoody.ru/">Apple Blog</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15581/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15581/</a></p>
