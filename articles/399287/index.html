During this time, many buyers managed to appreciate the advantages of this device.  Polar M600 can be considered an experimental product, as the company added some features for these sports watches, which are not typical for its gadgets. <br><br>  This, for example, the platform Android Wear, the ability to control music playback using Bluetooth and a number of other features.  In general, the experiment can be considered successful, because the watch almost immediately fell in love with supporters of an active lifestyle. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Unpacking </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ca/2bd/e11/5ca2bde11b854574a7bfe85de3288c4d.jpg">

      <br>
      Already by the inscriptions on the box, we see that the gadget works on the basis of Android Wear. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/261/752/582/261752582a2345e588f3c06738614196.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db1/426/055/db1426055b7d4032ab36302948c262f4.jpg"><br><br>  Inside - a sports watch, a small instruction and charging cable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06b/81e/e95/06b81ee950e84dd39bc6bb6d15946255.jpg"><br><br>  The instruction is really small, but it describes most of the functions of the watch and the principle of their work.  Putting the device on hand, you can immediately start using it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/15b/918/930/15b9189307274e5aa9099ef6e3f0e1a6.jpg"><br><br>  At one end of the cable, we see a clip, on the other hand, a normal USB connector.  With this solution, you can connect the watch to any port on your PC or laptop, or use a USB adapter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84e/7fc/5cb/84e7fc5cb6504eb48ed01f65ff50ca37.jpg"><br><br>  Taking the main module in hand, the user immediately notices the optical heart rate monitor.  The company claims to have done everything to achieve high measurement accuracy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d13/524/e82/d13524e82dc842d6afa4e21ecc24c38c.jpg"><br><br>  Separately, it is worth highlighting the presence of black and white straps for sports watches Polar M600 (now online you can buy straps and other colors).  The main module is easily inserted into the strap frame, from where it can be removed at any time.  By itself, the module is held tightly and does not fall out during operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/519/9de/99e/5199de99e93340ec9c754dcf1b9e8b07.jpg"><br><br>  In order to estimate the size of the device, you should look at the picture below, where the M600 is shown next to its ‚Äúrelatives‚Äù: M200 (you can buy watches in our store) and V800 (the price of this device will please many buyers). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32c/7eb/200/32c7eb200d3e49beab62f29e76673f54.jpg"><br><br>  But the Polar M600 compared to the Apple Watch Series 2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b0/951/d45/6b0951d45aa346e5b9fe2d2b0f53b239.jpg" width="720"><br><br>  The battery life of the Polar M600 is about two days.  This is not so little, given the number of functions of this device.  48 hours the device will work when connected to a smartphone with Android, and a day - when any compatible model is connected to the iPhone. <br><br>  The mass of the Polar M600 is just 63 grams.  It's a bit, and the watch while wearing is not felt on the hand, despite its size.  For comparison, you can estimate the mass of other watches: Apple Watch Series 2 - 51 grams, Polar M200 - 40 grams, Polar V800 - 82 grams, Garmin FR35 - 37 grams, Garmin FR25 - 39 grams. <br><br>  The speed of the Polar M600 is impressive.  In fact, this is one of the fastest Android Wear devices on the market. <br><br><h3>  Basic features </h3><br>  When working with the Polar M600, it is worth remembering that this is a watch on Android Wear, which means that the basic functions of the device are almost similar to the basic capabilities of other watches on this platform.  This is a player, timer, Google Fit platform, a number of other applications.  The company has developed its own skin of the dial, which shows the number of steps taken by the user per day and the percentage of completion of the goal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f6/f66/977/6f6f6697796b49fc903b6a964b02b8b0.jpg"><br><br>  The button on the left launches the Android Wear launcher. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c85/33c/620/c8533c6206fb4507b5a5e56b43fe6557.jpg"><br><br>  Google Fit is a platform from Google where all data about user activity is collected.  Information can be viewed already in processed form using graphs and charts. <br><br>  What happens if you press the button located on the front panel of the watch below?  It's simple: this button will give you access to all the features provided by Polar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/624/f43/4f2/624f434f2c8c4e2e8c8271b8cbbac3b9.jpg"><br><br>  The main thing is the sections Training and My Day.  As for My Day, here the user can see all the data on his activity for the day.  This information includes data for each of the workouts, as well as the number of steps per day.  This section also shows the planned workouts.  True, the synchronization in this case is already not going with Google Fit, but with Polar Flow‚Äôs own fitness platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/46a/ef6/4ea/46aef64ea29f4c73aef212b41e5a4928.jpg"><br><br>  The Training section helps you choose the type of training you currently need. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a9/93a/d0c/9a993ad0c153479aa30906d97d7058e5.jpg"><br><br>  So that the user does not forget about the planned training, the clock will show a reminder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec3/f81/964/ec3f819647c946c393b04dce0b026640.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Sport and fitness </h3><br>  Polar M600, first of all - sports watches.  And this means the presence of a large number of modes for training different types.  If desired, the configuration of each mode can be changed independently. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d01/bef/bd9/d01befbd96c24a5b8895ded24a51dcda.png"><br><br>  Clicking on Edit displays the training mode editing window with the ability to change many parameters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/877/bca/4f0/877bca4f059240da9566c56d2e3cda76.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d28/815/aec/d28815aec8e64e33bb05336baeeaf3cf.png"><br><br>  There are quite a few parameters - for each mode, up to 8 pages are allocated here, with 1-4 data entry fields on each page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35c/982/3cf/35c9823cf23b4f5f9903de84d49b3c63.png"><br><br>  In Polar Flow, you can also schedule workouts by listing them on your calendar.  Below in the screenshot, the planned classes are shown in gray.  Red color highlighted completed workout. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d50/aee/7a6/d50aee7a6d664d8bb12d5dc46ecca87c.png"><br><br>  After making changes (on a PC or phone) you need to synchronize them with the clock.  Otherwise, the data in the clock memory will not be saved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a9/93a/d0c/9a993ad0c153479aa30906d97d7058e5.jpg"><br><br>  Thanks to the GPS module, workouts can be conducted without using the phone - the module finds satellites quickly and without problems.  Subsequently, it will be possible to view the trajectory of movement during the workout with the display of coordinates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0db/d25/a00/0dbd25a004364f7aad80852a35858418.jpg"><br><br>  There is one important point - you should not start training until both icons are surrounded by a green circle.  This means that all the preparatory procedures for hours spent, and you can start.  Usually, ‚Äúwarming up‚Äù the device takes only a few seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/528/628/695/52862869570a44a69324478ba018a7c0.jpg"><br><br>  GPS readings are accurate, there are no problems with the module. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/588/bca/838/588bca838b10419e9287f36646b0a9fc.png"><br><br>  The trajectory of movement along the river and on the bridge is accurate, there are no deviations and inaccuracies.  The testimony of the module can be trusted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/345/d8c/885/345d8c885628428997e6e9c6b372c44a.png"><br><br>  All training data with an accuracy of one meter can be viewed afterwards, after the completion of the training cycle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/92b/898/9e0/92b8989e0c9b4e48a45ab5a3e341b26e.png"><br><br>  If the user has completed a session or if you need to take a break, you must swipe to the left in order to pause the clock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/921/2d4/6c6/9212d46c64c04e8fadceb7da5db695bb.png"><br><br>  After that, you can view the details of the training or one of its stages in a relaxed atmosphere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a26/5df/63e/a265df63ec5d4c5ab0095e67d50bfcc7.jpg"><br><br>  In order to synchronize data with the phone or the Polar Flow service itself, you need to make sure that the Polar Flow app is open.  In the case of connecting to the iPhone, you must also make sure that the Android Wear application is running and running (for Android smartphones this is not required).  After synchronization, a window opens with a workout visualization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/158/3b0/26d/1583b026df684e23b11a0e207c921bd4.png"><br><br><h3>  Music </h3><br>  For music lovers, the company's engineers added the ability to save music files directly to the device‚Äôs memory.  The M600 has 4 GB of internal memory, although only 2.6 GB is available for music.  With an average song size of 3.5 MB, 760 music files can be recorded in the watch‚Äôs memory.  More than enough. <br><br>  Since the M600 is equipped with a Bluetooth module, you can listen to music using wireless headphones, which is very convenient during class. <br><br><h3>  Compatible with iOS and Android OS </h3><br>  Since the watch platform is Android Wear, they work perfectly only with Android devices.  Using a smartphone with this OS, the user can easily install third-party applications on their sports watches.  But with iOS, this technique will not work - third-party applications using the iPhone will not work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c8/55c/569/4c855c569cea4c1ab00a6999fa9655ba.jpg"><br><br>  Here are some more features that do not work (yet) when working with iOS (perhaps this can be fixed after the update is released): <br>  ‚óè No player control / music transfer capability; <br>  ‚óè Do not install and use third-party applications; <br>  ‚óè Limited number of supported Google Now commands. <br><br><h3>  Optical heart rate monitor and its accuracy </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e23/a21/9f2/e23a219f2e4240738df52df45262f684.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, the module does not work in 24/7 mode, it is worth taking note immediately.  Pulse can be measured using the Google Fit application, but the data will not be saved to Polar Flow. <br><br>  In normal mode, the Polar M600 is quite accurate.  Similarly, the situation is when measuring during exercise.  The accuracy of the measurements depends very much on the position of the watch on the wrist.  It is worth remembering that the device should be placed at a height of 1-3 centimeters above the wrist.  In this case, the readings of the gadget will be correct.  Otherwise, accuracy will suffer, and severely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4b/c3c/2d3/d4bc3c2d3dff4f95901f4ceb091db8ae.jpg"><br><br>  Users who have tried the Polar M600 sports watch while riding a bicycle claim that the readings may be a little inaccurate.  But even in this case, the device measures the pulse more accurately than gadgets from Garmin or Mio.  In all other modes, the heart rate monitor works almost perfectly. <br><br><h3>  Specifications </h3><br>  <b>Display</b> <br><ul><li>  Shape: rectangular </li><li>  Diagonal, inches: 1.3 </li><li>  Matrix type: TFT </li><li>  Resolution: 240 √ó 240 pixels </li><li>  Density: 261 ppi </li><li>  Protection: Gorilla Glass v3 </li></ul><br>  <b>Hardware</b> <br><ul><li>  Processor: MediaTek MT2601 </li><li>  RAM: 512 MB </li><li>  Built-in memory: 4 GB </li></ul><br>  <b><i>Sensors:</i></b> <br><ul><li>  GPS and GLONASS </li><li>  Accelerometer </li><li>  Heart rate monitor </li><li>  Light sensor </li><li>  Compass </li><li>  Microphone </li></ul><br>  <b>Software</b> <br><ul><li>  Operating system: Android Wear 2.0 </li><li>  Compatibility: iOS 8.2+ / Android 4.3+ </li><li>  Connection Interface: Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi </li></ul><br>  <b>Nutrition</b> <br><ul><li>  Type: Li-Ion </li><li>  Capacity, mAh: 500 </li><li>  Maximum running time: </li></ul><br>  In economy mode: up to 48 hours <br>  With continuous use: up to 8 hours <br><ul><li>  Interface charging: microUSB </li></ul><br>  <b>Housing</b> <br><ul><li>  Enclosure protection: IPX8 </li><li>  Body Material: Plastic </li><li>  Color: black, white </li><li>  Band Material: Silicone </li><li>  Dimensions, mm: 45x36x13 </li><li>  Weight, g: 63 </li></ul><br>  <b>Additionally</b> <br><ul><li>  Notifications: beep and vibration </li><li>  Voice Assistant: Yes </li><li>  Handsfree: Yes </li></ul><br><h3>  As output </h3><br>  Polar M600 watch is a unique device with a large number of functions.
