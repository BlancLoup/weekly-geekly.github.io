      To post not only congratulatory, I want to talk a little about how this holiday is celebrated in the city of Tomsk, and more specifically - in my university ( <a href="http://www.tusur.ru/">TUSUR</a> ), as well as elaborate on one event with a technical interest. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The content of the article: <br><ul><li>  Celebration of the Day of Radio in TUSUR </li><li>  Organization of competitions in cyber football: Fifa 2010 - 2012 </li><li>  Small report from 7/12/2012 </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Celebration of the Day of Radio in TUSUR </h4><br>  Every year, Radio Day becomes one of the most important days in the life of our university.  <a href="http://abiturient.tusur.ru/student/hostel/fables/">They say</a> it all started in the 70s, students with torches for the first time walked around the city (although the reason was slightly different). <br>  It is not surprising, because it is directly related to most specialties in the university.  And as already started, it is celebrated for more than one day, it is usually a whole week (or even more) of various events, such as (I list the current year [ <a href="">billboard</a> , <a href="http://vk.com/doc-38041296_79175228%3Fdl%3D432f7edaa3cfdd9ba8">doc file</a> ]): <br><ul><li>  April 23 - May 2.  ‚ÄúFriendship Train‚Äù - ‚ÄúRadioContact‚Äù </li><li>  1st of May.  Radio VOOM Festival Cup in football, basketball, volleyball, table tennis </li><li>  May 2.  KVN games for the cup of the festival "Radio VOOM" </li><li>  May 3  Beauty contest and talent <a href="http://miss.tusur.ru/">"Miss TUSUR 2012"</a> </li><li>  5 May.  RadioBOOM Festival Cup.

Procession  Closing of the festival (performance of creative teams, drum show ‚ÄúPercussion Project‚Äù, 3-D light show on the building of the main building of TUSUR) </li></ul><br>  Also passes the scientific direction (U.M.NI.K., Scientific session), about them in more detail in the doc-file. <br><br>  By the way, last year we were congratulated on the ISS: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1s8ZFLukbBM&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgI1ubPjzBw-stoWm-0SJxCzdXSHQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And after that, they even <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/reports/iss_reports/2011/05052011.html">appeared</a> on the NASA website. <br><br>  Every year - the traditional dropping of TVs from the 9th floor, fees for a soldering iron by RTF students, sitting down with a guitar, etc.  :) Events vary, there were also radio rally, radio fairs, marathons and something else.  Who wants to come to Tomsk for the first time - come exactly in the first week of May, look for friends of TUSUR students and get positive emotions! <br><br><h4>  Organization of competitions in cyber football: Fifa 2010 - 2012 </h4><br>  Briefly about the idea - the competition in the game Fifa.  Teams from each faculty are gathered, we turn on the fifu, we display everything on the big screen and in addition we get a show! <br><br><h3>  2010  FiFa 2010 </h3><br>  Who can not wait - as it was: <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qxeE8reNhp4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhie5nY-MbNUgnfy9UswvQlq6nxCqA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We collected a team from each faculty (8 teams of 4 people turned out), put 8 cars on the second floor of the <a href="http://sbi.tusur.ru/">SBI</a> , a rear projection projector in the window, a crane with a screen in front of the window. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b11/b43/adc/b11b43adcccae50c77dd736eed11b47b.jpg"><br>  <i>( <a href="http://re.tusur.ru/2010/08/08.html">photo</a> - Radioelectronics' May 17, 2010)</i> <br><br>  Much attention was paid at that time to the rules and bugs of the game.  Rules - on top of those that the game itself prescribes (disconnects, toss up, etc.).  And bugs - such as 100% clogging from the corner.  For those interested - <a href="http://sergeybelove.ru/downloads/fifa-2010-reglament.doc">doc file</a> ). <br>  Commentators had their own, in the breaks between the games there were dance groups and support groups. <br>  Especially nothing to add - all set, set up, waited in the evening and go on, play!  True, there was a problem that it was dark late and the games ended after 11. The <i>necessary</i> people arrived and started to overclock us :) The last matches because of this were muddled and for 2 minutes.  Well, the first pancake - he is.  Although, according to student reviews, everything was cool :) <br><br><h3>  2011.  FiFa 2010 </h3><br>  It so happened that in fife and cars - we have not changed anything.  But we refused to hold this event on the street (cold + problems with time, you need to wait until it gets dark).  And we moved to the action-club "Teatro". <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSnnlxZ9WWI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjl5y7uRIAf507sbq8AB_ovXlZ4gw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Teatro is a two (three?) Storey building, with a large screen and a dancing area.  Plus in each bar plasmas are hung, on which the general video is also displayed.  We placed the players in a separate room on the second floor, set up all the equipment and displayed a picture + a common sound on the common screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/441/ad9/eac/441ad9eac85f8a88546ca8d2425af942.jpg"><br>  <i><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/global_max/" class="user_link">Global_max photo</a></i> <br><br>  The rules of the game remain the same.  But now we could safely play and not wait for the ‚Äúguests‚Äù. <br>  There were 8 cars on the network, the video was output from one where there were two video outputs.  A DVI monitor was connected to the player, and the VGA was hooked to the converter into S-Video / Tulips, which had already gone into the camera for a common signal throughout the club.  In principle, the same as in 2010, except for changing the output image. <br><br><h4>  year 2012.  Fifa-2012 </h4><br>  This year was a step forward.  They took the PlayStation 3, hooked up 6 joysticks (they made the game 3x3), launched the fifa and did the same thing :) The place remains the same - the action-club "Teatro". <br>  The video is not yet, but in fact it will show only another prefix and other performances of creative teams. <br>  But here the interesting moments begin.  The specification of Fifa-2012 PS3 says that the game in the cooperative game supports up to 4 people, and on the network - up to 10 <br>  <a href="http://www.metagames.ru/ps3/game/FIFA_12/">www.metagames.ru/ps3/game/FIFA_12</a> <br>  On the EA site, I did not find the specifications for the PS3 at all.  So - it is not. <br>  Just connected usb hubs and to them - the usual wired usb-joysticks in the amount of 4 pieces + 2 wireless from PS3.  With a larger number, problems begin, that the joysticks simply refuse to work, you may need a hub with additional power, and could not be checked. <br><br>  And what about the output to the screen?  PS3 has 2 video outputs - hdmi and AV.  But in parallel, they can not work, the maximum - for hdmi still give the sound.  I had to simply transplant the players to where there is still plasma (I wrote that the video signal is immediately displayed on all screens in the club) and where no one will interfere with them.  The games were held successfully :) This year they made more qualifiers so as not to delay the games in the club itself and not to tire the viewer. <br>  And in addition to the show - there was also a super-final.  The winning team played with the administration and trade union committee of students :) the <s>characteristics of the second team were slightly overstated and they won</s> It was a lot of fun, in my opinion everything was appreciated:] <br><br><h4>  Small report from 7/12/2012 </h4><br>  Yesterday is over, the organizing committee can finally get some rest, and students can sleep off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3df/102/5e4/3df1025e411f4c4041a98600538c6ef3.jpg"><br>  <i>TV Show</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/788/dde/156/788dde1561eab7e38be7f619088f38e3.jpg"><br>  <i>We throw out TVs :) including</i>  <i>refrigerators and other appliances</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fd7/dc5/4ea/fd7dc54ea75fd2fcc492d882c8869726.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e14/957/cf9/e14957cf9fd95c642793a509dc3c72dc.jpg"><br>  <i>Procession</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2e9/231/8f1/2e92318f16757cee3e8c02dad77c730a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/25f/a0f/7c4/25fa0f7c4d87651323f927d8988e6ddb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/25c/691/00a/25c69100ae5fbab07769a8fc09d682ab.jpg"><br>  <i>Drum show "Percussion Project"</i> <br><br>  <i>Photos with a water-mark "In Tomsk" belong to the portal <a href="http://vtomske.ru/">vtomske.ru</a></i> <br><br>  This year our university is 50 years old, there are a lot of events (more scientific), and this year for the first time on RadioBOOM there was a 3-d show dedicated to our university (the 3-d show with mapping was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/120493/">last year</a> ). <br><br>  Yesterday's 3-d show: <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/IHuWENM0eLY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi0_gKnG3Gq9qazoF-EzV7KvXH70g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And once again - all radio technicians - with the last holiday! <br><br>  <i>PS Ready to answer organizational and technical questions.</i> <br><br>  <b>73 SK</b> <br><br>  upd: Video from the march 2012 <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/pmhj8G8vHYc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjLevLlEZVjdCpKCt8eUWMP8zXWqw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143417/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143417/</a></p>
