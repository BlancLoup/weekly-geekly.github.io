  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How does the support service for shopping services abroad work and develop? Shopotam.ru</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Speaking of large online stores and intermediary services, people sometimes forget about how great the value of support service (support) in a company operating in the field of e-commerce.  But in fact, much remains ‚Äúbehind the scenes‚Äù.  Therefore, we decided to talk about the work of the call center Shopotam.ru, about the difficulties we have to face, what we are doing to overcome these difficulties, and how the support service is developing. <br><br>  <u>What did the service of Shopotam.ru do and do?</u> <br><br>  The scheme of the entire service is simple - the client makes an order, we carry it out: we buy the goods, take them to the warehouse, store and ship them from the warehouse to the addressee.  This simplicity is achieved by a huge number of contacts and interactions.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bec/ec1/023/becec10237f199d387489d153c38d977.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Every day, we accept calls through several channels, including a toll-free hotline, a Moscow city number, a toll-free ‚Äúcall from the site,‚Äù written requests and online chat. <br><br>  Who, in your opinion, is engaged in filling in the accompanying documents for international shipment (parcel) and filing parcels on the wanted list, if the parcels are not tracked?  Of course, support.  If the parcel is lost or the goods arrive damaged, we also organize the payment of the insurance premium. <br><br>  We: <br><br>  * We buy goods; <br>  * We are in correspondence with sellers regarding the timing of delivery of the goods; <br>  * Specify questions about the product (equipment, specifications, color, size, availability, material); <br>  * We open and control the proceedings against unscrupulous sellers; <br>  * We organize a refund to the client according to the results of the proceedings; <br>  * We work with reviews of our clients: in the reviews you give an assessment of our service, write about the problems that have arisen, make suggestions on how to improve the service.  We carefully review your every review; <br>  * We make outgoing calls in order to familiarize our customers with promotions, giving bonuses to pay for goods and services. <br>  * Yes, yes, all this we - support service Shopotam.ru! <br><br>  <u>Difficulties we face</u> <br><br>  1. How to handle a lot of work?  After all, every day we receive several thousand requests, hundreds of requests, there are very unusual situations that require a lot of time to solve. <br><br>  2. How to build work so that it is synchronized with warehouses?  Especially with the US office: the hourly difference is 9 hours, and the support service is Moscow time - we finish the working day, the American warehouse is just starting to work. <br><br>  We concluded that the main task was to distribute the duties between the support staff in such a way as to accept all requests and perform all related work faster and with better quality. <br><br>  <u>Our organizational solutions for work schedules and functionality</u> <br><br>  Here is what we did: <br><br>  * counted the number of calls from customers arriving during the day by the hour; <br>  * built a working schedule of support staff, taking into account the receipt of the number of calls from customers during the day; <br>  * distributed responsibilities among employees, created a specialization: each support employee was responsible for a certain area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork, but, if necessary, could help in the area where the greatest load was observed; <br>  * organized quality control of the information provided; <br>  * created a knowledge base, painted the actions of employees when contacting customers, developed procedures, instructions, service standards; <br>  * began to use an internal corporate resource, where we plan work and place the necessary files.  This facilitated communication among company departments; <br>  * began to regularly carry out certification of knowledge of support staff, to identify weaknesses in knowledge and then conduct training seminars. <br><br>  In order to clearly see our problem areas, we have introduced an <b>analysis of the reasons for the clients to appeal.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e3a/d50/3c8/e3ad503c887d3968dc15421c11ccddb9.jpg"><br><br>  This is how our support department evolves.  Depending on which areas are problematic, we distribute employees by the number and time of working hours.  This is especially important when interacting with warehouses that are located in other time zones. <br><br>  For comparison, here is the difference between our original schedule and how the graph looks at present: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/230/40f/a99/23040fa99dfc01d12968b60509cf96a2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/23e/5ea/bf6/23e5eabf6d5ec44e16b1a3d2ba5cffe1.jpg"><br><br>  The fill colors of the cells indicate the start and end of the work shift, the numbers indicate the duration of the shift. <br><br>  Since our functionality is quite diverse, we separately created a schedule in which we daily distribute support staff for each function: CALLS, CHAT, LETTERS, DECLARATIONS. <br><br>  In order to build a graph correctly, we take into account the customer requests from previous days, we obtain the so-called historical data, on the basis of which we distribute employees by functionals. <br><br>  Changes in the work schedule, the introduction of the functional schedule, the calculation of the need helped us to accept and quickly work out more hits: <br><br>  TICKETS <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/383/a74/c81/383a74c814cfc5e9840c9af867987ada.jpg"><br><br>  CALLS <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cbb/39b/280/cbb39b2805b37dfcea6a7e1a252e6fa3.jpg"><br><br>  DECLARATIONS <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c3a/8ae/84c/c3a8ae84cf3bcf3c8e3eb54e2e0239ab.jpg"><br><br>  <u>And finally ...</u> <br><br>  Of course, there are situations when the number of calls to the support service is very difficult to predict (due to weather conditions, changes in the $ rate, seasonal sales, delays in courier deliveries).  During such periods, we announce overtime work for employees with additional pay.  With the increase in the number of calls, the number of support staff has increased.  Specialization of employees was transformed into departments with a certain functionality and access. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/80d/958/dd6/80d958dd618c107f0cb04b92cfa2fc56.jpg"><br><br>  We are constantly working to improve the speed of processing requests and the quality of work.  We set ourselves the task - the performance of the indicators on average in each hour, and not in a day. <br>  We are grateful to our customers for the feedback on the work of our service - after all, they are the first to notice the shortcomings, inconveniences in using our services - this gives us the opportunity to improve! <br><br>  Recall that for Habr's users Shopotam.ru has a special offer: under the code <b>mf-habrahabr-2013</b> , you will have $ 0 for all incoming and outgoing MF packages until the end of 2013!
