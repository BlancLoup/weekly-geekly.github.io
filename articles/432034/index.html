      About the legendary man - Rudolf Anatolyevich Svoren, we did a series of publications ( <a href="https://habr.com/post/392911/">one</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/company/makeitlab/blog/282105/">two</a> ), including about his wonderful book ‚Äú <b>Electronics step by step</b> ‚Äù, about <a href="https://habr.com/post/394545/">how it changed the lives of people</a> .  Initially, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreprinting this book, beloved by many, was voiced (at the moment we have collected <b>almost 2000 applications</b> from people who are waiting for a reprint). <br><br>  Books by Rudolf Anatolyevich have an amazing quality - the presentation of the material is so accessible and understandable, from simple to complex, that everything becomes ‚Äúon the shelves‚Äù and at the end of the book people really begin to consciously and independently understand the subject. <br><br>  There is good news - in the near future, a new book, <b>Electricity</b> Step by Step, is being prepared for publication, on the KDPV, a picture of it.  This picture shows the integral perception of the world that Rudolf Anatolyevich had - and ‚Äúelectricity‚Äù for him was an important fragment of the Picture of the World, about which he also wanted to tell. <br><br>  The book ‚ÄúElectricity step by step‚Äù has not yet been marketed (although it was ready in 2012), and you have the opportunity to buy a book - to make a pre-order. <br><br>  Details under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But let's start with the sad news - unfortunately, we are forced to tell you the sad news - Rudolf Anatolyevich did not become May 30 of this year, he left our earthly world at 92 year of life. <br><br>  Reprint of his books by R.A.  Svoreny wanted to start with the book "Electricity, step by step."  This is his last work, he finished this book in the fall of 2012.  The first print run was small, it was published by a charitable foundation and distributed to school libraries, and was not sold. <br><br>  Here the author himself speaks about the book: <br><blockquote>  Already from the very first sketches of the book‚Äôs plan, it became clear to the author that it would not be possible to tell everything about electricity that I would like to.  For a long time, electricity has, figuratively speaking, two main professions - it works in the energy sector and in computer science.  Today, the use of electricity in computer science has become a giant field of science, technology, technology, this area is usually called electronics, or just electronics, it combines radio communications, radio broadcasting, television, electronic automation, computing, medical electronics, radar, robotics, and many others independent scientific and technological areas. <br><br>  In order not to switch to the patter and not exceed a reasonable volume of the book, the traditional structure of textbooks of electrical engineering was chosen for it: the book describes the electrical circuits of direct and alternating current and the use of electricity in the power industry.  On the use of electricity in computer science in such textbooks, as a rule, they are spoken very sparingly, and sometimes they do not even remember.  And in this book electronics are given relatively little space (one chapter out of twenty), and this topic is introduced mainly to remind of its existence.  Electricity in computer science is such a large and diverse field that even a not very detailed story about it would require a separate book more of this one.  The author hopes in the foreseeable future to prepare such a book, thus completing the begun story about electricity. </blockquote><br>  Following the will of the author, his heirs concluded a contract for the priority publication of this particular book - ‚ÄúElectricity, step by step‚Äù.  In the near future she leaves the printing house.  You can make a preliminary order on the website of the publishing house DMK-Press. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Here is a direct link hidden</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="https://dmkpress.com/catalog/electronics/textbooks/978-5-97060-604-9/">dmkpress.com/catalog/electronics/textbooks/978-5-97060-604-9</a> <br></div></div><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/el/wo/yz/elwoyzs4kzqgneydqdzo6ltay08.jpeg"><br><br>  This book does not repeat the content of ‚ÄúElectronics step by step,‚Äù but it perfectly complements it in terms of theoretical knowledge of electrical engineering.  On the website of the publisher you can download an <a href="https://dmkpress.com/files/PDF/978-5-97060-604-9.pdf">introductory fragment</a> . <br><br>  The book is quite voluminous - 460 pages, hardcover.  Format: 160 x 220 mm, print - two-color.  Paper - offset, so the weight of the book will be considerable 800 grams. <br><br>  The legendary "Electronics step by step," of course, is also planned to be re-edited.  We will tell about the details in the following publications. <br><br>  Content of the book ‚ÄúElectricity step by step‚Äù: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Open</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> CHAPTER 1. Ten Important Warnings <br>  T-1.  It may well be that - the reader does not need this book at all. <br>  T-2.  At the same time, there are quite a few people who cannot do without acquaintance with electricity, and the book will help to take the first steps in this matter. <br>  T-3.  Many will get real benefit from acquaintance with electricity, although they are not directly connected with it. <br>  T-4.  It is useful to know something about electricity even to those who hate exact sciences and are not at all interested in technology. <br>  T-5.  The book offered to the reader is, so to speak, multi-storey, in particular, there are thematic floors of different levels of complexity. <br>  T-6.  The reader may, in varying sequences, become familiar with sections of the book. <br>  T-7.  The book is written in several different languages; to master them is to make the most important step in the study of electricity. <br>  T-8.  Much of the book is presented in a simplified way, and something very simplistic, and maybe even too simplistic. <br>  T-9.  The author should warn that the book has a serious flaw, it could not be avoided, but in the future, I hope, it will be possible to fix it. <br>  T-10.  The reader receives the last and most important warning. <br><br>  CHAPTER 2. Where lives and how does the amber force <br>  T-11.  Everyone met with electricity, but far from everyone dares to explain what it is <br>  T-12.  The world in which we live is much more complex than it seems at first glance. <br>  T-13.  The history of man and mankind in seven paragraphs <br>  T-14.  People did not quickly figure out how it works in nature. <br>  T-15.  On the time scale compressed 30 million times, the discovery of America happened about 8 minutes ago. <br>  T-16.  Along with countless questions that can be answered in detail and specifically, there are several "why?", Allowing so far only one answer: "This is how our world works." <br>  T-17.  Electricity is one of the most important values ‚Äã‚Äãof our world, one of the main forces acting in it. <br>  T-18.  At its birth, our Universe was such <br>  that almost all atomic particles have mass, <br>  and some also have electric charge <br>  T-19.  Man is looking for helpers <br>  T-20.  There are several types of fundamental forces in nature, electricity is one of them <br>  T-21.  You just need to get used to electricity, as we are accustomed from birth to gravity <br>  T-22.  Electricity is of two kinds, two types, and they have come up with the following names: ‚Äúpositive electricity‚Äù and ‚Äúnegative electricity‚Äù <br>  T-23.  In electrified sticks, some molecules feel an electric charge <br>  T-24.  In search of an elementary, that is, the smallest in nature, electrical charge, we disassemble the molecule into atoms. <br>  T-25.  A few commendable words to models and modeling <br>  T-26.  Planetary model of an atom in the center of a massive nucleus, electrons rotate around it <br>  T-27.  The current model of the hydrogen atom <br>  T-28.  Atomic particles electron and proton contain the smallest portions of electric charges <br>  T-29.  Atoms of different chemical elements differ in the number of protons in the nucleus <br>  T-30.  Positive ion and negative ion - atoms, in which the electrical equilibrium is broken and there are more charges (+ or -) in them <br>  T-31.  Electric forces could work in cars <br><br>  CHAPTER 3. Plant where electrons work <br>  T-32.  Much of what has been and will be said is a great lie, since it does not mention the existence of quantum mechanics. <br>  T-33.  Electrons and ions can be in a free state and move in the interatomic space <br>  T-34.  Electrons and (or) ions involved in electrical current can create heat and light, as well as move matter <br>  T-35.  Conductors, semiconductors, insulators - substances with different contents of free electric charges <br>  T-36.  The generator and the load - the main elements of the electrical circuit <br>  T-37.  Rubbed plastic and glass rods as a generator, metal conductor as a load <br>  T-38.  Along with the substance, there is such a matter as the field <br>  T-39 Anyone who wants to feel free in the electric kingdom must certainly learn to complement the simple picture of the world that has opened to him. <br>  T-40.  Already the ancient Greeks, continuing their experiments, could create an electric current in a conductor - the orderly movement of electrons <br>  T-41.  Chemical Generator - First Meet <br>  T-42.  Flashlight - the simplest real electric <br>  chain <br><br>  CHAPTER 4. No need to be afraid of the question "how much?" <br>  T-43.  It is sometimes necessary to tell about an electrical circuit <br>  words and numbers <br>  T-44.  Unit of electric charge - pendant (K) <br>  T-45.  Unit current - ampere (A) <br>  T-46.  When meeting with the word "power", you need to remember that it can have several different meanings. <br>  T-47.  The system of units is a set of interconnected units of measurement, which, along with its fundamental advantages, allows to simplify calculations <br>  T-48.  Unit of force (weight) - Newton (N) <br>  T-49.  Unit of Work and Energy - Joule (J) <br>  T-50.  Power unit - watt (W) <br>  T-51.  Sometimes work or energy is indicated not in joules, but in watt-seconds or kilowatt-hours <br>  T-52.  Unit of electromotive force - volt (V) <br>  T-53.  Unit of electrical resistance - ohm (ohm) <br>  T-54.  Unit of Voltage - Volt (V) <br>  T-55.  Knowing the basic unit of measurement, you can easily get <br>  smaller and larger units <br><br>  CHAPTER 5. The Constitution of the electrical circuit <br>  T-56.  Ohm's law is one of the very simple, clear and at the same time very important laws of an electrical circuit. <br>  T-57.  On some difference between the law on the protection of copyright and the law of world wideness <br>  T-58.  The law must know for sure <br>  T-59.  Formulas are a short and convenient way to record the effects of some values ‚Äã‚Äãon others. <br>  T-60.  Glancing at the formula, you can immediately see which value depends on which and how <br>  T-61.  From the basic formula of Ohm's law one can obtain two convenient calculation formulas for calculating the emf.  E and resistance R <br>  T-62.  Resistance (resistor) - a part whose main task is to provide a certain resistance to electric current <br>  T-63.  In the form of resistors (resistances) on the schemes often display a variety of devices, devices and circuit elements <br>  T-64.  Attempt to look inside the electrical circuit to understand the situation at the borders.  T-65.  In all sections of the series circuit, the current strength is the same. <br>  T-66.  Having forgotten for some time about electricity, we take a sled and go in search of a suitable snow slide. <br>  T-67.  The excess charges created by the generator are automatically distributed in a series circuit so that the current is the same everywhere <br>  T-68.  The electromotive force of the generator is divided between parts of a series circuit, a part of the emf, inherited by some of them, is called the voltage U in this area and is measured in volts (V) <br>  T-69.  Efficiency (in volts) at any point in an electrical circuit or electric field is often called its potential. <br>  T-70.  On any part of the electrical circuit, Ohm‚Äôs law is in effect the same as Ohm‚Äôs law for the whole circuit. <br>  T-71.  The voltage U in the circuit section depends on the strength of the current I, which passes through this section, and on its resistance R. <br><br>  CHAPTER 6. Think in the language of electrical circuits. <br>  T-72.  Conditional current direction - from ‚Äúplus‚Äù to ‚Äúminus‚Äù <br>  T-73.  Determining the strength of the current, it is necessary to take into account all moving charges. <br>  T-74.  With parallel connection of resistors, their total resistance is less than the lowest <br>  T-75.  Power in the electric circuit - the product of current and voltage <br>  T-76.  Some useful grammar rules for electrical circuit language <br>  T-77.  Several useful images for the language of electrical circuits <br>  T-78.  Serial circuit - voltage divider, parallel - current divider.  T-79.  Special dividers - shunt and incremental and resistance <br>  T-80.  To increase the load, you need to reduce the load resistance <br>  T-81.  The voltage at the output of the generator is always less than emf, and it decreases with increasing load <br>  T-82.  Electrical Engineering - the science of contacts <br>  T-83.  Voltmeter, ammeter and ohmmeter - devices for measuring the emf  (voltage), current and resistance. <br>  T-84.  Complex electrical circuit - a system of series and parallel connected elements <br>  T-85.  Changing any element of a complex circuit, you need to understand how the currents and voltages will change in different parts of it. <br>  T-86.  Considering the complex electrical circuit, it is very important not to lose confidence that you can understand everything in the end. <br>  T-87.  The main acting force will not stay in the background for long <br><br>  CHAPTER 7. Born by movement. <br>  T-88.  With magnetic forces, as well as with gravitational and electric, the easiest way to meet in the simplest experiments <br>  T-89.  The ‚ÄúNorth‚Äù and ‚ÄúSouth‚Äù poles of the magnet are two areas with particularly pronounced magnetic properties, but with properties of different types. <br>  T-90.  Polarization is a physical phenomenon that explains some mysterious electrical and magnetic processes. <br>  T-91.  The magnetic field, it turns out, can be obtained by waving a rubbed plastic stick <br>  T-92.  The magnetic field is always closed. <br>  T-93.  A simple invention transforms a conductor with current into a rod magnet with pronounced poles - the north and south <br>  T-94.  Coil: the current passes through several turns of the wire in succession and their magnetic fields are summed. <br>  T-95.  Ferromagnetic and paramagnetic substances in varying degrees enhance the magnetic field, diamagnetic weaken it <br>  T-96.  The main characteristics of the magnetic field are H strength, magnetic induction B and magnetic flux F <br>  T-97.  The path that closes a magnetic field is often <br>  called a magnetic circuit <br>  T-98.  In electrical devices and apparatus often magnetic elements <br>  T-99.  The strange behavior of the ferromagnetic core causes some troubles and at the same time the basis for remarkable inventions. <br><br>  CHAPTER 8. Parade of great transformations. <br>  T-100.  All the variety of electric motors, all their innumerable quantities originate from a discovery made about 200 years ago. <br>  T-101.  The left-hand rule lets you know where a conductor with current is moving, placed in a magnetic field. <br>  T-102.  In a conductor that moves in a magnetic field, an electromotive force is induced (induced) <br>  T-103.  The right-hand rule indicates the direction of the emf.  and the current that will appear in the conductor, if it is moved in a magnetic field <br>  T-104.  The faster the conductor crosses the magnetic field, the greater the emf induced in this conductor. <br>  T-105.  To increase the induced emf  you can roll the conductor into the coil or (and) quickly change the magnetic field <br>  T-106.  In many processes, the decisive role is not played by the value of any value itself, but by the speed of its change. <br>  T-107.  Variation of electromagnetic induction - mutual induction <br>  T-108.  Another type of electromagnetic induction is self-induction. <br><br>  CHAPTER 9. A brief tour of the fields <br>  T-110.  The coil stores energy in its magnetic field. <br>  T-111.  The capacitor stores energy in its electric field. <br>  T-112.  Electric capacity characterizes the ability of a capacitor, and in general of any physical body, to accumulate electric charges.  Unit of Capacity - Farad, F. <br>  T-113.  A capacitor, when combined with a resistor, can become an element of timing <br>  T-114.  The free electric charges, creating a current, move very slowly, but the electric and magnetic fields rush at the speed of light. <br>  T-115.  The conductor, crossing the magnetic field, indicates the direct path to the creation of electric generators. <br>  T-116.  Any power unit, including an electric generator, does not create anything by itself, it only converts one type of energy into another <br><br>  CHAPTER 10. Constant AC Volatility <br>  T-117.  If a conductor is uniformly rotated in a magnetic field, then a variable sinusoidal emf is induced in it. <br>  T-118.  Schedule - a special picture, clearly showing how one of any value depends on another <br>  T-119.  A graph of a variable electromotive force shows how it changes over time. <br>  T-120.  Under the action of the variable emf.  alternating current is flowing in the circuit, and alternating voltages are active in all its parts <br>  T-121.  AC power can work as well as constant current. <br>  T-122.  It's nice to meet technical terms in the form of words of the native language: the frequency indicates how often the full cycle of alternating current repeats.  Unit of frequency - hertz, Hz <br>  T-123.  ‚ÄúInstantaneous‚Äù and ‚Äúamplitude‚Äù report the availability of alternating current at some specific point. <br>  T-124.  In order to assess the operability of alternating current on average for a long time, the ‚Äúeffective value‚Äù characteristic was invented for it <br>  T-125.  Phase and phase shift should be indicated, calling the exact time, and it is customary to indicate it not in seconds, but in degrees <br>  T-126.  Active resistance: current and voltage are in phase <br>  T-127.  Under the action of alternating voltage through the coil inductance alternating current flows <br>  T-128.  Under the action of alternating voltage in the circuit of the capacitor alternating current flows <br>  T-129.  The remarkable mathematical curve of the sinusoid was obtained by ancient mathematicians as a result of simple geometric constructions <br>  T-130.  Born from purely geometric constructions, a sine wave, as it turned out, describes many very different processes, including electrical <br>  T-131.  The rate of change of the sinusoidal voltage (emf, current) also varies sinusoidally <br><br>  CHAPTER 11. Expected surprises <br>  T-132.  A sinusoidal voltage creates a sinusoidal current through a capacitor;  the current leads the voltage (or, otherwise, the voltage lags the current) by 90 degrees <br>  T-133.  The capacitance resistance Xc, like R, measured in omaha indicates what the current will be at a given voltage, but does not consume Xc power <br>  T-134.  The description of phase shifts is often sharply criticized by readers who have forgotten that such shifts are not just there, but they are quite understandable. <br>  T-135.  Inductive resistance XL, as usual <br>  active resistance R indicates what the current will be at a given voltage, however, unlike R, the power XL does not consume <br>  T-136.  The inductive resistance XL of the coil and its active resistance R cannot simply be folded to calculate their total resistance <br>  T-137.  A vector diagram helps to visualize and quantify many processes, including in AC circuits. <br><br>  CHAPTER 12. Seven simplest complex AC circuits <br>  T-138.  Of the seven complex circuits included in the list, we are left to meet with only three <br>  T-139.  Voltage acting on RC or RL serial circuits can be found using vector diagrams. <br>  T-140.  With a parallel connection of RC or RL elements, the vector diagram is based on the total voltage, not the total current <br>  T-141.  On the vector diagram, it is easy to take into account the appearance of the third element and the formation of a serial or parallel LCR circuit. <br>  T-142.  Reactive resistances L and C strongly depend on the frequency, and when it changes in the circuits with L or C, the voltages, currents and phase shifts change <br>  T-143.  In the electrical circuit can simultaneously flow many alternating currents of different frequencies, in order to isolate or suppress any of them, use filters. <br><br>  CHAPTER 13. Description of the indescribable <br>  T-144.  Everything told about alternating current refers only to one of its versions - to sinusoidal current. <br>  T-145.  An AC spectrum of complex shape is an equivalent set of sinusoidal currents with different frequencies and amplitudes. <br>  T-146.  Extraneous alternating currents can interfere with and distort information carried by electrical signals. <br>  T-147.  With the help of capacitors and coils, you can create filters - electrical circuits that differently pass currents of different frequencies <br>  T-148.  Frequency response - a graph that tells how an electrical circuit behaves at different frequencies. <br>  T-149.  The transfer ratio shows how many times the voltage or current at the output is greater or less than at the input. <br>  T-150.  Decibel is a universal unit, showing how many times a quantity is greater or less than another. <br><br>  CHAPTER 14. In the world of swinging pendulums <br>  T-151.  You touched the guitar string, and she sang a hymn to free vibrations. <br>  T-152.  In the oscillatory circuit, energy is exchanged between the capacitor C and the inductance L <br>  T-153.  In serial LCR circuit, inductive resistance <br>  acts against capacitive <br>  T-154.  At the resonant frequency, the total resistance of the sequential LCR circuit drops sharply, and the current in it sharply increases. <br>  T-155.  At the resonant frequency, the resistance of the parallel LCR circuit increases dramatically. <br>  T-156.  Why is the resonant frequency called resonant? <br><br>  CHAPTER 15. Small tricks of big energy <br>  T-157.  A transformer transfers energy from one electrical circuit to another without direct contact between them. <br>  T-158.  A transformer increases either voltage or current, in no case, however, without increasing power. <br>  T-159.  Load resistance in the secondary circuit <br>  transformer determines the mode of its primary circuit - creates in it the insertion resistance <br>  T-160.  Temperature condition of the operating transformer: "cold" - "warm -" hot "-" the smoke "went <br>  T-161.  Amazing professions of a simple conductor - superconductivity and skin effect <br>  T-162.
