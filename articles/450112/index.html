In addition to the names that have already become synonymous with luggage accessories, such as ‚ÄúSamsonite‚Äù or ‚ÄúToumi‚Äù, luggage and travel bags will be found in the collections of almost every prestigious clothing brand.

      What is really surprising: there are all kinds of materials, colors, sizes!  It is time to amaze with forms and functionality. <br><br>  For category (good, it is small) "geek-suitcases" we looked for a long time.  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/madrobots/blog/373797/">Bluesmart was</a> especially impressive at first - the GPS suitcase for business trips, which, of course, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/madrobots/blog/412191/">could not stand</a> under the onslaught of prohibitions.  Now we are impressed by the Cowarobot - a suitcase, <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/cowarobot.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dbagag%26utm_campaign%3Dcowarobot">worth under 90 thousand rubles</a> , which can itself go after its owner.  Wow, you can't tell otherwise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dm/gc/jy/dmgcjymyoxfz9zp28hpqzs2jcee.gif"><br><br>  But this, of course, is something semi-fantastic.  Much more will be recruited strange "polumimodanov" with simpler features.  But the main idea is to optimize the movement of a suitcase in space.  Who wants to roll a suitcase?  Moreover, he would not only drive, but also drive us, right?  This is how the category of chemokat for adults and children originated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w5/6t/gp/w56tgpfshuwo7khdejiagj9txxs.jpeg"><br><br>  And they are also already a great many for every taste / color / wallet.  Adults, judging by the city traffic, love scooters, so there is nothing surprising in the fact that such ‚Äúsuitcase-transport‚Äù may well take root in the age group of 30+, it seems, no. <br><br>  But it is obvious that children like this will be the way no less.  A quick look at any shopping center now, at the beginning of May, perfectly confirms this hypothesis: there is a scooter in almost any, the most unexpected storefront. <br><br>  <b>Children's suitcases - are they needed at all?</b> <br><br>  Of course yes.  This will probably be obvious to everyone who has ever traveled with the child to rest.  Until he collects all his favorite toys, which are recruited a lot, he will not budge.  To this we add the necessary minimum of clothes, which, often, the child has much more, and it turns out that this is always plus one more suitcase. <br><br>  Some of the things, at least the toys, can be perfectly repacked into a separate ‚Äúbundle‚Äù and reassign it to the child.  Manufacturers are not shy, and one of the key characteristics in describing children's suitcases indicate ‚Äúpedagogical influence‚Äù, help to parents, training for work and responsibility for their things.  Why not? <br><br>  But at the same time, of course, the usual suitcase is boring.  The child will start feeling sad and burdened.  Therefore, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa transport suitcase seems understandable. <br><br>  But unlike other "fellow" ZINC suitcase designed for the fact that the child will spend time with him constantly and independently.  We have already written, for example, about the children's suitcase-crib. <br><br><blockquote>  JetKids BedBox - <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/411963/">baby suitcase-bed for little travelers</a> </blockquote><br>  It is also a "vehicle" means, however, it is rather built on the principle of a runbike.  A child, when tired of such a suitcase, sits on top, and his parents are taking him.  Great help. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k6/m1/8y/k6m18yudvgjomd4jnn4wjidmubs.gif"><br><br>  Trunki suitcases are made on the same principle ( <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/chemodan-na-kolesikah-edinorog-una-goluboi-trunki.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dbagag%26utm_campaign%3Dtrunki">for example</a> ).  However, it seems that riding a horse will quickly become bored, and such a suitcase will soon be in the hands of a father or mother. <br><br>  <b>ZINC - scooter case</b> <br><br>  Children love scooters, they like to ride, so most likely the transportation of their luggage will not complicate them.  Suitcase made soundly.  And the suitcase itself, and the design of the scooter is very decent and reliable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ca/zp/72/cazp72nz1dpj7n1ymuuvwh8g8xi.jpeg"><br><br>  The suitcase is made of durable, shock-resistant nylon material.  The lower part, or back, slightly softer, it flexes.  The lid of the suitcase is tight and holds its shape perfectly.  Suitcase zip divided into two parts: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xs/0j/i8/xs0ji8jms5clnvf4lnwyzskw5e0.jpeg"><br><br>  It opens "forward."  The total volume of the suitcase 25 liters.  On the back, as it should be, constriction, which additionally fixes the state of things inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xs/0j/i8/xs0ji8jms5clnvf4lnwyzskw5e0.jpeg"><br><br>  On the inside lid there is an additional zip pocket. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ti/po/xk/tipoxkwkfes6jsdhi0id34nqudu.jpeg"><br><br>  The zipper itself looks reliable, it has a smooth ride, and it will be convenient for the child to open and close the suitcase.  But it is not very tight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_g/mp/5s/_gmp5s9fgnrfbrieux_96vmxfss.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, ZINC as a suitcase looks very good, and you can take it with you on a trip. <br><br>  <b>Suitcase like scooter</b> <br><br>  Here, in terms of reliability, everything is also not bad.  The body of the scooter is made of durable metal, all materials are well-fitted, nothing dangles anywhere. <br><br>  The wheel of the scooter, which also handles the suitcase, is extended and has a double fixation.  From the outside, which does not allow him to fall down: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ki/ot/eo/kioteouc4nodlo8wtytqolxnadm.jpeg"><br><br>  And from the inside, which does not allow the steering wheel to fall up, if you pull it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hw/1u/7y/hw1u7y5ydhsd92-qcpmviqizpca.jpeg"><br><br>  The handle is hidden inside the main compartment under the zipper.  The length of the visible part of the handle is 75 cm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/yn/uk/59ynuk3mjtrykp5lykqgza7swdc.jpeg"><br><br>  The surface of the handle as steering done well.  It is covered with soft comfortable inserts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cs/fg/-l/csfg-le1cxasyntdfwddb3goela.jpeg"><br><br>  ZINC - a three-wheeled suitcase.  It provides stability, safety of movement.  Also, two front wheels are suitcase wheels, not just a scooter, and so it is convenient to carry it when folded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ys/zp/2w/yszp2wlmfam5lw7ozsrcrzjayuu.jpeg"><br><br>  The rear wheel is slightly smaller in diameter.  The scooter is equipped with a foot brake. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8g/tr/pk/8gtrpkigagzs8bt7kg9ibwmnpks.jpeg"><br><br>  By itself, the children's suitcase is not very high, it dictated the size of the site - it is 35 cm long. It is impossible for an adult to stand on it.  However, such a scooter has weight limits - up to 50 kg. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lo/q1/75/loq175v8xverugo55aiuukfjiuq.jpeg"><br><br>  The surface is rough, not slippery.  When folded, it slightly sinks into the back, for which there is a special cavity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tw/y3/0k/twy30k23znobmxnnibcqbut3noe.jpeg"><br><br>  To disassemble a suitcase in a scooter, you need to slightly pull up.  It's all quite simple, but securely fixed - on the road spontaneously ZINC does not transform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ka/pe/rp/kaperpauwm0kjlvqf2pr44qkmfu.gif"><br><br>  You can also see an additional locking hook.  In order to fold the suitcase, you must also slightly pull on yourself. <br><br>  The control here is not rotary, but inclined.  In order to turn left / right, you need to slightly tilt the handle in one direction or another. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oo/d7/yk/ood7yk3uwwaac4_v7cxqgm6g0n4.gif"><br><br>  <b>General conclusions</b> <br><br>  ZINC has a good assortment, but this model - a <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/zc03909.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dbagag%26utm_campaign%3Dzinc">pink owl</a> - is obviously mostly aimed at little girls. <br><br>  The device is made quite well as a suitcase, and as a scooter.  All materials are reliable and the victims in favor of one or another design feature is not observed.  True, obviously, if you load a suitcase, decompose and not stand on it - it will roll forward. <br><br>  The volume of the suitcase should be enough for toys, books, coloring books.  Older children will perfectly fit their belongings there.  Such a scooter, of course, is not suitable for walking, but can be a very useful companion in a family trip.  Suitcase weight approx.  4.7 kg. <br><br>  Good to you May! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450112/</a></p>
