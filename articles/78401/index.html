  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Learning 3.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Everyone who has ever studied at a university, institute and other institutions of higher education is familiar with the standard teaching model: seminar - lecture.  Some people like it, some don't, but there's nothing you can do because  this is the foundation of education.  Although sometimes teachers come across who distort this paradigm.  Personally, I got such a copy, and this is the head.  our department of information security.  He immediately offered us to conduct lectures in the form of a conversation - where he told us, and we did not write anything, but only listened to him and if there was a need, asked questions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, it was convenient that his personal book was attached to the subject, where everything he said was described in detail. <br><br>  At home, we all (ideally of course) read in detail, and already at the seminar they told him how they understood everything he was talking about.  So I wanted to tell you that such a model of education is much better (and everyone knows that) than the standard one, under which he would mumble a dictation from his book, which can be read anyway.  And precisely because of this kind of teaching, I learned the material better and more qualitatively (after all, ‚Äúintellectual‚Äù works in this way). <br><br>  In the general scheme, the idea can be expressed as:

Ideally, there should be implemented useful functions such as student attendance statistics (percentage and graphs), sections devoted to each subject, where you can find a lot of useful information: the same lectures, multimedia materials (such as video of the physical process), various testing and training systems (Especially in chemistry, you can make a whole formula builder like on a nigma). <br>  After the student is prepared, he goes to the seminar and the teacher conducts seminar 3.0 with the group, which differs from the obsolete one only in that it rigidly imposes the rules for its conduct.  This means that no Vasily Petrovich or Anna Ivanovna will be able to turn the seminar into a farce and punitive time where the teacher is silent as a donkey and gives only estimates.  And it should take place in the form of a type: what do you think, can you decide?  And if you need to explain something again, it is done immediately.  Let's say using the same multimedia.  A student who is not ready just should not come to class.  This eliminates excess meat which only hinders. <br><br>  Of course, I didn‚Äôt discover the galaxy, and this is probably another invention of the bicycle, but we only have one subject in this way, and that‚Äôs just because we‚Äôve caught such a teacher.  Well, all other items are like a dead, boring event. <br><br>  Thank you habrachelovek! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78401/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78401/</a></p>
