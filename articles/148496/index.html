Summer, hot, and most importantly - boring.  We are engaged in email marketing.  So who else if not we need to come up with something interesting and play?  The UniSender team jointly reviewed the cartoon "Plasticine Crow" and was inspired by the idea to also someone to learn a large saddle, a carpet and a TV.  If you want - take away.  And now we will tell you what to do. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Remember the little song?  Or maybe a crow ... pam-pam-pam-pam-pam-pam-pam ... Or maybe a split test?  If you are on duty, sending a mailing to a fairly large database - at least 500 addresses, then you have almost taken part in our competition!  Just show us your newsletter, and the winners will be chosen by Facebook users and the expert jury of Unisender.  Of course, it should not be any mailing, but it is beautiful and it was carried out in split-testing mode with the subsequent determination of the winning letter. <br><br><h4>  Split test </h4><br>  For some time now, the UniSender functionality allows for split-testing in a very convenient format.  You can test various headings, subheadings, the content of the letter, the location of links and calls to action.  In principle, you can test anything, and we have written quite a bit about it.  However, remember the important point that two letters should differ only by one parameter, which is compared.  Because if you change more than one parameter in the letters under test, it will be unclear what exactly the customers liked, and therefore it will be difficult to draw analytically and logically correct conclusions.

    <h4>  Your newsletter </h4><br>  So, you send your next newsletter.  Have you determined the parameter by which you will split?  Then fight!  Post to the test group, determine the winning letter and complete your daily marketing work.  On this routine is over, it began the most interesting!  When you test, do this: <br><br>  1. Screenshots of letters - we hope that we will see quite clean and minimalist, and at the same time beautifully designed letters, taking into account all the rules of good mailings, about which we write every day in our blog on Facebook. <br><br>  2. Statistics screenshots - your base should not be small, at least 500 clients.  Then your statistics will look quite representative and beautiful. <br><br>  3. Paint / smear in them strategically important information about you, leave only the appearance and content - turnouts and passwords are not important for us.  Therefore, you can blur them in SnagIt, for example. <br><br>  4. Write a couple (or maybe not a couple) of words explaining this beauty (or maybe half a kilo!) - The main thing in split testing is correctly made conclusions from the statistics that you finally got.  Formulate what helped you to split-test to understand about your database and what successful elements you may transfer to the following mailings. <br><br>  5. Everything!  <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/contest/vorona/">Send your "case" to us</a> ! <br><br><h4>  Your victory </h4><br>  As it was sung in the song, ‚Äúthe saddle is big, the carpet and the TV will immediately be presented as a gift, or maybe handed over.‚Äù  More specifically, it will be this: <br><br>  1 place, determined by Facebook users and expert jury UniSender deserves no less than a scooter!
