I bought myself somehow to organize a wonderful GeForce video card in a beautiful box, where in addition to the actual card there were also glasses with LCD shutters ... <a name="habracut"></a><br>  For those born in the USSR, this was not the first acquaintance with stereoscopy.  In childhood there were stereo slides and trips to the stereo cinema, so seeing 3D games directly in 3D was at least interesting. <br>  But the idea is really good, the games used OpenGL and Direct3D and nVidia was not difficult, changing the position of the ‚Äúcamera‚Äù in the game to get perspectives for the right and left eyes, even if the creators of the game did not even think about it.  Of course, there were problems with the menu, game indicators and a sight, they still pursue stereoscopy lovers, although the developers of the so-called ‚Äú3D drivers‚Äù and nVidia among them, manage to fight it, and not without success ... <br><br>  However, with the death of CRT displays, the topic of stereoscopic games on personal computers has stalled.  Yes, and not very attractive she looked, due to a strong drop in brightness and noticeable flicker.  In addition, there was no pronounced ‚Äúwow effect‚Äù like in a movie theater. <br>  Like modern 3D monitors and televisions, the three-dimensional image floated somewhere in the depths of the monitor, as in an aquarium and almost didn‚Äôt go out, that hired trolls wouldn‚Äôt write on hardware forums, so the effect of volume is related to the screen size, so in any portable devices with 3D screens there is no special meaning ... <br>  And then at least two reasons, the first is that the illusion of volume is created by the presence of horizontal parallax of the image angles.  Accordingly, when the image is zoomed, the scale of the screen parallaxes changes accordingly, and as a result the volume illusion created by the parallaxes.  These are not some psychological features of visual perception, they are ordinary mathematics, stupid and merciless. <br>  However, the aforementioned psychological features of image perception are just the second reason, heating objects with negative screen parallaxes (going beyond the screen) to the surface of the screen.  Well, do not want the human mind, being in their right mind and sober mind to see the image beyond the screen.  "Cats can not, not allowed" - in a professional stereo movie this is called "The pressing effect of the edge of the screen." <br>  In the cinema, this problem is solved simply, with a large screen that overlaps the viewer's viewpoint, so even massive objects can be dramatically brought into the space of the hall, and any contrasting sparks, stars, splashes and drops of blood will be readily scattered throughout the hall :-) <br><br>  But let us return to ours today, and today we have a lot of 3D TVs, monitors and projectors that have become so affordable that I, for the reasons outlined above, don‚Äôt see much sense in TVs and monitors. <br>  IMHO is the only chip of 3D TVs in that they are capable of reproducing a stereo image in anamorphic ‚Äúside by side‚Äù and ‚Äúover-under‚Äù formats.  Thus, you can watch 3D movies from a regular DVD or downloaded from the Internet without any special problems.  I remember watching 3D videos from YouTube on a TV from a friend, long before 3D Vision support appeared, I simply turned it over to full screen and turned on the TV in ‚Äúside by side‚Äù.  And although anamorphic "side by side" IMHO is evil and trash, today it is the de facto standard.  It has satellite 3D channels, it records the majority of household 3D cameras and cameras, 3D films are walking on it. <br>  However, with the same success, 3D movies can be viewed on the computer, for Windows and Linux there is a wonderful free program of Cyril Gavrilov <a href="http://www.sview.ru/">www.sview.ru</a> <br>  Of the paid programs, the most popular StereoscopicPlayer <a href="http://3dtv.at/">3dtv.at</a> it also allows you to play BlueRay3D discs and not protected cinema containers. <br>  For owners of nVidia 3D Vision, there is a free version of Stereoscopic, and in general, nVidia impresses with its simplicity and readiness to use the system out of the box, but it is not by chance that the toad and the nVidia logo are the same color.  3D vision sets are not cheap at all, and after some version of drivers, they work only with relatively new nVidia video cards, although before, everything worked perfectly even on ION, not in terms of games, but it was possible to watch the movie, not like now: - (Another manifestation of the nVidia toad is that if you use a prector / TV / monitor for which you already have the corresponding glasses, you still need to buy a 3D Vision set. At least in this situation, nVidia glasses sometimes work in this situation, otherwise, it is completely disappointing, given the not small cost of the original  nVidia's cove. However, the need for invention is tricky, and the Chinese brothers didn‚Äôt have to wait long. Usually, Chinese crafts associate with something primitive, much inferior to the original. And in this regard, 3D Vision sets from PALMEXX frankly amazed me, because by comparison with them, the original 3D Vision kits from nVidia do not look good, crooked and damp! I will not go into the details of the circuit design, about which technically literate people are already <a href="">drawing demotivators</a> . <br>  I will say as a simple consumer.  The set from nVidia consists of a ‚Äúpyramid‚Äù on which the control wheel and the glasses itself are located, since the connection between them is infrared, the ‚Äúpyramid‚Äù must be within sight, if you use a 3D monitor, there will be no special problems with this, but with the projector will have to dance.  And you will have to dance with a tambourine, because the ‚Äúpyramid‚Äù has a bad attitude to USB extenders and hubs :-) Points from nVidia are not bad, but two comrades have already died, and the LCD shutter has failed in a very strange way, with fully working electronics.

      Unlike the original nVidia 3D Vision PALMEXX 3D PX-203 KIT clone, even the language does not turn to be called a clone, because besides the <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3D3D%2B%25D0%259E%25D0%25A7%25D0%259A%25D0%2598%2BPALMEXX%2B3D%2BPX-203%2BKIT%2B%2528%2BNVIDIA%2B3D%2BVISION%2BKIT%2BWIRALESS%2BRADIO%2B2%252C4%2BGHZ%2529">affordable price</a> it uses a 2.4GHz two-way radio channel, that is, you can drop the pyramid behind the system unit and forget about its existence, the control buttons eat right on the glasses! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf6/45c/fff/bf645cfff03097704cf8b02a7a885051.jpg" align="right"><br>  They are not buggy, do not fall off, and out of 40 points, over the course of half a year I only once encountered a breakdown, in the form of a retreated LCD shutter cable, which was safely plugged back and plugged.  (In the original nVidia, the cables are glued / welded and the hell knows how to fix them.) In general, after the ordeals with nVidia 3D Vision, I still go under the impression of PALMEXX, there are no words, only emotions, and positive ones! <br><br>  ‚ÄúPyramids‚Äù and PALMEXX glasses are sold without any problems, either as a set or <a href="http://www.store3d.ru/shop/UID_44.html">separately,</a> which allows you to save a lot if you already have a 3D TV or DLP-Link projector with corresponding glasses.  PALMEXX also makes DLP-Link glasses, and they cost a bit less than glasses for radio dialing, but for myself I chose radio glasses, because, unlike DLP-Link, 3D Vision glasses always correctly display angles, and with DLP-Link it happens 50 \ 50 that in general is not scary, because in all programs there is an opportunity to quickly change the camera angles in places, but it is so easy to use. <br><br>  Ps.  Here is such a ‚Äúreview‚Äù \ ‚Äústream of consciousness‚Äù, forgive me, the copywriter from me is crap, but many 3D techniques have been passing a lot through my hands lately, so I decided to share my experience, because I have something to compare, not stupid admiring new technologies, provoking people to buy unnecessary junk ... If it is interesting, I can still write how to play 3D on the Radeon, how to watch a movie on the ceiling and not wring the neck, how to shoot / render and edit stereoscopic material.  In general, since the writing of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/96467/">this post</a> , this whole 3D topic, for me went far beyond the limits of hobbies and experiments, into serious scientific work, so I don‚Äôt even know how to proceed, everything worked, everything worked out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Russia3D">(even some videos in tyrnet began to spread)</a> , but too much to write about. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/320/8e9/d3c/3208e9d3cf4481677b430045123b090e.png"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126660/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126660/</a></p>
