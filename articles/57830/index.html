  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Futurology Internet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Probably, there are different criteria by which it is possible to single out the stages of the evolution of the Internet.  For example, by the nature of user participation in content production (which was used in the ideology of Web 2.0).  Here I want to simulate the development of a network by the criterion of (logical) connectivity of its aggregate content, i.e.  to what extent is it a coherent whole.  It seems to me that this approach allows us to better understand the patterns of development, including the changing nature of user participation. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The average state shows the level achieved so far, while individual things, already implemented in some form (even in the form of non-network projects), show the future of the network.  The average level is currently characterized by a stage. <br><br>  1. - unsystematic unordered <b>data storage</b> .  Finding information in such a repository is time consuming and it becomes the primary function, because  without the availability of the necessary information it is impossible to operate with it, no further processes are possible.  Apparently, this is the reason for the dominant role of search engines in the modern Internet.  The obvious next step is

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      2. - in a certain way ordered data storage - some kind <b>of database</b> .  It greatly simplifies not only search, but also other important functions, for example, organizing information flows, generally organizing network resources of various kinds, identifying the maximum amount of relevant audience. <br><br>  Although the average level is still at stage 1, there is a gradual movement to stage 2. The massive transition of users from passive consumerism to active participation in content production (Web 2.0) rather enhances stage 1, which contributes to the transformation of the first into the second.  The fathers of the Internet have come up with a semantic web with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmetadata, which, if fully implemented, would mean a transition to stage 2 (at least in some form).  However, so far I have not heard the voiced idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe active participation of the masses of users in the production of metadata.  Not that the idea itself is unique;  rather, it is a problem of the format in which such user activity could effectively take place (I see a possible solution in the ‚Äú <a href="http://vrus.habrahabr.ru/blog/56309/">objects + connections</a> ‚Äù model).  Without this, the transition from 1 to 2 will be long and probably not complete, because, as I understand it, the concept of the Semantic Web does not intend to supply <i>any</i> data with metadata.  I propose to consider this last condition as a criterion by which the degree of realization of the next, third stage can be assessed, when <br><br>  3. content + metacontent = <b>knowledge base</b> , first as a tool more people-oriented, and then in understanding, close to modern expert systems, where logical inference machines operate with such bases.  The problem is that expert systems today are effective only in highly specialized areas;  expanding the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtheir effectiveness to something as universal as the world knowledge base about everything seems to be a criterion for the transition to the stage <br><br>  4. - The Internet as an <b>artificial intelligence</b> , which, although it cannot take on the most creative functions of people, will nevertheless become a powerful tool for the development of human civilization.  And what is development?  - this is the disclosure of the internal potential of individuals and society as a whole.  Then at first we will have a ‚Äúimmaculate circle‚Äù - the Internet will help accelerate the disclosure of human potential, and the latter, in turn, will improve the quality of artificial intelligence.  At this fourth stage, a symbiosis of people and machines is formed, a kind of ‚Äúmatrix‚Äù :) But if we accept the esoteric doctrines that the potential of man and society is so great that it far exceeds the capabilities of artificial intelligence, even worldwide, then the final result will be <br><br>  5. - the departure of people to the ‚Äú <b>parallel worlds</b> ‚Äù, to the ‚Äúother Internet‚Äù, the entry of humanity into the ‚Äúenergy-information fields of the universe‚Äù and so on :) And the Internet that has been discussed so far will cease to exist as a product that fulfills its role human activity ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57830/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57830/</a></p>
