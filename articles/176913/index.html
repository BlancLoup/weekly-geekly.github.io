Immediately, I note that the law has not yet been passed, and there is still a long way to go.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. Starting next year, the Green Card Lottery will be canceled.  Immigration for brothers, sisters, moms and dads of people with US citizenship will also be canceled. <br><br>  It seems to me that this situation can quite complicate the lives of some Russian immigrants in the United States.  It is now possible to queue up their parents or siblings on the green card.  If the law is adopted in this form, it will be impossible. <br><br>  2. The annual Green Card limit for holders of a doctoral degree (meaning PhD, that is, our candidate) in the field of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) will be canceled. <br><br>  The vitality of this situation gives me some doubts.  For example, in Russia there are quite a lot of candidates either fake or have no novelty.  At the same time in the US to get a PhD is much more difficult. <br><br>  3. 40 percent of the annual quota for employment-based visas (I understand green card) will be given to those holders of master degrees whose skills are sought by American employers (a very vague definition), as well as people with a master's degree at STEM from US universities. <br><br>  4. A visa will be created for startups. <br><br>  5. Like Canada, a point-based immigration system will be created.  Visas for it will be issued from October 2014 only for those people who work in the United States and have been in the queue for a green card for more than 3 years (in the case of Russia, they are bachelor students).  5 years after the adoption of the law, any person can apply for such a visa. <br><br>  This is a very interesting amendment that will allow immigration not only to people with technical skills. <br><br>  6. The annual limit for H1b visas (temporary workers) will be raised 2 times - up to 110 thousand.  The quota for people with a master's degree or higher from a US university will rise to 25 thousand.  The quota will increase depending on market demands.  Employers with more than 75% of foreign workers will not be able to hire others from the beginning of the fiscal year 2014. This threshold will decrease to 65% in 2015 and 50% in 2016. All companies with more than 50% of foreigners will pay more than 15 thousand dollars for each new employee . <br><br>  This is a very good amendment to the existing law.  If someone does not know that this year a lottery is being held on H1b visas.  People who lose it will lose their job.  The reason is that 75 percent of all visas are received by consulting companies from India.  Often, they simply do not use these visas, and if they use it, they bring workers who work for low wages to the USA.  They force out the Americans, take even more projects to their homes.  And most importantly, they do not give people who want to work for American corporations to get this visa. <br><br>  7. Spouses of H1b owners will be allowed to work.  Provided that the employee country does the same to US employees. <br><br>  Now the spouses of workers can only learn. <br><br>  8. Student visas for bachelors and above will do dual intent. <br><br>  This is also a very reasonable requirement.  Now, when you get a visa, you need to prove that you have no immigration intentions.  There are people who work for OPT (this is a program that allows you to work for several years after graduation) who cannot go home due to fear that they will be denied a visa and they will lose their jobs.  After all, to prove the absence of immigration intentions, when you have everything in the US is quite difficult. <br><br>  This is only a draft version of the law (he is rumored to consist of 1,500 pages).  He still has a lot to go through.  First the Senate, then the House of Representatives.  In both places a lot of amendments will be adopted.  If both of them (the Senate and the Chamber) come together in a single opinion (they are currently controlled by different factions), then he will go to the President for signing. <br><br>  In any case, there are a lot of good ideas in the law that, if adopted, I can probably correct the worst immigration system in the world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176913/">https://habr.com/ru/post/176913/</a></p>
