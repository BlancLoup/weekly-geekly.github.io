Usually, by saying ‚Äúnetbook‚Äù, we mean a straightforward ‚ÄúAtomic‚Äù platform, and choosing a ‚Äúnovelty‚Äù we focus primarily on external, design changes, most often boiling down to a banal color change. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/37b/2c4/a87/37b2c4a8737dc6b7eabf0cc55cfba3cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The more interesting is today's review, because in our hands (and you have the photo), the ASUS Eee PC 1215B model based on the AMD Fusion processor is a new stage in the development of portable 12-inch computers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The packaging of the ASUS Eee PC 1215B is made in a ‚Äúgreen style‚Äù - plain cardboard (one can even say eco-friendly cardboard) of sand color suitable for easy recycling.

      The contents of a complete netbook are as follows: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Netbook <br>  ‚Ä¢ Battery <br>  ‚Ä¢ Power supply + power cord <br>  ‚Ä¢ User's manual <br><br>  The closest thing to the new product is ASUS Eee PC 1215N on Atom and NVIDIA ION 2. Externally, the models are similar and designed in the company's corporate style - Seashell (sea shell). <br><br>  The netbook is preinstalled with Windows 7 Home Premium.  There are no disks for restoring the operating system, which is natural in the absence of a drive.  On the hard disk there is a hidden partition familiar to netbook owners, on which there is a copy of the entire software environment. <br><br>  The second system in the ASUS Eee PC 1215B is ExpressGate, a Linux-based software shell located on the flash memory in the motherboard.  Having made only one look at the device, we can say that the Eee PC 1215B is no different from its predecessors.  However, "inside" we are waiting for serious changes. <br><br>  <b>Specifications ASUS Eee PC 1215B</b> <br>  Processor: AMD Fusion C50 1.0GHz (dual core) / C30, E350 (dual core) <br>  Graphics subsystem: AMD Radeon HD 6250 / ATI Radeon HD 6310M <br>  RAM: 2048Mb, DDR3, 2 x SO-DIMM, 2GB <br>  Data Storage: 2.5 "SATA 320GB / 2.5" SATA 250 GB / 2.5 "SATA 500 GB <br>  Operating system: Windows 7 Home Premium <br>  Display: 12.1 "LED Backlight WXGA (1366x768) <br>  Connectors: 1 x VGA Connector <br>  3 x USB 2.0 <br>  1 x USB 3.0 (optional) <br>  1 x LAN RJ-45 <br>  1 x HDMI <br>  2 x Audio Jack (Headphone / Mic-In) <br>  1 x Card Reader: SD / SDHC / SDXC / MMC <br>  Wireless interfaces: Bluetooth 3.0, 802.11n <br>  Camera: 0.3Mp <br>  Battery: Li-Ion (6 cells), battery life 8 hours <br>  Dimensions: 296 x 203 x 38 mm <br>  Weight: 1.53 kg (with battery) <br><br>  The configuration of the netbook may vary depending on the configuration.  Our device is not the most powerful AMD Fusion C50 processor (1GHz) (it is inferior to AMD Fusion E350 1.6GHz), 2 GB of memory, 320 GB hard disk (250/500 in other variants) and no USB 3.0.  When choosing a netbook, carefully look at its characteristics. <br><br><h4>  Performance </h4><br>  <b>CPU</b> <br>  The new family of AMD Fusion - dual-core processors, which are combined with a memory controller and integrated graphics core.  In our review we are talking about the C-50 processor with a frequency of 1 GHz, with which the AMD Radeon HD 6250 chip is located. The L2 cache size is 512 KB. <br>  The processor is a typical netbook version, the representative of the younger series in the new family.  Tests of the Brazos platform show that the platform copes better with graphics than purely processor computing, but the netbook is well suited for ‚Äúoffice‚Äù work and web surfing.  The maximum total power consumption is only 9 W, you can not worry about the battery life. <br><br><img src="http://img847.imageshack.us/img847/1444/83179432.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img508.imageshack.us/img508/728/48693074.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/4612/47803238.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/2917/95614914.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img534.imageshack.us/img534/8763/83240441.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Synthetic tests of the processor showed the following results: <br>  Super Pi (1M) - 73.65 <br>  Super Pi (2M) - 176.171 <br>  3D Mark 06 (CPU) - 650 <br><br>  Processor performance is close to the capabilities of the competitive offer Intel Atom N550.  However, AMD has a noble trump card - integrated video. <br><br>  <b>Video subsystem</b> <br>  The core of the graphics chip is made on 40-nm tech standard and has 80 streaming conveyors.  The frequency of the chip is 280 MHz.  Radeon 6250 supports DX11, although there is no special need for this.  On the netbook will not go the latest gaming news.  Owners have one and a half times more powerful ATI Radeon HD 6310M video adapter to play more chances. <br><br><img src="http://img685.imageshack.us/img685/8152/24464446.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>HD video playback</b> <br><br><img src="http://img15.imageshack.us/img15/80/79742681.png" alt="image"><br><br>  1080p high quality video is a serious test for the system <br>  To check the playback of HD content, two video files were selected, one in 720p resolution, the other 1080p.  720p video plays without problems, but 1080p video on the netbook itself slows down a bit.  For this quality, the HDMI connector is designed - on a blue-ray TV connected to a netbook, the movie shows without any delay. <br><br>  Testing we carried out through KMPlayer.  However, not all players correctly support hardware acceleration of high-definition video of the new platform.  You can see from the screenshot that hardware video processing is not in progress, and the CPU load reaches 100%.  Therefore, if you have a desire to reproduce 20-30 gigovy rips 1920x1080x50p on the screen of a netbook, you can use Daum PotPlayer, developed by the same team as KMPlayer <br><br>  We had some minor problems with the drivers, but the installation of official drivers from the AMD site helped. <br><br><img src="http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/4999/111jeb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>HDD</b> <br>  The drive is set to a standard format of 2.5 ", its capacity is 320 GB. It does not make noise and does not heat up, but let's see what it can do when working. <br><br><img src="http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/7098/79506092.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/8665/45177439.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/3297/64408708.png" alt="image"><br><br>  According to the test results (and noiseless operation), a number of indicators are better than those of ASUS 1015PEM, 1018P, 1201N. <br><br>  <b>RAM</b> <br>  The laptop has 2048MB DDR3 memory.  The maximum supported volume is 4GB (2 strips of 2GB each).  Enthusiasts managed to establish 8 GB using the method of violence against equipment, but only out of sports interest - there is no practical need for so much memory. <br><br><img src="http://img402.imageshack.us/img402/7194/86862315.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The result of testing the laptop built-in assessment system Windows 7 was such a table. <br><br><img src="http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/1719/86989173.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The weakest point is expected - processor <br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  <b>Housing</b> <br><img src="http://img688.imageshack.us/img688/605/22222lvj.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img688.imageshack.us/img688/967/3333ik.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img64.imageshack.us/img64/3066/4444xw.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img585.imageshack.us/img585/9791/5555m.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The design and design of the netbook is no different from other representatives of the Seashell series - smooth lines, streamlined corners.  The laptop case is made of soft-touch dark matte plastic.  Unfortunately, not without gloss.  The frame around the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãblack and glossy, like a magnet, luring fingerprints and dust. <br><br>  Netbook cover is durable, resists pushing and clearly designed for a long stay on the road. <br><br><img src="http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/4140/57018050.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Build quality at the level, nothing creaks, not pressed (and does not fall off).  There is no battery play. <br><br><img src="http://img263.imageshack.us/img263/3949/777lk.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Keyboard type - insular, sufficient depth of travel and good return.  The size of the keys is almost the same as on 15 ‚Äùlaptops.  Typing is convenient and easy. <br><br><img src="http://img217.imageshack.us/img217/2074/76016398.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Switch \ switch of a mode of operation of a beech and switch \ of a wireless network <br><br><img src="http://img148.imageshack.us/img148/6906/63405961.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Beech Button <br><br><img src="http://img829.imageshack.us/img829/5233/82502342.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The touchpad in the same matte plastic as the entire front panel.  There are no irregularities on it, the analog of the mouse buttons is implemented in a single metal plate. <br><br><img src="http://img851.imageshack.us/img851/2321/29629041.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img684.imageshack.us/img684/3751/96170338.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Almost all indicators are on the front panel.  They are not very bright, and are located so as not to interfere when working at night. <br><br><img src="http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/8034/37675324.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The webcam is equipped with a protective curtain - a trifle, but nice <br>  The speakers are hidden in the bottom of the case, closer to the front edge.
