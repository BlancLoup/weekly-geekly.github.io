  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Diploma Tips Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  During my life I had to defend two diplomas and a large pile of coursework and various reports.  Well, from personal experience, I made several conclusions that I want to share with you.  We will talk about theses, which are the completion of studies in higher education.  But it seems to me that these tips will be useful in other cases. <br><br>  So, cum.  This is not a dissertation, but not a course one.  From the graduate is required to demonstrate the knowledge and skills that prove his qualifications of a person with higher education.  Accordingly, in this process there are two stages: the writing of the diploma and the protection of the diploma. <br><br>  Someone can express the idea that the main thing is to write a diploma, and the defense is nonsense.  I think it is not.  Whatever a good diploma is, this is generally not enough ... Although one mathematics teacher defended his diploma by formulating and proving a theorem.  He came to the defense with one A4 sheet, wrote the theorem on the blackboard with chalk, gave a sheet of evidence to the commission and said orally what this theorem is interesting for the mathematical world.  After 5-7 minutes, he came out with an ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù rating.

      But in most cases, a diploma is not so brilliant.  This is usually a repetition of already well-known theses, but with different figures, various calculations and projects.  It is very difficult to find a topic that would not have been written to you.  Therefore, do not neglect the process of protection - this is an opportunity to make an excellent diploma from a satisfactory diploma :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, enough of the reasoning.  Stage one: writing a diploma.  According to me, the supervisor must be either "shamming" or "authoritative."  If he understands the topic - then his advice will help you to write a diploma, and if he is authoritative in a circle of colleagues - then he is invaluable in defense.  From personal experience, you can write a diploma in a week.  Another week is required for the coordination of any bureaucratic issues - reviews, reviews, binding, etc.  But it is better to write a diploma in advance.  Although everyone says so.  But in practice, everything is done on the last day. <br><br>  What should be the structure of the diploma? <br><ul><li>  Title page </li><li>  Table of contents </li><li>  Introduction </li><li>  The first part, as well as the second, third and as much - as needed </li><li>  Conclusion </li><li>  Bibliography </li><li>  Various applications </li></ul><br><br>  Guess who reads all your 50-100 pages of research paper?  You yourself.  Well, the supervisor, if he is not lazy.  Everything.  No one else is interested in your diploma.  And what does the commission read?  She, too, looks at your diploma.  And she looks at the title page, table of contents, list of references, well, and briefly runs through the introduction, conclusion and conclusions of the chapters.  Sometimes it can look at pictures and graphics in the text and applications.  In general, she is more interested in a delicious table and drinks.  Yes, and home quickly dump from these graduates. <br><br>  Therefore, in your diploma, regardless of the university and specialty, the following sections should be especially well written: <br><br><h5>  Introduction </h5><br>  The most difficult part.  It is necessary to describe how important your work is for science and society (importance, relevance) and corresponds to your specialty (it makes no sense for an economist to write about programming).  Do not forget to specify objects, objects, goals, methods, tasks and other buzz words.  At the very end of the introduction, you need to tell about your work and its structure: what questions are explored in each chapter, how the chapters are interconnected. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  No less difficult part.  It should contain the fact that all promises in the introduction (goals, tasks) are fulfilled, describe the results, emphasize the relevance once more and rephrase the conclusions by chapters, if that makes sense. <br>  It would also be very desirable to provide ways to use the results of work in practice and indicate directions for further development (candidate or practical application).  In a word, look into the future and fantasize :) <br><br><h5>  Chapters, text of the diploma </h5><br>  Everything should be designed in accordance with the standards: fonts, spacing, captions for pictures, graphics, schemes.  No grammatical errors.  Each chapter of the work may have its own introduction and what is desirable are brief conclusions with the transition to the next chapter.  Work must be united, integral, connected.  Each part must follow one another. <br><br>  The list of references should not be outdated books.  It is acceptable to describe the websites, newspapers and magazines that were used. <br><br>  You see, this is what is required of a diploma for excellent protection.  We assume that the diploma is written. <br><br>  In view of the fact that a lot of text has come out, I will tell the most interesting part in the next part, devoted to the actual preparation for defense and defense. <br><br>  PS While the second part is not written - questions and comments are welcome :) <br><br>  This article is also published <a href="http://next2nothing.ru/blog/sovety-po-zashchite-diploma-chast-1">on my blog.</a> <br><br>  UPD: Hurry up and quickly wrote the <a href="http://sir-jack.habrahabr.ru/blog/62572/">second part</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62565/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62565/</a></p>
