  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Typography: font selection process</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One of the most valuable skills a designer can master is the ability to select fonts.  This results from the fact that the text is one of the main ways of communication of the designer with the user.  Typography is crucial for design. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/88c/a22/20a/88ca2220a69148fb9778a39b4a2eaf83.png"></div><br>  Typography is a complex and beautiful thing.  Some devote their entire career to working with her.  Fortunately for us, they describe their experience in detail, so our services have a whole bunch of online resources on typography. <br><br>  This article was intended as a small introduction for those who want to learn how to select fonts for design.  It will push you to expand the set of fonts and their combinations that you use in your layouts, not limited to familiar options. <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Define your goal </h4><br>  First of all, determine the goal that your design pursues.  What information do you want to convey?  What format? 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
      In good designs, typography fits the goal.  This is important because it is the fonts that help create a certain mood, set the tone and style of design. <br><br>  If you make, say, a greeting card with a large number of illustrations, choose a font that will be combined with the style in which they are made.  The font should be in harmony with the rest of the design. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/439/954/e59/439954e59d164189a1b664d16d1c13bd.jpeg"></div><br><br>  If you are designing a website with an emphasis on images, choose a simple font that will not distract the user's attention from them.  Use the font as a way to highlight the information you want to convey. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae7/fbf/eac/ae7fbfeaceec4fa9ae28a512892e25bd.png" width="600"></div><br><br><h4>  Outline your audience </h4><br>  Having decided on the purpose of design, decide for which audience you are doing it.  This step is of great importance, because information about users (age, interests, cultural background) can influence the decisions you make when choosing fonts. <br><br>  For example, some fonts are more suitable for younger people.  Children who are just learning to read need very legible fonts with sharp outlines of letters.  A good illustration of this is <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/sassoon/">Sassoon Primary</a> .  Sassoon Primary is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary_Sassoon">Rosemary Sassoon</a> project, which is based on its research on which fonts are easiest for children to read. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/231/a04/c5a/231a04c5a80f4d22b5a50afb136fe026.png"></div><br><br>  Other fonts are more appropriate for older people.  They are usually distinguished by the large size of the letters, pronounced contrast, the lack of prescription and decorative elements. <br><br>  When choosing a font, consider the features and needs of your target audience.  Simply put, put yourself in their place. <br><br><h4>  Look for inspiration </h4><br>  Look at the work of other designers.  Try to understand what motivated them by deciding to use these particular fonts. <br><br>  <b>Inspiration: Fonts</b> <br><br>  For fresh ideas on fonts, check out <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design-tips/best-free-fonts-for-designers-1233380">The 100 Best Free Fonts</a> from CreativeBloq - this is a great source that will give you the mood you want.  In their article, CreativeBloq explains the logic they followed when choosing each of the fonts. <br><br>  Another useful resource is the <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/100-greatest-free-fonts-collection-for-2015.html">100 Greatest Free Fonts Collection for 2015 from Awwwards</a> . <br><br>  In addition, Invision has created a <a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/free-typography-resources/%3Fimm_mid%3D0ef3cd%26cmp%3Dem-web-na-na-newsltr_20170322">huge repository</a> with resources for typography.  There you will find a lot of sources for inspiration. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b00/a66/c2f/b00a66c2fc6147cd938beb47dd8ac3dd.png"></div><br><br>  If you want to be inspired by the example of real web pages, I advise you to take a look at <a href="http://typ.io/">Typ.io.</a>  The site contains a collection of sources with interesting solutions from across the web.  In addition, for each sample, the site displays CSS font parameters below the text. <br><br>  In addition to specialized sites, you can visit your favorite pages and see what they use there.  Here, the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm%3Fhl%3Den">WhatTheFont</a> tool comes in handy - an extension for Chrome that displays font information when you move your mouse over text. <br><br>  <b>Inspiration: combinations</b> <br><br>  In addition to the fonts themselves, learn the different options for combining them - this is no less important.  The right combinations help form the visual hierarchy and make the design easier to read. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e85/826/211/e8582621171f40c79fdb92b43f4d62e5.png"></div><br><br>  The first source of inspiration to visit is <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/">Typewolf</a> .  On Typewolf collected examples of interesting combinations from different sites.  They also offer font guidelines and in-depth typography guides.  For those who work with fonts, this is a real treasure. <br><br>  <a href="http://fontpair.co/">FontPair</a> is another resource on how best to choose combinations designed specifically for working with <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> .  The resource provides the ability to sort by combinations of styles (for example, sans-serif and serif or serif and serif). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc3/94d/5c6/dc394d5c60914d8ab1e00fad30c939ba.png" width="600"></div><br><br>  And finally, the web is full of sets of ready-made combinations from professional designers.  Say <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/35768979/Typography-Google-Fonts-Combinations">Typography: Google Fonts Combinations</a> or <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/41054815/Typography-Google-Fonts-Combinations-Volume-2">Typography: Google Fonts Combinations Volume 2</a> .  Just type in the ‚Äúfont pairing‚Äù query on <a href="https://www.behance.net/">Behance</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/">Dribble</a> and other similar sites. <br><br><h4>  Choose a font </h4><br>  Now that you are theoretically savvy and stockpiled with inspiration, you can proceed to the selection.  In the selection process, remember the three principles: readability, intelligibility, goal. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/670/579/3cd/6705793cdc274323a98902b91825227b.png" width="600"></div><br><br>  Choose fonts that have a classic look and are easy to read.  Give up fancy fonts in favor of simple and practical.  And take into account the purpose of a font: some of them, for example, are more suitable for headings than for the main text. <br><br>  Accordingly, before choosing a font, consider the purpose for which you will use it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbc/13d/0ae/bbc13d0ae5d54da0867e79f5ee64c2a8.png" width="600"></div><br><br>  As for combinations of fonts, do not make them too complicated - limit yourself to three different types, no more.  In addition, select contrasting fonts.  This will help direct the user‚Äôs view: first to the heading, then to the main text.  You can also create a visual contrast using different sizes, colors and styles. <br><br>  For web fonts, you can use <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> , <a href="https://typekit.com/">Typekit</a> , and <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/">Font Squirrel</a> .  On Google Fonts everything is free, Typekit and Font Squirrel offer free and paid options. <br><br><h4>  Set size </h4><br>  Now that you have decided on the combination, the next step is to set the dimensions.  To do this, there is the excellent <a href="http://www.modularscale.com/">Modular Scale</a> tool by <a href="https://twitter.com/timbrown%3Flang%3Den">Tim Brown</a> , the main typography specialist at Adobe.  Modular Scale is a system that determines the ratios that, as history shows, is most pleasing to the eye, and builds a scale of text sizes based on these ratios. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/23a/a22/367/23aa223673b449c5b00bc7b59802de64.png"></div><br><br>  Suppose you choose a scale based on the golden section.  Here are the first five values ‚Äã‚Äãthat the system will calculate for you: <br><br>  Golden Ratio (1: 1.618) <br>  1,000 x 1,618 = 1,618 <br>  1.618 x 1.618 = 2.618 <br>  2.618 x 1.618 = 4.236 <br>  4.236 x 1.618 = 6.854 <br>  6.854 x 1.618 = 11.089 <br><br>  One of the problems you may encounter is that some correlations are too large.  See what happens if you continue with the scale based on the golden section: <br><br>  Golden Ratio (1: 1.618) <br>  ... <br>  11.089 x 1.618 = 17.942 <br>  17.942 x 1.618 = 29.03 <br>  29.030 x 1.618 = 46.971 <br>  46.971 x 1.618 = 75.999 <br>  75.999 x 1.618 = 122.966 <br><br>  As you can see, the difference between the values ‚Äã‚Äãbecomes too big.  Most interfaces require smaller intervals.  But it is not scary: a wide variety of scales is presented on the <a href="http://www.modularscale.com/">Modular Scale</a> - from geometry, nature, music. <br><br>  Minor Second 15:16 <br>  Major Second 8: 9 <br>  Minor Third 5: 6 <br>  Major Third 4: 5 <br>  ... <br><br>  Therefore, instead of the golden section, you can use a different ratio, which will give smaller intervals, for example, Perfect Fourth. <br><br>  Perfect Fourth (3: 4) <br>  ... <br>  9.969 x 1.333 = 13.288 <br>  13.288 x 1.333 = 17.713 <br>  17.713 x 1.333 = 23.612 <br>  23.612 x 1.333 = 31.475 <br>  31.475 x 1.333 = 41.956 <br>  41.956 x 1.333 = 55.927 <br><br>  By selecting a suitable scale, you can drag the sizes for different types of fonts from your list and round them to whole numbers. <br><br>  Font Sizes <br>  Header 1: 55px <br>  Header 2: 42px <br>  Header 3: 31px <br>  Header 4: 24px <br>  Header 5: 14px <br>  Body: 17px <br>  Caption: 14px <br><br>  The Modular Scale method involves calculating the font size with mathematical precision, but this is just a guideline.  Use it to get approximate dimensions, and then adjust them by eye. <br><br><h4>  Create a font style library </h4><br>  The last step remains: create a library of styles so that the fonts look identical in all layouts. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ad/ae9/84d/5adae984d6864f4b95dfb96f96bccb7e.png"></div><br><br>  In programs like <a href="http://sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a> , you can create generic text styles to quickly insert text with already specified parameters from the style sheet. <br><br>  It is at this stage that you should finally determine the colors, styles and sizes.  Speaking of colors: choose them with an eye on the overall palette.  Text colors should be harmoniously combined with it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe4/2e0/811/fe42e081107e4bfabe79595c4a17d1b1.png"></div><br><br>  Be sure to include the following in your style library: font types, colors, sizes, and patterns.  <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/style/typography.html">Google's style sheet Material Design typography</a> is a good example of how to compose it.  You can also use <a href="https://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns/typography">Mailchimp</a> , <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/typography/">Apple</a> , and <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2909744-UI-Kit">Focus Labs</a> style libraries as manuals. <br><br>  Typography is an area of ‚Äã‚Äãexperimentation, art and science in one bottle.  I urge you to step out of your comfort zone and actively explore all the possibilities. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/327062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/327062/</a></p>
