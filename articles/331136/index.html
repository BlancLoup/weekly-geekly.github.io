I find the answer to the question considering the UI and UX, new terms in the field of web design</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Been thinking about the essence of design.  And gradually over a long period of time, I had an opinion that later, when studying the materials for writing an article, I received confirmation from experts who know about design firsthand.  But first things first. <br><br>  It is more convenient for me to start a conversation on this topic with a discussion of the situation in web design terminology.  That it was the motive to write. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f76/525/73a/f7652573ad1c4f91abbf338150bb00f6.jpg"><br>  <font color="#cc0000"><i>Mario Botta.</i></font>  <font color="#cc0000"><i>Church of sv.</i></font>  <font color="#cc0000"><i>John the Baptist in Monio.</i></font>  <font color="#cc0000"><i>Switzerland.</i></font>  <font color="#cc0000"><i>1986-1998</i></font> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The field of web design, which has been actively developing in the last 10 years, quickly passed through a stage of chaotic creativity, and about five years ago its maturity was marked by the emergence of two ‚Äúnew‚Äù terms, <abbr title="User Interface (literally &quot;user interface&quot;)">UI</abbr> and <abbr title="User Experience (literally: &quot;user experience&quot;)">UX</abbr> designs.  I derive the figure of five years from the following fact.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD">The Wikipedia article "Web Design"</a> in the "literature" column contains the most recent book with a web theme dated 2012.  And the terms <abbr title="User Interface (literally &quot;user interface&quot;)">UI</abbr> and <abbr title="User Experience (literally: &quot;user experience&quot;)">UX</abbr> are still missing there.  I have quoted the ‚Äúnew ones‚Äù because the phenomena described by these terms are nothing new.  The same trends are present in other areas of design, but domestic people often do not want, and Western, due to the inferiority of the Bologna education system and can not know more, and therefore again and again invent another bicycle.  In a word, the terms are presented as something fundamentally fresh and never appeared before.  However, this is true, the terms are really fresh, but the phenomena described by them are old as the world.

      <font color="#ffffff">Space before new section</font> <br><h2>  <font color="#ff7e17">Ui</font> </h2><br>  <abbr title="User Interface (literally &quot;user interface&quot;)"><font color="#473424"><b>The UI</b></font></abbr> is the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe external visible, perceptible, artistic design of any objects.  In other words, UI designers are good old graphic designers or decorators. <br><br>  <a href="https://blog.adn.agency/chem-otlichaetsya-ux-dizajner-i-ui-dizajner/">One of the experts</a> on the ADN company blog described the role of the UI designer. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#">"</font> <font color="#473424"><abbr title="User Interface (literally &quot;user interface&quot;)"><b>UI</b></abbr></font> <font color="#">-user interface is an interface designer in an ideal environment that draws buttons, icons, forms, selects fonts and makes a harmonious and beautiful layout from everything. A site, an application, even what the user will interact with - even though the screen station terminal. And does not think about anything else. "</font> </blockquote><br>  What can I say, the title of <abbr title="User Interface (literally &quot;user interface&quot;)">UI-</abbr> designer sounds much more solid, more presentable and sonorous than a graphic artist, associated by many with a modest, unpretentious unlucky under-training, who could not become a full-fledged artist and therefore had to earn a living secondary bread craft.  The decorator doesn't sound much better. <br><br><pre><code class="javascript hljs">,     ,       .</code> </pre> <br><h3>  <font color="#ffae6c">Where does UI come from and why?</font> </h3><br>  And where did the need for the emergence of such a term <abbr title="User Interface (literally &quot;user interface&quot;)">UI</abbr> ?  The term appeared in the West, and there for a very long time there has been a tendency to train narrow specialists.  Perhaps there are also reasons given below. <br><br>  As for the Native side, in Soviet times artists began to call CPU graduates (artistic vocational schools), which immediately sharply dropped the term‚Äôs rating, which became associated with professional rather than higher education.  In 2004, Viktor Shudegov, then chairman of the Senate Committee on Science, Culture, Education, Health, and Environment, even called the PTU system a social settling facility at the parliamentary hearings on the development of education. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe division of the domestic education system into an elite and mass one is becoming more tangible, which leads to a violation of the principle of the general availability of quality education.  ‚ÄúSchools and vocational schools are turning into a social settler!‚Äù <a href="http://www.solidarnost.org/thems/obshestvo/obshestvo_1364.html">Shudegov concluded</a> . ‚Äù <br><br>  Comments as they say are superfluous.  Few people want to feel part of the sediment of the social clarifier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d15/1f4/5f4/d151f45f4cd846e99b07aa3168f409ed.jpg"><br>  <font color="#cc0000"><i>Artist, master (MGHPTK) Tatiana Vladimirovna Budeiko (second from right) with her students.</i></font> <br><br><blockquote>  I can‚Äôt agree with the chairman of the Senate Committee, because I finished HPU No. 42 in Yekaterinburg before I entered the university, and I don‚Äôt regret it much.  It was interesting, new knowledge, acquaintance with extraordinary personalities, with many of whom I studied later in the Academy. </blockquote><br>  Decorating is perceived by many as something extremely traditional, ancient, stretching from somewhere in antiquity and, as a result, not fashionable, unclaimed or creative.  And also narrowly specialized.  In other words, decorators, we can only decorate walls with ornaments, where they are to designers, or so many think so. <br><br>  But in reality, a huge number of those who entered the design field are sure that the majority (especially girls) during their studies show the greatest interest in the artistic part of the knowledge taught, and they are easier for them.  And as a result, in the future they can very beautifully visualize their ideas, but in the process of developing a project they pay the least attention to the engineering part, considering it to be not their business.  Which, of course, is both sad and ridiculous, first of all for those who then painfully try to bring the fruits of their work to life.  And strongly swears at the same time. <br><br>  This situation makes it obvious that such specialists are inferior, but their diplomas say that they are designers and they would not agree to rename them to any decorators, or, moreover, artists-designers.  Yes, and they certainly have a place in the labor market.  Because some of the graduates of the design departments (about salvation) prefer to be engaged in engineering surveys, or besides them there is simply no one at the enterprise to do and all such work falls on their shoulders, and the girls will cope with beautiful pictures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4ba/972/d45/4ba972d4571b4afca3b265fa5c7259de.jpg"><br>  <font color="#cc0000"><i>Beautiful pictures and girl UI designer.</i></font> <br><br>  Therefore, for Russian designers, the emergence of a new term, which, on the one hand, transforms the embarrassment of professional inferiority of university graduates and courses into the concept of specialization, is very welcome.  On the other hand, it once again makes obvious the dual nature of a full-fledged design with a capital letter. <br><br>  <font color="#ffffff">Space before new section</font> <br><h2>  <font color="#ff7e17">Ux</font> </h2><br>  <abbr title="User Experience (literally: &quot;user experience&quot;)">UX</abbr> really always write with a capital letter.  What is it? <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/321312/">A treatment from Alexey Segodin</a> from the Habrahabr block.  Aleksey Segodin ( <a href="https://habr.com/users/aleksei_segodin/" class="user_link">Aleksei_Segodin</a> ) art director and designer (very) of a wide profile. <br><br><blockquote>  " <b><font color="#473424"><abbr title="User Experience (literally: &quot;user experience&quot;)"><b>UX</b></abbr></font></b> is a <b><font color="#473424">User Experience</font></b> (literally:" user experience "). That is, this is what experience / impression a user gets from working with your interface. Is he able to achieve the goal and how easy or difficult is it to do." </blockquote><br>  Recently, I looked into the Great Soviet Encyclopedia.  Just to clarify for himself the above mentioned question and found that the <abbr title="User Experience (literally: &quot;user experience&quot;)">UX</abbr> appeared along with the beginning of the professional development of other branches of design on the second wave of the scientific and technological revolution, and it turns out that in 2017 the new-fashioned <abbr title="User Experience (literally: &quot;user experience&quot;)">UX</abbr> is already 77 years old! <br>  Surprisingly symbolic.  77 is a number symbolizing the infinite mercy of God and human. <br><br>  So in the article <a href="http://bse.sci-lib.com/article054686.html">"Engineering Psychology"</a> I found the very description and the very goals and tasks that UX now solves. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Article TSB "Engineering Psychology"</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Engineering psychology, one of the special disciplines of psychology.  Engineering psychology solves the following tasks: <br><br>  1) the rational organization of the activities of people in the "man and machine" systems designed to control and process information; <br><br>  2) appropriate distribution of functions between the manager and service personnel and technical means of automation; <br><br>  3) optimization of information support and decision-making processes.  In solving these problems, engineering psychology is based on data from related sciences, such as personality psychology, labor psychology, etc., and also works closely with systems engineering and engineering disciplines. <br><br>  Engineering psychology originated in the 40s.  20 in.  and originally developed as a direction of traditional labor psychology, the main object of which was the study of direct human interaction with objects and tools (tools, machine tools, conveyors, means of transport, etc.).  Tasks Engineering psychology was mainly limited to a critical analysis of equipment design errors or operator training and the identification of factors affecting the effectiveness of the ‚Äúman and machine‚Äù systems.  Useful recommendations were developed on the rational design of control panels, instrument scales, display devices, etc. Formation Engineering psychology as an independent scientific psychological discipline was due to the automation of production and the development of remote control and management tools.  In the 50s.  In general, the laws of reception and processing of information were determined by man, and in the 60s.  - General principles of the organization of human interaction and computer.  The recommendations developed have found practical application in the automation of control processes in production, aviation, astronautics, etc. At the end of the 60s.  Engineering psychology turned to the synthesis, design of human activity in large systems, it makes a certain contribution to the development of measures to improve the efficiency of their functioning. <br><br>  The task of rational organization of people‚Äôs activities in the ‚Äúman and machine‚Äù systems includes an analysis of the structure of the team and its coordination with the chosen management structure.  This takes into account the mediated nature of communication and communication between team members and provides for such a distribution of functional responsibilities that would best meet the goal.  An important problem is the rational distribution of responsibility for the decisions made and coordination of the interests of each member of the team.  For the successful activity of small groups (aircraft crews, personnel of command and control centers, etc.), it is necessary to identify the criteria of psychological compatibility of group members, which is very important when recruiting them.  Psychological compatibility is the most important condition for the preservation of a healthy team, especially isolated for a long time from the usual environment. <br><br>  In the distribution of functions in the ‚Äúman and machine‚Äù system, it is assumed that the solution of creative tasks related to the logical analysis of the situation, assessment and forecast of its changes should be carried out by man;  the machine is charged with performing routine, repetitive operations, mainly combinatorial and computational in nature, as well as storing, processing and promptly issuing large amounts of information.  The electronic computer should be considered as a qualified assistant and interlocutor, contributing to the strengthening of the creative thinking and intuition of the person. <br><br>  Optimization of information support and decision-making processes requires organizing selective control of information sources at control points and boils down to choosing the best characteristics of an information model: the degree of generalization (detail) of information displayed on display devices;  volume and rate of its update;  coding methods that provide unambiguous perception and storage of information.  The basic principle of organizing information preparation for decision-making is that, at the request of the computer operator, it can perform all the time-consuming and auxiliary transformations of the available information and produce the results in the form most suitable for solving operational problems.  In automated systems, the operator is deprived of the possibility of direct influence on the controlled object (object of labor).  Under these conditions, a new task arose: not only coordinating the executive motor acts of a person with dynamic properties and characteristics of tools and means of production (this problem was solved by the methods of work psychology), but mainly the abilities of the operator to receive, process and transmit information with the information characteristics of the control object. <br><br>  The design of human activity is based on the fundamental research of higher mental functions of a person - perception, memory, thinking (figurative and conceptual), which are internal psychological tools and means of human activity.  These internal tools include experience, knowledge, programs, schemes and skills of the operator, which together comprise his professional appearance.  On the basis of internal means of activity, permanent and operational figurative-conceptual models are formed that determine the activity of the operator and the decision-making process.  The operator, using the arsenal of internal means of activity, relies on external means, which include information models implemented on information display devices or in the form of a document, computer algorithms, and other auxiliary means for preparing problem solving, controls and communication tools.  It can be said that the design of human activity consists in the coordination of internal and external means of activity, the design of coordinated conceptual and information models that fully use the psychological capabilities of the operator to receive and process information. <br><br>  Under various conditions, the center of gravity of this design may fall either on external or on internal means of activity.  There are a number of information models that can be conventionally called models-images of the real situation.  These include the display of the air situation on the radar screen, aerial photographs, pictures of the processes in the track cameras, etc. These models are determined by the available technical capabilities to collect primary information.  Engineering and psychological recommendations for working with such information models relate to the conditions of illumination, level of contrast, mode of operation, etc. The main task of psychologists in these cases is to analyze the activities and the formation of its internal resources.  There are other information models where the operator deals not with the primary, but with the previously processed information, for example, incoming to the display devices from the computer.  In these cases, the developers and specialists in engineering psychology have a lot of room for the technical implementation of various types of information models and the focus can be on creating adequate external means of the operator‚Äôs activities. <br><br>  The most important problems of engineering psychology include: the development of methods for professional selection, training and training of operators;  identification of the specifics of the operators in specific systems and the development of recommendations, norms and standards for taking into account the human factor in the creation and operation of production, military and organizational systems;  designing rational information models and controls;  formulation of requirements for computer algorithms and methods for solving problems by the operator;  development of methods for controlling the functional states of operators (fatigue, mental tension, stress);  the development of principles for the construction of camera stations in accordance with the requirements of technical aesthetics and artistic design. <br><br>  Developing as an applied scientific discipline, engineering psychology in the formulation of problems, methods of research and development uses the achievements of theoretical and experimental psychology and at the same time opens up new research problems for them.  At the present stage, for engineering psychology, the data obtained in the study of individual psychological personality traits, especially the emotional sphere, the sphere of needs and motives of activity, are especially important.  Identification of the actual psychological criteria and methods for studying the mechanisms of the operator‚Äôs activity is a necessary condition for solving engineering and psychological problems.  Organizations and individuals conducting research, advisory and educational activities in the field of engineering psychology, unite abroad into societies: ‚ÄúHuman factors and biotechnology‚Äù (USA), ‚ÄúErgonomics‚Äù (Great Britain, France and Japan), ‚ÄúAntropotechnology‚Äù (Germany).  In the USSR, engineering and psychological services are coordinated by the relevant sections of the Society of Psychologists of the USSR and the Scientific Council on the complex problem of Cybernetics under the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences.

After all, the range of issues raised, the used branches of knowledge in design design is much wider.  Here you can call and anatomy, and biochemistry and biomechanics of the human body.  They are in demand when forming a relationship between a design object and a person.  And then, after a person touched the object in question, picked it up or put it on himself, the two of them already enter into relationships with the outside world and this requires developers to have an additional knowledge of sociology, political science, economics, logic, logistics, materials science, resistance materials, etc. To which we can say that engineering as a field and the field of human knowledge is extremely broad and even reminds me of natural history, therefore it includes all of the above. <br><br>  But psychology is highlighted especially because with all the calculations, assumptions, investigations and justifications the designer always repels himself from the person‚Äôs personality, as if from a stove.  Human soulfulness and spirituality are the main landmarks. <br><br>  <font color="#ffffff">Space before new section</font> <br><h2>  <font color="#ff7e17">About design essence</font> </h2><br>  Well, figured out what is <abbr title="User Interface (literally &quot;user interface&quot;)">UI</abbr> in design and what is <abbr title="User Experience (literally: &quot;user experience&quot;)">UX</abbr> .
