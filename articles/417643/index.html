TV series</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Summer is a time of travel and well-deserved rest.  Whatever the journey and wherever you go, surely it will be a long road (flight or train), or a medium-quality connection, if we are talking about places far from the benefits of civilization. <br><br>  Usually thrifty people take a bunch of movies and TV shows with them on a trip so that they can stop their ears in transport and listen to the voices of their favorite characters. <br><br>  We have prepared for you a small selection of serials, one way or another connected with IT.  And the long-term friendship of <a href="https://www.lanit.ru/">LANIT</a> with the International Documentary Film Festival " <a href="https://www.midff.ru/">DOKER</a> " prompted us to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis post, where, by the way, including with our help, the nomination for the films about the possibilities of information technologies "Let IT Dok!" Became traditional.

But he would not be a billionaire if he did it for free.  The guys live in his house for free, but they owe him 10% of the profits of their start-ups. <br><br>  Of course, the plot revolves not only around the development of certain projects - the characters often get into everyday situations familiar to the common man, but come out of them like classic geeks. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ec/eff/318/2eceff318f10f3c4d2385ec16ea8ea32.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  <b>To watch</b> <br><br>  Anyone who likes start-ups about startups at the stage of inventing and making difficult choices - to sell or develop themselves.  Lovers of jokes about IT people who are bored with very stereotypical jokes about IT people.  Introverts who like to watch TV shows about introverts. <br><br>  <b>Who does not look</b> <br><br>  Anyone who believes that all the jokes about IT are obviously not smart.  Someone who hates non-formals and thinks that only big companies are always right, while others have no reason to pull something of their own.  Tired of the series, where the main characters - the company Nerdov with laptops. <br><br><h1>  Computer scientists (IT Crowd) </h1>  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0487831/%3Fref_%3Dnv_sr_6">Series on IMDB</a> / <a href="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/kompyutershchiki-2006-386715/">Series on Kinopoisk</a> <br><br>  Central London, a large corporation.  A basement full of rubbish.  Three people from the IT department for whom this basement is the abode.  These are the "computer scientists" who spend their time inventing all kinds of pranks with the help of the technologies available to them. <br><br>  While in their team does not appear a specialist in communications, which generally do not understand anything in computers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69f/53b/187/69f53b1879a972489c854ece2b7e4ded.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  <b>To watch</b> <br><br>  Lovers of old TV shows.  Those who are not angry offscreen laughter.  Those who did not get the joke about "turn off" and "turn on". <br><br>  <b>Who does not look</b> <br><br>  Haters offscreen laughter.  For the former supporters, who still have phantom pains and sleepless nights with phrases like "And here I pressed something and ...".  Those who strongly dislike banal jokes about IT people. <br><br><h1>  Stop and burn (Halt and Catch Fire) </h1>  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/%3Fref_%3Dfn_al_tt_1">Series on IMDB</a> / <a href="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/ostanovis-i-gori-2014-719481/">Series on Kinopoisk</a> <br><br>  <i>"Halt and Catch Fire (HCF mnemonic code) is a hypothetical assembler command that, when executed, the computer's central processor stops executing further commands, due to which it is necessary to perform a hard reset to restore functionality."</i> ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire">Wiki</a> ) <br><br>  80s.  Two guys in the garage are trying with the help of reverse engineering to create a brand new computer based on the IBM PC.  Only they want to make not another healthy desktop, but a portable (at that time) laptop. <br><br>  Intrigues, the bases, nervous breakdowns, corporate romp, the sluggishness of large companies.  The series well shows that not only the chips can be burned out, but also people. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aeb/907/b29/aeb907b296d7572dda0288147cf94611.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  <b>To watch</b> <br><br>  Fans watch the development of the startup and the founders of disputes.  Those who are seduced by the atmosphere of the 80s, when a lot of things we were used to just began <br><br>  <b>Who does not look</b> <br><br>  Those who are members of the club ‚ÄúHow I am enraged by the man who played Thranduil‚Äù.  Lee is essentially the main role here.  To those who love only accurate biographical dramas and always say: ‚ÄúYes, in fact, it was not like that‚Äù. <br><br><h1>  Mr. Robot </h1>  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/%3Fref_%3Dnv_sr_1">Series on IMDB</a> / <a href="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/mister-robot-2015-859908/">Series on Kinopoisk</a> <br><br>  The story of a young programmer who settled down to work in a global corporation in order to bring it down.  Elliot Anderton, a guy who wouldn‚Äôt indicate in the summary ‚ÄúCommunicability and Joy‚Äù, becomes a member of the hacker community with a rather anarchistic outlook on life. <br><br>  The series is good at least in that it more or less shows the tools of information security specialists.  That is, this is not the case when ‚Äúhacking‚Äù on the screen is performed under beautiful animated green wallpapers from the ‚ÄúMatrix‚Äù. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e4/c5f/033/2e4c5f033848fe21c083b4df1f74822e.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  <b>To watch</b> <br><br>  For those who love movies and TV shows about corporate conspiracies and as a result - civil conspiracies against corporations.  For those who are sick, that in the movie about hackers on the screen during hacking, there is always a wallpaper from ‚ÄúThe Matrix‚Äù or ‚Äúuploading evil rootkit.exe 97%‚Äù.  Here, at least a list of Linux teams makes sense.  And indeed Kali linux. <br><br>  <b>Who does not look</b> <br><br>  Tired of lonely and introverted heroes.  Those who are tired of serials in a monotonous grayish color. <br><br><h1>  World of the Wild West (Westworld) </h1>  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475784/%3Fref_%3Dnv_sr_1">Series on IMDB</a> / <a href="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/mir-dikogo-zapada-2016-195523/">Series on Kinopoisk</a> <br><br>  45 years ago (1973) Michael Crichton, known to lovers of fiction based on the novels The Andromed Strain and Jurassic Park, wrote the script and directed the film The Western World. <br><br>  The plot of the old film moves around a software crash in androids, which should in every way entertain visitors to the park. <br><br>  Around the same, the story of Jonathan Nolan (Christopher's brother) ‚ÄúThe World of the Wild West‚Äù is also developing. <br><br>  Can androids have their own mind and free will?  Do they dream of electricians or worse? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/627/d0b/629/627d0b629b76e049de10c734ede6acf6.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  <b>To watch</b> <br><br>  Lovers of films about androids and ethical aspects of their coexistence with man.  To fans of Anthony Hopkins.  Those who are sure that HBO will not remove the bad. <br><br>  <b>Who does not look</b> <br><br>  Those to whom everything from HBO is a waste of time.  Those who have the edge of a movie about androids and car uprisings are already full.  Those who do not want to look at it, because almost everyone is watching it now and generally they have got it with their westward, there is nothing new in it. <br><br><h1>  Black Mirror </h1>  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/%3Fref_%3Dnv_sr_2">Series on IMDB</a> / <a href="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/chernoe-zerkalo-2011-655800/">Series on Kinopoisk</a> <br><br>  The series shows the reverse side of the ubiquitous penetration of digital technology in our lives.  A dystopia that Aldous Huxley and George Orwell would surely like.  Each episode is a separate, independent episode unrelated to the others. <br><br>  The digital social rating of the individual, the power of Twitter over public opinion, cyber blackmail - all this is in the "Black Mirror".  And much more. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cfd/433/5d0/cfd4335d0e85681992bca82d9ea8378e.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  <b>To watch</b> <br><br>  Lovers tickle your nerves, thinking about the potential dangers of new technologies and general digitalization in general.  Those who are too lazy to follow the plot, smeared for the whole season.  There is one series - one story.  The episodes are not related. <br><br>  <b>Who does not look</b> <br><br>  Anyone who is sure that all such scarecrows are like an old neighbor next to Wi-Fi, because her milk is sour. <br><br><h1>  CSI: Cyberspace (CSI: Cyber) </h1>  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3560060/%3Fref_%3Dfn_al_tt_1">Series on IMDB</a> / <a href="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/csi-kiberprostranstvo-2015-840541/">Series on Kinopoisk</a> <br><br>  In principle, the CSI series themselves regularly supply memes like this to the Internet: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/467/d62/39b/467d6239be278434587aec9a2e13abbe.png"></div><br>  In the case of CSI Cyber, as the name suggests, criminals use high technology.  And the FBI special agent predicts the behavior of hackers, trying to predict their next moves. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c8/e87/6fd/4c8e876fdf1508715493d5765b728d89.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  <b>To watch</b> <br><br>  To the one who has not yet filled the laptop with tea after viewing previous CSI and the flow of technical information about the cases under investigation. <br><br>  <b>Who does not look</b> <br><br>  Someone who is very annoyed when heroes with pathos talk about the technical aspects of cybercrime, not always understanding the essence of the matter under discussion. <br><br><h1>  Startup (Startup) </h1>  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5028002/%3Fref_%3Dfn_al_tt_1">Series on IMDB</a> / <a href="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/startap-2016-972878/">Series on Kinopoisk</a> <br><br>  And again the FBI and brilliant programmers against cybercrime. <br><br>  A young banker who has invested dirty money in a programmer startup associated with cryptocurrencies.  FBI agent looking for a money trail.  Criminal elements, whose funds, in fact, invested in a startup. <br><br>  And all this starts to spin in a single plot. <br><br>  We recommend not only to fans of TV series about IT and finance, but also to fans of Martin Freeman (he plays the role of an FBI agent here) and Ron Perlman. <br><br>  The creators of the series - Crackle.  The guys are not the highest grossing and well-known, but they have already managed to make the serial version of the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5992164/%3Fref_%3Dnv_sr_2">Big Kush</a> (6.9 IMDB).  From the original Snatch there is only about a company of friends and a set of storylines. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d8/b4f/284/9d8b4f284a6dc73b56790e811c552ee0.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  <b>To watch</b> <br><br>  The one who normally treats the mat in the series (in the original it is enough, in the correct translation - more than).  Those who believe that the financial system may have a completely different future, thanks to new currencies and technologies.  Anyone who does not mind the excess scenes of sex on the screen. <br><br>  <b>Who does not look</b> <br><br>  To the one who did not leave immediately with the wildest speed, download the series after reading the paragraph above. <br><br><h1>  People (Humans) </h1> <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4122068/%3Fref_%3Dnv_sr_1">Series on IMDB</a> / <a href="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/lyudi-2015-855925/">Series on Kinopoisk</a> <br><br>  In the fictional world, people have robot services - androids, in their performance characteristics and appearance indistinguishable from an ordinary person.  "Synthetics" are as familiar as the presence of a dishwasher in the house.  And they can not only clean the dust, wash the dishes or take revenge on the yard, but also perform their marital duties quite well if the spouse has a headache. <br><br>  Androids are quite satisfied with this state of affairs (of course, they haven‚Äôt seen any other world), until one (or, more precisely, one) appears among them that is capable of rather deliberate acts, and not just the implementation of standard programs. <br><br>  The series shows what moral and social problems may arise in such a society. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/737/242/daa/737242daafa0fde1c29849c5f762b2b7.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  <b>To watch and not to watch</b> - here we would duplicate the categories of viewers of the Westworld described above.  Yes, serials are different, and this one, in general, is less epic and simpler.  But the audience of potentially interested is about the same. <br><br><h1>  Scorpion (Scorpion) </h1>  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3514324/">Series on IMDB</a> / <a href="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/skorpion-2014-826050/">Series on Kinopoisk</a> <br><br>  Walter O'Brien is a real-life IT entrepreneur from Ireland who created <a href="http://www.scorpioncomputerservices.com/index">Scorpion Computer Services</a> . <br><br>  A computer genius and a company of children begin to work for the US Department of Homeland Security in order to solve all the high-tech problems that no less advanced criminals put before society. <br><br>  In real life, Walter‚Äôs company, by the way, reports that it provides similar services. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn real life, Team Scorpion provides solutions for‚Äú ANY funded problem ‚Äú.  That's right;  available at $ 10K or more. ‚Äù <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc4/68f/322/cc468f322a39054fcff7439f6cc52906.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  <b>To watch</b> <br><br>  Fans of TV shows about IT of a general orientation, when all TV shows about computers are equally good. <br><br>  <b>Who does not look</b> <br><br>  If you got the series about how the team of supergens with IQ the size of a house copes with the problems.  If you do not really believe that you can connect to a flying plane from a laptop via Wi-Fi.  Or from the wing of the aircraft using a cable.  Those who are tired of saving the world in almost every series. <br><br><h1>  Artificial Intelligence (Intelligence) </h1>  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2693776/%3Fref_%3Dnv_sr_3">Series on IMDB</a> / <a href="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/iskusstvennyy-intellekt-2014-740776/">Series on Kinopoisk</a> <br><br>  USCYBERCOM ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A8%25D0%2590">Cybernetic Command of the USA</a> ) creates an ideal intelligence officer - a special services soldier who was successfully integrated into the brain with a supercomputer in the form factor of a small chip. <br><br>  After that, Gabriel (played by Josh Holloway, known to the viewer as Sawyer in LOST and a small run in Mission Impossible-4), begins not only to successfully crack nearby Wi-Fi within reach, but also to perform important government tasks.  Clearly, for the benefit of humanity and democracy. <br><br>  By Gabriel put a partner, who ensures that he was all right.  Well, who will watch the series, in which the main character does not have a partner. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d21/fda/b8f/d21fdab8fc7be318044d40970e17d6b7.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  <b>To watch</b> <br><br>  Josh fans.  Those who are interested in at least the basic (almost comic) branch of human development as a symbiote with a high-performance chip in the brain. <br><br>  <b>Who does not look</b> <br><br>  To those to whom the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa super soldier seems ridiculous, and a smart super soldier with a chip in the brain is even funnier.  Those who are a bit fed up with the fact that with the help of a successful connection to Wi-Fi you can do everything with everything. <br><br><hr><br>  As you can see, our selection consists only of foreign-made serials.  This is not to say that it came out on purpose - simply when searching for similar series and trying to remember everything that was viewed on its own, something domestic, noteworthy, was not found either in the depths of the memory or in the network.  If they do exist, and we missed something sensible - let us know in the comments. <br><br>  <i>PS</i> <br><br>  Given the huge number of TV shows (namely TV shows) about IT people and technology, we probably missed something important and perhaps worthy of attention.  If you think that some great series is undeservedly overlooked, then write - we will add to the list. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">And if you not only love TV shows, but also work, come to us!</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/RI-02.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-2018-07-24%26utm_campaign%3Dtv">SMM Project Manager</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/RI-03.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-2018-07-24%26utm_campaign%3Dtv">Digital designer in SMM</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/K-17.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-2018-07-24%26utm_campaign%3Dtv">Affiliate Network Development Manager</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/HD-03.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-2018-07-24%26utm_campaign%3Dtv">Unity developer</a> </li></ul></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/417643/">https://habr.com/ru/post/417643/</a></p>
