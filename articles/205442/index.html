  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Distribution of servers: sum up</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Summing up the results of our server distribution competition reminded us a bit of the famous episode from the cartoon ‚ÄúProstokvashino‚Äù: <br>  ‚ÄúAnd now you‚Äôll run after him for half a day.‚Äù <br>  - Why is that? <br>  - And to give a photo. <br>  Due to the current situation, we did not have time to publish the results in time.  However, access to the winners is granted, and you can officially sum up. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let me remind you that almost a month ago we announced a contest, the prizes for which were 5 servers of the configuration <a href="http://ua-hosting.com.ua/nl-servers.html">Intel Xeon E3-1230 / 8GB DDR3 / 4x1TB SATA2 / 100Mbps Unmetered</a> in DC EvoSwitch (Netherlands).  During the time allotted for submission of applications, we received more than 40 of them and selected 26 to participate in the voting.  Two authors out of the competition received an offer to use hosting for free. <br><br>  In the last post, I promised everyone, whose application was not selected, to indicate the reason.  Unfortunately, I did not have time, because the main reasons, which are quite massively met, are stated here.  Read, refresh the text of your application and correct it for the second round (but more on that later).  So, among the causes of failure (according to the degree of decreasing prevalence) were: <br><ul><li>  the lack of an explicit indication of the degree of readiness of the project (one of the conditions for participation in the competition was the presence of a working prototype for which, in fact, would need a server); </li><li>  the project is in its infancy (the state is ‚ÄúI am full of ideas, but I have not even sat down yet‚Äù); </li><li>  lack of any purpose or benefit from the project; </li><li>  an attempt to place a completely commercial project for free that is already able to pay for itself. </li></ul><br>  And our winners are: <br><ul><li>  The <a href="http://www.reactos.org/ru">ReactOS</a> project became the absolute leader and the winner of the competition.  In the voting I scored +72, as well as 7 positive comments, which also added.  As the representative of the project admitted, he himself did not expect such support.  Well, it remains to wish success in the development of the project and pleasant work on our server. </li><li>  The <a href="http://libs.ru/">Libs.ru</a> project ranked second with a significant margin, dialing +37.  However, by the time the server was ready for issuance, the participant refused it, so we moved the rating list. </li><li>  Third place with a score of +29 scored a project <a href="http://shifo.org/">Shifo</a> .  We wish the authors good luck in the development and implementation of their ideas. </li><li>  The fourth place with the result of +13 and the server, which was refused by one of the winners, received the project <a href="http://sport.vyatk.in/">http://sport.vyatk.in/</a> . </li></ul><br>  Two projects at our discretion, we sent a proposal to get the server, but from one did not receive an answer.  We will not call them if they want - let them respond in the comments.

    <h4>  The second contest is coming </h4><br>  In the near future (tentatively on December 16) we plan to announce the start of the second contest.  We have a week to take into account the experience gained and to modify the scheme a little, you have to prepare applications in accordance with the rules.  As in the first competition, the mandatory conditions will be the project‚Äôs purpose, visible benefits and a working prototype for which a server is already needed.  Perhaps we will change some time frames and the number of prizes.  Carefully follow the announcements. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205442/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205442/</a></p>
