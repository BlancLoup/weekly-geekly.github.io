  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We have control at our finger tips ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What is the main task of CRM?  Right!  Bring the sales process to an easy and enjoyable pastime.  It is fun to chat on the phone and the statistics of these events is accurately formed in the history of the client.  Send one click mouse KP, invoice, contract, specification and terms of reference by pressing 1 button on the keyboard.  Paid bills evenly cover the entire screen, the sales funnel looks like a vertical pillar with a rate of 100%.  But there is one ‚Äúnice‚Äù thing between the payment of the invoice and the signing of the closing documents.  Called "the execution of works" (or the delivery of goods, or the provision of services, etc.).  Here lies a small but insidious "system bug." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/320/2e3/4f4/3202e34f4a28437eb5512c403e70c07b.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On the one hand, the manager did his job, the manager can leave.  But!  On the other hand, very often, the transaction is not closed, which means it does not fall into the plan of completed tasks.  The amount of payment is not included in the offset manager.  And if, God forbid, the terms were also ‚Äústeamed‚Äù ... Then a dissatisfied customer calls to someone ????  Right!  Anyone who sang sweetly on the phone about the reliability of the company, the inviolability of the contract and other pleasures of life.  What to do?  To lead a project?  But this is another accounting system, another interface and other complexities of this project management system.  Yes, and do not need this to happen.  I just want to know that Vasya drew the design of the site on time, Kolya folded it in time and gave it to Semen.  And Simon at the appointed time created a prototype of the site and gave it to Alexander for testing.  Alexander thoroughly tested his bugreport and Simon as soon as possible fixed everything and provided the site to the customer.  One timely call to the people involved will not allow the project to collapse at the peak of the deadline.  What is provided for this in <a href="http://yoolla.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dstatya%26utm_campaign%3Dkontrolnye_tochki">YoollaCRM</a> ?  In our system there is the concept of <b>control points</b> .  These events are not related to the actual sale process itself, but indirectly affect the success of the transaction.  They can be installed both by the manager and his manager.  This is an option, and you can skip it and not set control points at all.  And you can put only a part of them.  How to use them? <br>  For a start, determine the control points themselves.  How many of them will be, as they will be called <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2e/d5b/85f/b2ed5b85f2644ccfb4b2018e8c9454b9.jpg"><br>  The control point can be tied to the stage of the transaction, but you can not tie.  If you tie it to the stage, then you can change it to the next one only if the control point is executed.  For example, subject to payment. <br>  By adding a checkpoint you can specify the roles and users who have access to this point. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b5/d38/2f5/4b5d382f51b04ffcb2d9b7e53cdbc029.jpeg"><br>  In our case, we added the following points: design creation, prototyping, testing, the work was completely completed. <br>  At the beginning of work, the manager has an idea how long it takes for each stage.  And puts control points, according to this knowledge. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c8/5a7/4b2/3c85a74b2c654dddb026e553a9c25803.jpeg"><br>  Putting control points, we get about this picture in the transaction card <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea5/a73/f1f/ea5a73f1f4dd409db5bf9f4849d863c0.jpeg"><br>  With the passage of control points will appear a mark on the actual performance of work.  Later, the manager will be able to analyze the reports where there were problems in the execution of the transaction. <br>  And the employee on the desktop in the "Health" section shows a display of all his transactions and their status.  If the deadline of the control point (or the entire transaction) has passed, and it is not marked as completed, then such a transaction will be tinted red in the list.  The deal in which everything goes according to plan is marked green.  A transaction in which there are no control points has a white background. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5c/0e9/c96/b5c0e9c96f6f42d2a7116b8573754d44.jpg"><br>  By clicking on the deal, we can see which control point is the closest and how much is left before the "deadline" <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/700/048/654/7000486549b642248fa5e5db338cae61.jpeg"><br>  Have the payment and when the transaction should be closed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b40/bee/f6b/b40beef6bf49493484894d86a4def5c1.jpeg"><br>  As a result of such simple movements, we get closer control over the process of work performance.  This is to replace the full project management system.  But for most small and small enterprises this is enough to manage their projects.  Find out when the machine comes with spare parts to send the masters to the customer to repair the refrigerator.  Check when the print shop prints your circulation of flyers to send promoters to the BC.  Check the delivery time of the paper to be sent to print self-adhesive for the client, etc.  etc.  And it‚Äôs not at all necessary for a manager to know how many man-hours are required for programming a prototype.  It is enough to call the head of the development department (or write to the corporate chat) with the question ‚Äúdo we fit in time, Simon‚Äù?  Simon will check the wards, will give acceleration sluggish and ... TA-YES !!!  Project delivered on time.  Everyone received awards and went on pink ponies in the rainbow ... It is enough just to not forget about the people who are ‚Äúsawing‚Äù the project with you.  And as the manager depends on the performance of work, so are the developers, designers, analysts, and so forth, and so on, depending on the work of the manager.  Therefore, it is better to do everything in command.  And <a href="http://yoolla.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dstatya%26utm_campaign%3Dkontrolnye_tochki">YoollaCRM will</a> actively help you in this. </div>
