  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do not give up your business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  good day <br>  This article is based on the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/55143/">"Life after freelancing</a> . <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/55143/">"</a>  This article touched me by the fact that I saw in it a hint of something different from my views on life.  Below, I will tell the story of my startup that would be clear about what it was about. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It all started in the late 90s.  I was engaged in accompanying one of the accounting systems.  I was designed as a unincorporated business (the IP was formerly called), and fulfilled customer requests related to IT.  There were several people like me, and then we didn’t know the word freelancing.  At that time, I didn’t refuse to do any work, could carry out a rather complicated project, and then “weaken the site in FrontPage” for 100 bucks.  Sometimes I thought that it would be nice to return to salary and live peacefully, but 1998 happened and defaulted.  Then some organizations simply ceased to exist, others simply sent employees on leave without pay.  I had more or less everything is good - the income, of course, declined, but not critically.  If I worked at that time in any of the companies, there would be no guarantee that I would be left without a means of livelihood, and no difference from the position held. <br><br>  Slowly, the country got out of the crisis, and the organization that supplied us with software decided to accompany it, and we had to work as full-time employees.  Such a disposition did not suit me, as a result of which LLC was created.  We were two co-founders.  We also received several people who have worked and still work with us.  Relations with them as with freelancers - we give them work, on a subcontract basis, which we are entrusted to do by our clients.  Slowly we recruited staff and expanded the scope of activities.  Everything became less tired and I felt bored again.  At this time, most did not want to turn into an office plankton.  But the financial crisis struck - and it became interesting again.

      There are people who need stability and consistency, their lot - work in the office.  There are those who cannot work monotonously, their own business is suitable for such.  As for career growth, this is how you develop your business: first, individual entrepreneurs, then the director of the company, then the president of the corporation :).  I also wanted to say one more thing about what - the transition from own business to hired employees is much easier than backwards.  My clients have had many cases in which employees suffered because of bosses, often with conflicting or incorrectly worded instructions.  Several times there were cases when people were deprived of bonuses due to the fact that they did not have time to complete certain projects on time, while the deadline was set 5-10 times less than necessary. <br><br>  And one more thought about who works for someone - you shouldn't think that you work as an uncle if you are on a salary in some organization, or vice versa, people work for you if you are an employer.  We all work on each other: employees on the director, fulfilling their duties, the director on them - through competent or not very leadership.  There is also the owner of the organization, who has invested his money in this business, i.e.  I worked on the director and employees in advance.  Here you need to think in a slightly different category - who has the main profit per unit of work done (to know how to measure this work), i.e.  if you are the owner of a certain organization and pay your employees more than you need (I don’t know how much I need), then it’s you who work for them.  If you are an employee of a certain organization and you are not paid enough, then you work for the organization.  If you have your own business and you have entered into an unsuccessful contract with a client, you work for your client. <br><br>  Summing up, I will say the following: your business is wonderful, both from a financial point of view and from the point of view of freedom (yes, you can spend more time on your business than working in an organization, but plan your schedule, weekends and holidays, and you can do it yourself).  The only thing you need to do is: enthusiasm, ingenuity, as well as knowledge and experience. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/55750/">https://habr.com/ru/post/55750/</a></p>
