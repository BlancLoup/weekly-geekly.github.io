The guys stole from the servers of one of the outside studios of the 5th season of the series ‚ÄúOrange Is the New Black‚Äù - and now spread them in open access.  In order for Netflix film studio not to lose its profits, it will have to pay out-of-pocket hackers. <br><br>  According to the schedule, the 5th season of the series should start from June 9, 2017.  But it is likely that some viewers will see it before, and even if they wish, they will not be able to pay anyone to watch it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúOrange is the hit of the season‚Äù is a popular comedy and drama series about life in a women's prison, based on real events.  In 2014, the series was nominated for an Emmy Award in 12 categories, including as the Best Comedy Series, winning three awards.  In 2015, he received the award for ‚ÄúBest Drama Series‚Äù.  In 2016, it became the <a href="http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/orange-is-the-new-black-renewed-3-seasons-netflix-1201698227/">most popular</a> (by the number of views) original series on Netflix - such recognition is worth a lot, both literally and figuratively.  Largely due to this show, Netflix <a href="https://apnews.com/48d3546bfca94692b42a57cd21367480/Hacker-threatens-to-release-stolen-copies-of-Netflix-series">expects to add 3.2 million paid subscribers by</a> June 2017.

      TheDarkOverlord Solutions group has published a <a href="https%253A%252F%252Fpastebin.com%252FFKZAafQd%26aqs%3Dchrome..69i57j69i58.4464j0j7%26sourceid%3Dchrome%26ie%3DUTF-8">statement</a> telling the hacking story. <br><br>  Hackers say that they managed to get access to servers of a certain company, where they found a lot of interesting things, including the 5th season of the TV series ‚ÄúOrange - hit of the season‚Äù, as well as several films (or TV shows) of other studios.  But hackers focused on Netflix. <br><br>  Since before the official release of the 5th season a few more months, the hackers decided to wait for the official trailer to check the authenticity of the downloaded content.  In the end, on April 11, 2017, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dg3cv82rN-ts">the official trailer was released</a> - and everything was confirmed.  All frames coincided with the downloaded series. <br><br>  Having in their hands evidence of the authenticity of the series, the hackers politely made a proposal to conclude a mutually beneficial agreement for them to receive the money, and the studio did not screw up with the premiere.  But they did not receive an answer to their proposal, which greatly offended the guys. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNow, since we are punishing the guilty due to the defendant, other companies from the American entertainment industry should not be surprised if they, too, once find in the mailbox a wordy, condescending and abusive letter offering a hand of friendship and (most likely) requiring a modest amount Internet money ", - write hackers.  They recognize that the concept of a ‚Äúmodest amount‚Äù is very relative.  But in fact, any amount they offer can be considered modest: "Maybe we are malicious Internet hooligans, but not irresponsible creatures." <br><br>  April 29, 2017, the 1st episode of the 5th season ‚ÄúOrange - hit of the season‚Äù <a href="https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/17685791/Orange_Is_The_New_Black_%25282013-%2529_-_S05E01">went into torrents</a> , to the great joy of the fans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f9/f00/859/7f9f008593444799906230484368dd8e.png"><br><br>  Hackers say they are not refusing further negotiations, so they have published only the first series so far.  If the studio does not get in touch, they will lay out the entire series. <br><br>  Today, TheDarkOverlord Solutions group on Twitter announced that they also have films / series produced by ABC, FOX, IFC and National Geographic.  ‚ÄúWe are no longer playing games,‚Äù said the serious guys. <br><br>  According <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/hackers-leak-netflixs-orange-is-the-new-black-season-5-premiere-170429/">to</a> <i>TorrentFreak</i> , the source of the leak is the company Larson Studios, the contractor of many Hollywood film studios.  This company is engaged in audio processing, namely - the duplication of films on technology ADR (Automatic Dialog Replacement).  Technology implies a separate recording of conversations in the studio on good audio equipment.  Then this sound is imposed on the original material, where the sound quality is always worse.  Apparently, the hackers broke into the servers of this particular company and demanded a ransom from her initially.  Having received no response, they aimed at Netflix. <br><br>  Netflix acknowledged the leak: ‚ÄúWe are aware of the situation.  A contractor who works with several large studios has been compromised security system.  Law enforcement agencies are already doing business. ‚Äù <br><br>  Just a few hours ago (at about 15:00 Moscow time), the hacker group TheDarkOverlord Solutions published a <a href="https://pastebin.com/ZUYWMKh8">new statement</a> .  They congratulate the studio Netflix with the fact that its employees were among the first to download the series from torrents (Priver, IP address 69.53.235.76).  So they got the message, but they still did not respond to the offer.  Therefore, after lengthy discussions in the presence of alcohol, hackers decided to post also series 2-10 of the 13 episodes of the 5th season: a <a href="https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/17689057/">link to a torrent</a> (11.46 GiB). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d5/7ae/fcb/6d57aefcb93641d5a95379cbc7c38f68.png"><br><br>  Probably, in Netflix now they bite their elbows, why didn‚Äôt they pay.  There is only one way out - to urgently postpone the premiere of the series from June 9 to April 30. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403621/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403621/</a></p>
