Therefore, we turned to our regular customers - professional installers with questions on the topic: <b>‚ÄúHow will the growth of IoT affect the smart home installation market?‚Äù</b> In addition, we wondered if this is a global trend or are there any geographical boundaries?  Therefore, we conducted a survey in English and Russian.  That's what we did. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63c/927/ad1/63c927ad1bf44e38bb4dcab9f1954c4b.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Question 1: How will the spread of the Internet of things affect the professional installation market?</b> <br><br>  Answers Russian-speaking participants <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/815/386/71f/81538671ff29435baeb2441db3d3a54a.png" alt="image">

      Answers English-speaking participants <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d3b/35b/eb2/d3b35beb2c3d41a0bf86472d8860ea0b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It is clearly seen from the graphs that Russian-speaking and English-speaking integrators agree on successful integration and mutually beneficial coexistence of two modern IT concepts.  At the same time, foreign specialists are more optimistic in their assessment compared to Russian integrators: 73% and 61% of answers, respectively.  This, quite, can be explained by the fact that the Western world is a little longer familiar with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsmart homes and the concept of the Internet of Things, that is, experts see their development in a longer-term retrospective, which allows them to make more optimistic forecasts for the future.  Foreign experts do not see in the IoT market a threat to themselves or their business. <br><br>  <b>Question 2: What happens if Wi-Fi (Z-Wave / Zigbee / Bluetooth) bulbs appear in all stores for more than an acceptable price?</b>  <b>How will this affect the sales of installation lighting control devices (KNX, Lutron, HDL, etc.)?</b> <br><br>  Answers Russian-speaking participants <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce2/481/7a1/ce24817a151a4421af0dccb4a803b194.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Answers English-speaking participants <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1bf/b35/3f4/1bfb353f42fa48709f4b481e46497147.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Comparing the answers to the second question, we got a rather interesting picture.  Answers in Russian (31%, 32% and 37% for each of the options) show some caution of Russian professionals in assessing the extent to which the Internet of Things influences the home automation market.  They are not sure whether this new emerging concept will be able to reach the mainstream level.  Foreign experts, on the contrary, again make more optimistic forecasts.  Almost half of the respondents (46%) are confident that the development of the concept of the Internet of things will have a positive effect on the market of professional installations, as it will make the home automation market more massive. <br><br>  <b>Question 3: What would you advise the customer for climate systems at the facility?</b> <br><br>  Answers Russian-speaking participants <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ad/9fe/27c/9ad9fe27c2d3446fbf9592a81b8f7ab3.png" alt="image"><br>  Answers English-speaking participants <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38b/948/5b3/38b9485b3c5f4ee89127278bf4e481c4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Both Russian and foreign experts in the overwhelming majority of cases believe that climate systems should be connected to the network of a smart home.  However, opinions differ significantly as to exactly which devices need to be connected.  Russian experts prefer to use third-party devices and integrate them into projects through the gateway.  In more than half of the cases, foreign engineers prefer the controllers of the Smart Home systems, rather than third-party devices.  This may be due to the system of training integrators abroad.  Specialists are taught to work with a certain type of equipment, therefore, they will use such equipment in their projects.  In Russia, the situation is different.  There is no well-established system of training, as a result, integrators are trying to work with different types of equipment, both belonging to the system of smart homes, and not.  Therefore, the integration of equipment of different types in one project is considered as an acceptable option. <br><br>  <b>Question 4: What would you rather advise the customer for the on-site music systems?</b> <br><br>  Answers Russian-speaking participants <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f0e/a8b/50a/f0ea8b50a42648beac70e119f50988df.png" alt="image"><br>  Answers English-speaking participants <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45f/b1e/36b/45fb1e36b8064c64ac3a7ba05470e172.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Amazing unanimity showed all respondents in response to a question on the recommended multi-room systems.  Most experts prefer Multiroom IP systems, such as Sonos, Nuvo, etc., which is understandable.  TCP / IP based systems are characterized by flexibility, scalability, ease of operation, and reasonable cost of final solutions. <br><br>  <b>Question 5: What would you recommend to the customer for remote notification of the client about any event in the house?</b> <br><br>  Answers Russian-speaking participants <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e7/dba/205/6e7dba20537b483daf5ef2b6db0b9f67.png" alt="image"><br>  Answers English-speaking participants <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b51/d8f/560/b51d8f5600bc4559acbaa3b08734c4d8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As can be seen from the diagrams, preferences in choosing the method of notification about events in a smart home are significantly different from representatives of different countries.  English-speaking respondents in most cases (64%) choose push-notifications, the majority of Russian-speaking (59%) prefer SMS from a GSM controller at the facility.  Most likely, this is due to the fact that the mobile Internet (necessary for the operation of push-notifications) in Europe and the United States has a much greater coverage and quality of coverage compared to Russia.  For the same reason, an e-mail alert is quite popular.  In Russia, of all the above notification methods, SMS from a GSM controller installed at the facility is more reliable at the moment, which explains its high popularity. <br><br>  <i>To summarize</i> , specialists in the field of automation, both English-speaking and Russian-speaking, do not see in the concept of the Internet of Things any threat to the market of professional installations.  At the same time, foreign experts are more optimistic about the prospects for the interaction of these two current trends. <br><br>  <b>Comments of survey participants:</b> <br><br>  In order for the Internet of things to play a prominent role ... professional automation systems must have auto-configuration tools.  While there are no such systems, all this will remain just toys ... <br>  <i>Vadim Krysov, representative of EVIKA in the Urals Federal District</i> <br><br>  The faster in our country the production of Smart Home systems is established, the more likely these systems will cease to be systems for the rich, and will become publicly available ... <br>  <i>Vadim Balashov, Vector LLC</i> <br><br>  The main change for professional integrators lies in the need to become adaptive.  Someone wants to use AppleTV and their account in the AppStore, someone wants the old-fashioned stand in the basement with a bunch of movies and music.  And the specialist must find high-quality solutions for different requests.  An integrator who wants to survive in the IoT world will need to offer what the customer doesn‚Äôt buy at the store (integration with bracelets, TV, custom design, etc.) <br>  <i>Anton Titov</i> <br><br>  There is a lack of a unique software solution for all new devices and devices, there is also no single protocol for communicating all the new ‚ÄúGadgets‚Äù.  This aspect makes it difficult to put into operation and the current system of "smart homes".  Various light bulbs, weather and climate stations. <br>  <i>Alexey Ryabushkin, Domus Sapiens</i> <br><br>  The growth of the Internet of Things will increase the interest in smart homes and, perhaps, will kill part of the professional market.  First, people need to understand that devices from the Internet of Things are just gadgets.  Professional installation is completely different.  Those who are now paying for smart homes will continue to pay for professional installations.  Some clients, fans of various gadgets (Bose, Apple, etc.), for sure (by 85%), will choose devices from the Internet of Things instead of professional solutions. <br>  <i>Bogdan Dragoi, iRidium mobile distributor in Romania</i> <br><br>  I think that the opposition ‚Äúwill kill vs will develop‚Äù is too dramatic.  I hope that the Internet of things and professional smart homes will grow in parallel, each within its own market. <br>  <i>Derek R. Flickinger, Interactive Homes, Inc.</i> <br><br>  It all depends on how much technology is invested in each device.  For example, it will be a waste of time to control each light individually if it is possible to program the management of groups and easily create scenarios, thus old equipment will become useless. <br>  <i>Richard Ryan, Platinum Integration</i> <br><br>  We got some pretty interesting results.  We will also be happy to hear your opinion on this issue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374913/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374913/</a></p>
