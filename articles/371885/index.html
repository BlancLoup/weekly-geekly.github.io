You may have heard about the first version of the very original product of the company PopSLATE from Palo Alto - the eponymous case for the iPhone 5 with an additional screen on the back, supporting the technology of electronic ink E-ink.  In general, <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/popslate-second-screen-case-for-your-smart-phone">popSLATE</a> was greeted by connoisseurs of Apple mobile devices very favorably.  Not stopping on their laurels, the popSLATE developers were able to take into account the wishes of the users of the product and in the allotted time to seriously refine the previously proposed concept.  Now, 3 years after the appearance of the first child, an updated version of the popSLATE case is available on pre-order on the Indiegogo platform, where it has already managed to collect an amount that is more than four times the amount claimed. <br><br>  As in the previous version, popSLATE 2 has its own processor, memory and electrophoretic E-ink screen, on which you can display a lot of useful information, traditionally devouring a considerable part of the smartphone battery capacity.  An updated version of the case, popSLATE 2 is now equipped with an anti-glare unbreakable screen of 4.3 inches and 4.7 inches (for versions 6 / 6s and 6 Plus / 6s Plus, respectively) with a pixel density of 200dpi.  Recall that in the previous version with 4-inch E-ink screen, this figure was 155 dpi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5a/844/089/a5a844089a834a31a379e23fa1f912a6.png">

      Access to instant news bulletins, diary, ticket information, digital wallet, e-book pages, weather and discount information, social media correspondence, etc. is provided. It is worth noting that the time required for processing information and changing the picture has decreased, on average, from 2 seconds to 0.1 seconds. <br><br>  At the same time, expanding the functionality of the menu and the appearance of two additional navigation buttons under the screen are pleasant and useful, but not the main feature of the updated popSLATE 2. The adjustments made to the hardware ‚Äúbasket‚Äù of the accessory look much more interesting.  Despite the fact that the E-ink screen practically does not waste the life of the main battery of the smartphone, spending energy only at the moment of changing the picture, the developers considered this solution half-and-half. <br><br>  The final version of the popSLATE 2 case now has <i>its own</i> built- <i>in battery</i> (capacity not reported), which can be used as a backup power source, adding up to 9 hours of talk time and 5 hours of Internet access for iPhone 6 + / 6S + to the main battery life or 6 hours of conversation and 4 hours of Internet time for the iPhone 6 / 6S.  It is noteworthy that the accessory itself became thinner by 2 mm, reaching a record thickness of 4 mm (versus 6.5 mm in popSLATE 1).  This fact will undoubtedly please the users of iPhone 6 / 6s and iPhone 6 Plus / 6s Plus, taking into account not only the functionality, performance and ergonomics, but also the design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90b/620/588/90b62058810e4fd3b9aa2fea50f7b5aa.png"><br><br>  In addition to the aforementioned innovations, the method of connecting the case to the smartphone has also changed.  In the popSLATE 2 version, the connection is made via the Lightning connector, which is used to simultaneously charge the batteries of both devices. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/H7LFdSfEtDg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhiojNcxuqD_fJFni1wrW1AtMub5Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">FAQ</font> </h2><br>  What phone models are compatible with popSLATE 2? <br><br>  <i>popSLATE 2 will be compatible with iPhone 6, 6S, 6+, and 6S +.</i>  <i>We are currently working on prototypes for combining with other devices.</i> <br><br>  Does popSLATE 2 have an extra battery for my smartphone? <br><br>  <i>Under normal use, the popSLATE 2 battery will provide up to an additional 9 hours of talk time and 5 hours of Internet time on iPhone 6S Plus, or an additional 6 hours of talk time and 4 hours of Internet time for iPhone 6S.</i>  <i>In addition, by transferring tasks to the popSLATE 2 screen with ultra-low power consumption without the need to unlock and use the energy-intensive screen of the iPhone, we expect significant savings in the life of the main iPhone battery.</i> <br><br>  How to charge popSLATE? <br><br>  <i>The smartphone and case are charged through a single connector on your popSLATE 2, so you can charge both devices at the same time using a standard Lightning cable.</i> <br><br>  How long does it take to charge my own battery when working with popSLATE 2? <br><br>  <i>You don‚Äôt have to worry about charging your popSLATE, because its battery is capable of significantly longer operation than the iPhone battery, and both devices are charging at the same time.</i> <br><br>  Will popSLATE somehow affect the quality of the connection or my NFC operations? <br><br>  <i>No, popSLATE was developed taking into account the technical features of the Apple iPhone, tested in accordance with the requirements of the MFI and confirmed the absence of any influence on the quality of communication and the progress of operations.</i> <br><br>  How fragile is popSLATE?
