The first Nokia smartphones on Windows Phone 7 were demonstrated at Nokia World 2011. In total, two models were presented - the <a href="http://www.nokia.ru/products/phones/nokia-lumia-800%3Fcid%3Dncomprod-fw-scl-na-habrlink_0x0-lumia-othsocmedia-ru-ru-1todtmtce619e">Lumia 800</a> and <a href="http://www.nokia.ru/products/phones/nokia-lumia-710%3Fcid%3Dncomprod-fw-scl-na-habrlink_0x0-habrlumia7-othsocmedia-ru-ru-1todtmt033ca3">Lumia 710</a> .  The first smartphone, the Lumia 800, is a flagship with a body similar to the Nokia N9.  Lumia 710, by contrast, is a more budget model for the widest audience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/4622400d/50476681/e49a04ef/e81bb938.jpg"><br><br>  Each smartphone deserves a separate review, and we will publish them later, and now let's look at the basic qualities of new smartphones.  And we will begin, of course, with the flagship Nokia Lumia 800.

    <a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Nokia Lumia 800 </h4><br>  Rumors about the design were confirmed.  Externally, the <a href="http://www.nokia.ru/products/phones/nokia-lumia-800%3Fcid%3Dncomprod-fw-scl-na-habrlink_0x0-lumia-othsocmedia-ru-ru-1todtmtce619e">Lumia 800 is</a> really not much different from the N9: it‚Äôs still the same solid polycarbonate casing that proved itself in the Nokia N9.  The only difference from the MeeGo smartphone are the three buttons on the front panel, located below the screen: these are the Back, Menu and Search buttons, which are responsible for navigation.  On the front side there is a key responsible for quick activation of the camera;  If you have blocked your smartphone, a two-second hold of the camera button will allow you to turn it on without having to enter a password - this is the best way to capture any interesting moment in the form of a photo or HD-video on an integrated camera with an 8 megapixel matrix and Carl Zeiss optics. <br><br>  Speaking about the operating system Windows Phone 7, I would like to mention a very simple and intuitive interface.  The Windows Phone 7 system is not cluttered with various graphical garbage, instead, the OS creators relied on the design with a simple but stylish typography, thereby killing two birds with one stone: the light interface not only looks nice and fresh (compared to other OS), but also quite undemanding on smartphone resources, providing smooth transitions between screens and instant response to any user actions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/660f8011/e0381e47/7dabeb7d/b4ee123b.jpg"><br><br>  The processor with a clock frequency of 1.4 GHz, coupled with a separate graphics processor with a bang, copes with all its tasks and applications.  You can check the overall speed of the system on the Nokia Navigation application (Nokia Drive), exclusive for WP7-Nokia smartphones - this is a full-featured car navigator with voice prompts and offline operation (if you do not want to receive information about traffic jams, which is taken into account when building the optimal route ).  Nokia maps cover about 100 countries.  There is also a navigation for pedestrians - Nokia Maps.  It will soon appear in the Marketplace, the Windows Phone app store, and will be available for download on WP7 smartphones from all manufacturers. <br><br>  In addition to supporting the standard Windows Phone social networks Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, the Nokia Lumia 800 application will also be available for VKontakte.  Also in the Russian version of Lumia 800, the standard search service was changed: instead of Microsoft Bing, a search from Yandex is used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/bcba9923/6ef9dacb/7e78ab86/0962f72d.jpg"><br><br>  Nokia Lumia 800 is equipped with a special Nokia player that allows you to listen to tracks not only from your hard drive downloaded via Zune, but also from the Web through streaming.  Windows Phone 7 for Nokia also features free Internet Radio Mix Radio, which allows you to listen to hundreds of music channels.  At the end of the year will be an update, thanks to which the owners of Nokia Lumia themselves will be able to create personal music channels and share music through social networks. <br><br>  In addition, Nokia Lumia has the ‚ÄúContact Transfer‚Äù application preinstalled, which helps in just two clicks to transfer contacts from your old smartphone (it can be both iPhone and Android) to the new Nokia Lumia, for example, via Bluetooth. <br><br>  Of course, Internet Explorer 9, which supports the basic features of the HTML5 standard, and Microsoft Office are installed on Windows Phone 7.  Now the most popular office suite is available on mobile devices! <br><br>  The built-in Microsoft Outlook email client is a new, surprisingly high-quality product for working with mail correspondence.  Outlook allows you to fully manage your mailboxes, work with attachments in letters, notes and calendars.  The client fully supports corporate Exchange servers, and on Nokia Lumia, full integration with corporate Outlook can easily coexist with the Gmail home box ‚Äî calendars are easily synchronized and switched with one click. <br><br>  If you are missing some applications, you can always find the missing software in the Microsoft Marketplace.  In addition, we will select the best of the new applications and publish them in a special section of the Nokia directory along with our own applications and applications developed in partnership with Russian partners. <br><br>  Thanks to the support of the Microsoft SkyDrive cloud file storage, users can store their documents and media files on the Web for free without spending space on their smartphone.  It is very convenient to use such storage, and in case of lack of free space, additional gigabytes can always be purchased for a small amount of money. <br><br>  Nokia Lumia 800 will be available in Russia in December.  Estimated price - 21 000 rubles.  Nokia Purity HD Stereo Headset overhead headphones as well as Nokia Purity Stereo Headset overhead headphones will appear on the market, the design and construction of which were developed in collaboration with Monster Cable, the recognized world market leader in premium audio accessories. <br><br><h4>  Nokia Lumia 710 </h4><br>  This is a candybar with a touch screen and a similar processor Nokia Lumia 800 - 1.4 GHz.  The smartphone, though not a flagship, is still very smart: thanks to the ease of Windows Phone 7 and the simplicity of the implementation of graphic elements, navigation, movement, switching between applications - all this happens almost instantly.  In the case of the <a href="http://www.nokia.ru/products/phones/nokia-lumia-710%3Fcid%3Dncomprod-fw-scl-na-habrlink_0x0-habrlumia7-othsocmedia-ru-ru-1todtmt033ca3">Nokia Lumia 710, the</a> user will get functionality close to the Nokia Lumia 800, but at a more affordable price.  And savings are achieved through the use of more traditional and not as revolutionary, as in the case of the Nokia Lumia 800 iron components. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5b4b3fc8/a4d4806f/2faa0ae6/5647ccc6.jpg"><br><br>  Approximately, the model will appear in Russia in December at a price of 13,500 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/310e1b3a/29fcbc50/c45631c6/bf1bbee1.jpg"><br><br>  I would like to know your opinion on the new products: about both the Nokia Lumia series and Windows Phone 7 itself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131286/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131286/</a></p>
