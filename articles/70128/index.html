  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Radio without batteries</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Can a radio receiver consist of less than 10 parts and work without batteries? <br><br>  Yes, it can: the detector radio receivers are very simple and can work, receiving power only from radio waves.  In this article I will describe how you can do such a thing with your own hands, spending no more than an hour on all the work!  ;) <br><br>  What good detector radio? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, this receiver works without batteries.  Secondly, all the necessary parts cost about 10-15 rubles, and in the old equipment they are in abundance.  Thirdly, everyone can assemble the receiver, regardless of the available skills (reading and working with a soldering iron are welcome :-)

      But there are drawbacks.  Most likely, only one station will be well received, drowning out all the others (usually it is ‚ÄúBeacon‚Äù).  The second drawback is low power.  It will be enough to give a normal sound from the headset, but no more. <br><br>  Anyway, such a receiver can be a good helper in the country, when there are interruptions in electricity or it is difficult to buy batteries.  At my dacha there are already 4 such receivers throughout the house, the grandfather will not rejoice in them =) <br><br>  What do we need to build? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Condenser constant 190-500 PF <br>  ‚Ä¢ Capacitor 1000-2000 PF <br>  ‚Ä¢ Any diode (except light) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Copper wire with a diameter of 1-0.1 mm <br>  ‚Ä¢ A cylinder with a diameter of 10 cm (for example, a can of coffee) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Newspaper <br>  ‚Ä¢ Metal pin about 30 cm in length for grounding <br>  ‚Ä¢ Small speaker, for example from an old dial-up phone. <br><br>  Here is the diagram of the detector radio Oganov: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/883/ee3/dac/883ee3dac5a766a573bf2b23ca762d2f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We begin with the simplest - with grounding.  We drive a metal pin into the ground, having previously attached a wire to it (for safety reasons, the radiator should not be used as a ground connection).  And remember that the better the grounding, the better the reception will be.  It is best to establish grounding on the side of the house, where the sun is the least hit, where the earth is always damp.  The end of the grounding conduct in the house and fasten to the appropriate output of the receiver. <br><br>  The next step is to create an antenna.  I have it held under the roof, about 10 meters long.  You can make it, for example, from copper wire.  Practice shows that with a 10 m antenna, only one station will be received, but loudly.  With an antenna length of 1-3 meters, it will be possible to catch other stations, but all of them will be very hard to hear. <br><br>  Next, take up the coil.  The coil consists of two equal parts, 20 turns each (this is for receiving medium waves, and for receiving long ones, you need to wind 60 turns).  How to make a coil?  We take something round with a diameter of about 10 cm (for example, a can of coffee), glue a double layer of newspaper.  The first layer is attached to the bank with scotch tape, the second is loosely wound onto the first one.  In this case, the coil after winding will be easy to remove.  Now gently wind the copper wire - turn to the turn.  Between the two parts of the coil we leave 5 centimeters of wire, and also do not forget to leave about the same amount of wire at the entrance and exit.  After you have wound the coil, it should be wound with tape in two layers along the turns.  And after removing it from the jar, wind it across.  Yes, we will no longer need the newspaper, we can get rid of it with a clear conscience!  =) <br><br>  Finally, proceed to the assembly of the receiver! <br><br>  The scheme above can be simplified to the following form: <br><br><img src="http://i010.radikal.ru/0909/00/d4b45517b782.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In this form, the easiest way to solder it, and the wires will end up with less.  Carefully clean all parts and solder them to each other!  8-) Attach a coil, antenna, ground, earphone and, if done correctly, enjoy a clean and smooth reception of the Beacon!  =) <br><br>  If you want to tune in to a different frequency, or the reception quality is far from ideal, take a coil of thicker wire. <br><br>  Adjustment is made by moving one part of the coil relative to another.  For the most accurate tuning, you can take several variable capacitors that replace C1; by tuning them you can tune in to the station as accurately as possible. <br><br>  It will look like the receiver - it depends only on your imagination!  Due to its small size, it can be packaged in almost any container.  In the photo, one of my 4 receivers is a wall model with a toggle switch for power off (the radio and coils are in a black box, the white wire is ground and the antenna, and the black wire goes to the headset :) There were also more compact options, but their photos , Unfortunately not) <br><br><img src="http://i058.radikal.ru/0909/e2/549d0883b4be.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, everything, I hope that this material will be useful to someone =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70128/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70128/</a></p>
