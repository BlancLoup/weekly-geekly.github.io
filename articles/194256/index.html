  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Zodiac Vortex 3 Pool Cleaning Robot</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We continue to test household robots and talk about new products in robotics.  Not so long ago, pool cleaning robots appeared on the Russian market.  Among the most famous manufacturers: iRobot (USA), Zodiac (France), Dolphin (Israel) and some others.  Swimming pool robots of iRobot are not officially brought to Russia.  According to the exclusive representative, this type of robots is too low in demand.  On the other hand, Zodiac and Dolphin robots are actively sold.  In the article we will look at the effectiveness and feasibility of buying a popular model Zodiac Vortex 3. We will test the device in the field.  To do this, we use the pool size of 3.5 by 7.5 meters, located on the street.  So let's go. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/42e/2e1/4ab/42e2e14ab4e21d6d0f0c768afcc57fe5.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Zodiac brand for over 100 years!  The company was founded back in 1909.  Initially focused on the development and assembly of boats and later became involved in all sorts of adaptations for swimming pools.  In particular, with the development of new technologies, Zodiac launched robots for cleaning pools.  Among the current models in the Russian market you will find: Zodiac Sweepy Free, Zodiac Indigo, Zodiac Cybernaut and the Vortex series.  It is the Vortex that represents the greatest interest in connection with the use of some interesting features and is one of the latest developments of the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/27e/614/9fa/27e6149faffc9dee66f943d9962db6f0.jpg" align="right" alt="image">  The younger Zodiac Vortex 1 model is suitable for cleaning the bottom of the pool. The robot is designed for pools of 10 mx 5 meters, has a power cord 18 meters long and moves with the help of two large wheels along the bottom.  To increase the cleaning efficiency of the bottom, the Vortex 1 uses small brushes on the bottom of the case.  But the effectiveness of this design is not as good as that of older models, whose large rubber brushes spin independently of the rotation of the drive wheels.  Vortex 1 is designed more to filter water.  He will not be able to clean the settled mucus and other heavy unpleasant sediment.  The cost of such a robot is about 30 000 rubles. <br><br>  For cleaning the bottom and walls, Vortex 3 and Vortex 4 models are suitable. Models differ only in the presence of a control panel and wire length: in the 3rd model its length is 18 meters, in the 4th one it is 21 meter.

      There are also versions with all-wheel drive, they are designated 4WD.  Four-wheel drive allows the robot to snuggle up tightly on the smooth surfaces of the pool walls.  In practice, the difference is not significant.  The difference of 10,000 rubles for an additional wheel drive, in our opinion, is not justified.  Speaking of the price of robots: Vortex 3 can be taken for 80,000 rubles, and the most expensive of this Vortex 4 4WD series costs about 110,000 rubles.  On the one hand, the money is substantial, on the other - not everyone can afford to install a swimming pool near the house, therefore, this product is designed for people of average and above average income level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb4/bbe/2e0/cb4bbe2e010251f786905500f608ebd1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Vortex series differs from other robots for reading pools with a rigid type of filter.  A powerful circular circulation inside the filter is created.  Particles of debris are kept in limbo, preventing clogging.  In addition, the robot has rubber brushes that rotate independently of the wheels.  In older models, for example, in Zodiac Indigo or Sweepy Free, the device moved along the bottom and walls, rolling on its rollers.  That is, rollers performed as the role of the wheels, and the role of cleaning modules.  Because of this, the cleaning efficiency was lower than in the Vortex series with independent rotation of the brushes. <br><br>  In this way, we get an efficient device for cleaning and filtering the pool, which is easy to operate.  So the manufacturer tells us, now let's move from theory to practice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2cd/0e4/c09/2cd0e4c093dbf9a2dec575679d4ecb6d.jpg" align="left" alt="image">  As a testing ground, we used a pool of 3.5 by 7.5 meters of rectangular shape.  No steps, only a ladder in the corner of the pool.  The material of the pool walls is polypropylene, that is, the surface is very smooth.  The pool is not full to the brim, so we can see if the robot cleans the waterline or not.  Chemistry in the form of tablets and liquids is used to maintain the purity of the water.  The owner of the pool tries to avoid frequent use of chemicals, so for 10 days the water had noticeably dimmed.  It is good for us, we will check whether the water will be cleaner after working Zodiac. <br><br>  The photo shows a trolley to move the robot (it weighs 9.5 kg).  The cart is quite high quality and there is no doubt about the deformation of the frame or the wheels.  The control panel is mounted in it.  With it, you can select the cleaning mode: only the bottom for 1.5 hours and the bottom with walls for 2.5 hours.  And also the indicator on the remote shows in what state Zodiac is now: it is cleaning or has already finished it. <br><br>  A 18-meter-long power cord (blue color) departs from the cart (for the Vortex 3 model under test).  Despite the fact that the robot is designed to clean the pool with a length of up to 12 meters, you can install a cart in the middle of the pool so that Zodiac can move the length of the wire and to the right and left.  In this case, the device can be used with large pools.  Efficiency in this case will be lower, since in view of the randomness of movement, the robot will not be able to cover the entire surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d3/59d/d12/8d359dd12ad9179f9b1a3595dae48d1b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As for the robot itself, it is designed as a racing futuristic sports car or something.  On the front of the case there is a carrying handle.  On the back of the nozzle, from which comes out quite a powerful stream of filtered water.  Wheels have a rubber coating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c57/a8b/231/c57a8b231cc6e5468b7c5c2e021f32fa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Vortex 3 is really easy to operate and clean.  To get the filter, you need to lift the housing cover.  The main space is occupied by a small-pored plastic filter.  It is also easy to remove and rinse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f9/191/770/2f9191770dccaa45a13235624f69ac2f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's start our testing.  We lower the robot for the pool into the water and select the mode using the remote control on the trolley.  Zodiac begins cleaning the pool.  The main garbage accumulates on the bottom of the pool, so the robot breaks the cleaning cycle into two parts: it spends about 70% of the time on cleaning the bottom and the remaining 30% on cleaning the walls.  The movements of the robot are chaotic, in a collision with a wall, he drives a little at it, then drives off in the opposite direction by 1.5-2 meters, slightly changes his course and moves to another wall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f8c/b47/973/f8cb47973c536465cf237e8c07402db4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For clarity of the device, we shot a video.  Our water was initially turbid, so we immediately apologize for the quality of the shooting.  In the process of testing, we hoped that the robot would be able to filter it and by the end of the work the water would become more transparent.  But that did not happen.  From here we conclude that the pool cleaning robots will not be able to completely replace the built-in pool cleaning system.  Without chemistry and bleach it is impossible to make clear water.  Zodiac is intended primarily to maintain cleanliness, but not for general cleaning. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9LjU3DWWRQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiwN7BNa-D5cgRFltQ5BFrkxb5EBg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Vortex also can not suck debris floating on the surface of the water.  But for these purposes, a skimmer is installed in any good pool - a filter for automatic garbage collection from the surface of the water.  Designed for the primary filtration of water entering the filter pump.  It is a funnel with a grid, which retains mechanical impurities, thanks to which the filtering pump picks up water cleared of coarse debris. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/751/3a4/1c7/7513a41c7481791a6b841426e3988331.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As mentioned earlier, the robot spends about 30% of the time on cleaning the walls.  It sticks to the wall and moves up to contact with the waterline.  Depending on the speed with which he manages to dial in a collision with a wall, he can rise either above the waterline, or only to its level.  After contact with air, Zodiac for some time continues to move parallel to the bottom, then slides down. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c65/48f/040/c6548f0409dd9347b6ab9d1686711d15.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In this mode, the robot could not for 2.5 hours to travel across the surface of the four walls.  He may drive along the same sections several times and at the same time leave some of the walls uncleaned.  Everything is like in the work of home vacuum cleaning robots with a chaotic type of movement.  The robot also cannot remove the eaten yellowness from the walls of the pool.  The usual rigid pool brush does it much better.  Well, the last fly in the ointment.  The robot can roll over with an inaccurate exit from the wall.  After a few seconds, he independently assumes the initial correct position, but the wire can pass directly under the device body.  He will continue to clean and will some time dragging under the power cord.  Also, the wire we once rolled into a loop, but after five minutes it became straight again.  In the photo you can see that the power cord runs just below the brushes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f1/e36/096/0f1e36096893aa81dbcd3fd45d84a06a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It may seem that the robot for cleaning the pool is just a toy and a show-off.  But in fact, not everything is so bad.  This is also the case with vacuum cleaning robots.  No need to make big demands on the device.  The robot vacuum cleaner allows you to keep the house clean, but it will not be able to perfectly lick the floors, general cleaning is still necessary sometimes.  You can read about our tests of robotic vacuum cleaners in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/qrobot/blog/192760/">previous article</a> .  The same applies to the pool cleaning robots. <br><br>  First, without the participation of the robot when cleaning with a vacuum brush, a large amount of water from the pool is drained and you have to fill in a new one, which leads to additional costs.  In fact, there is no longer any need to use a vacuum brush.  Once every two weeks, you can use a stiff brush to clean the walls of stubborn dirt and drive a robot to clean the pool once a week.  This will be enough to maintain the perfect cleanliness of the pool.  No waste of water. <br><br>  Secondly, the robot does an excellent job both with heavy debris and with sand settled on the bottom.  Powerful pump passes through the filter all the settled debris.  The condition of the filter after cleaning you can rate in the photo below.  It was not very pleasant to swim in all this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f3/f6a/1e0/1f3f6a1e0cac92a61101e4d54a13402c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thirdly, it really cleans the bottom very well even from unpleasant mucus.  All you have to do is press the button and return for the robot in 1.5-2.5 hours.  And on the walls, the dirt forms much longer than at the bottom, so once every 2-3 weeks you can take a brush with stiff bristles. <br><br>  What opinion do we have after the test?  To be honest, a little mixed. <br><br>  Pros: <br>  - high quality bottom cleaning <br>  - water level does not decrease <br>  - cleans the waterline <br>  - ease of use <br>  - high quality of assembly and materials, including the cart <br><br>  Minuses: <br>  - high price for relatively simple devices (in fact, it is simpler to design than a home robot vacuum cleaner) <br>  - does not completely clean the walls due to the randomness of the movement <br>  - cannot remove strong dirt from walls <br>  - sometimes confused in the power cord for a while <br><br>  The robot will certainly give you time.  Instead of exhausting vacuum cleaning, you can do other things.  Also, the cost of filling the pool with new water will be reduced, Zodiac filters all water.  It is unlikely that the Vortex will help greatly reduce the use of chemistry to clean the pool, but it will definitely support the high purity of the bottom and walls with regular use.  While there is only a question of price.  The robot is not a means of paramount importance when using the pool, so we recommend that you consider it for purchase if there are available funds. <br><br><h6>  In the following articles, we will be happy to tell you about the <a href="http://www.robomow.com/ru-Russia/">Robomow</a> lawn mower and the latest <a href="http://iwindoro.ru/windoro_wcr-l001">Windoro</a> window cleaning robot. </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/194256/">https://habr.com/ru/post/194256/</a></p>
