Spacious and bright room with seven-meter ceilings and windows of three human height. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/009/71c/136/00971c136595ce645bf964bdf1695a54.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  DI Telegraph is the first co-working in Russia, whose main task was not just the creation of a working space, but the formation of a full-fledged professional community.  Future co-workers of co-working are developers and owners of IT start-ups connecting creativity and technology, as well as representatives of creative professions.  <a href="http://dreamindustries.co/">Dream Industries</a> : <a href="http://bookmate.com/">Bookmate</a> , <a href="http://zvooq.ru/welcome/">Zvooq</a> and <a href="http://theoryandpractice.ru/">Theory &amp; Practice</a> will be the <a href="http://zvooq.ru/welcome/">co-working neighbors</a> .

    <a name="habracut"></a>  <b>What is a ‚Äúprofessional community‚Äù?</b> <br>  In the most general sense, a community is a group of people sharing common values ‚Äã‚Äãand common territory.  What kind of territory is involved in the case of coworking, obviously.  Therefore, we turn to the second component of the definition - values. <br><br>  The main values ‚Äã‚Äãof Dream Industries - the spread of culture and the exchange of knowledge through technology.  These two principles and became the basis for the creation of coworking DI Telegraph.  To date, co-working has emerged in Russia as a platform that sells a standard set of ‚Äúchair-table-Internet‚Äù.  We want to move away from this model towards a more progressive Western tradition.  If we take as an example such projects as IndyHall in Philadelphia, Betahaus in the cities of Europe and 1776 in Washington, we can see that a thoughtful and purposefully created community requires clear principles of work.  What are these principles? <br><br>  <b>1. People - first of all.</b> <br>  There will be no random people in our coworking.  All residents will preliminarily undergo an interview with the co-working curator.  The purpose of this meeting is to take care of the atmosphere in coworking and the desire to understand how the DI Telegraph and the potential resident are suited to each other.  Our goal is to ensure that all residents of the DI Telegraph have the opportunity to meet people who share their values. <br><br>  <b>2. Involvement</b> <br>  All co-working residents will be able to take part in educational lectures, master classes, meetings with mentors and experts, joint dinners, mit-ups and many other DI Telegraph events.  We encourage any participation and activity.  If the coworking administration sees that the resident does not use the opportunities that are provided to him, he may lose his place.  The rules stipulate the possibility of revising tariffs or terminating the contract unilaterally. <br><br>  <b>3. Mentor and consulting support.</b> <br>  We are building links with existing mentoring programs and gathering our pool of mentors.  Among them - <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/simon-dunlop">Simon Dunlop</a> (Co-founder of Dream Industries), <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mike-geer">Michael Gere</a> (COO AnchorFree), <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/grade-antony/13/495/a6">Anthony Grade</a> (Vice President of Design at Renault). <br><br>  <b>4. PR support</b> <br>  All residents of DI Telegraph will have the opportunity to talk about their projects to media representatives.  To do this, they will need to fill out a small report that is sent to the base of media partners.  Also, information about the success of residents will regularly appear on their own resources DI Telegraph: on the <a href="http://ditelegraph.com/">website</a> , in <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/ditelegraph">blogs</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TelegraphDI">social networks</a> . <br><br>  <b>5. Additional services</b> <br>  For an additional fee, co-working residents will be able to conclude contracts for any kind of legal and accounting services with companies whose quality of services has been verified by Dream Industries experts.  There will also be a courier service, preferential access to photo banks and other services. <br><br>  <b>What's next?</b> <br><br>  Coworking DI Telegraph only recently opened a public call for applications, but every day their number is growing rapidly.  Hurry up to take empty seats and get a chance to become part of the most promising start-up ecosystem project in Moscow!
