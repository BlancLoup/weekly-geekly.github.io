This is what I do if I am going to "spy" on a competitor: <br><br>  1. On Twitter, search for all @ client responses on the main competitors account and monitor it with <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/">TweetDeck</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/Accenture-Global-Consumer-Pulse-Research-Study-2013-Key-Findings.pdf">According to an Accenture study</a> , 66% of users stopped using the services of companies due to low quality service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62d/420/78e/62d42078e0bd4889864c0880ca34ab37.jpg"><br><br>  2. Set up an alert using <a href="https://en.mention.com/">Mention</a> , with which you will be informed about the mention of competitors' products on the Internet, both positive and negative. <br><br>  3. If they have a forum in which customers communicate, register there and watch for complaints and thanks. <br><br>  4. Read reviews and reviews about these products. <br><br>  This is necessary in order to find customers who have experience in choosing such products.  Using this information, you can: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ improve your own business, product quality; <br>  ‚Ä¢ emphasize your advantages over competitors. <br><br>  Also, instead of monitoring the main channels to promote competitors, you can see how they communicate in "hidden" communities. <br>  You need to drive the query ‚Äú[competitor‚Äôs company name] intitle: forum‚Äù into Google, and you will see not only the questions asked in the hidden communities, but also where the discussions are taking place. <br><br>  The MarketingSherpa has a great <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/how-to/5-tactics-to-research-your">article</a> that talks about other ways to ‚Äúspy on‚Äù a competitor not only online, but also offline. <br><br>  <b>We beat competitors in their sore spots</b> <br><br>  Spying on competitors and collecting information about them allows you to understand what their customers are talking about, as well as learn about the weak points of your rivals. <br><br>  For example, <a href="http://forums.3dcart.com/pre-sale-questions/2264-conversion-rates-steady-2.html">this post on the 3dcart forum</a> describes several weaknesses in the design of 3d Cart products and their customer service strategy. <br><br>  If a competing company in creating baskets for online stores wants to attract attention, it needs, analyzing the opponent's cons, to emphasize its following advantages: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ high speed and personalization; <br>  ‚Ä¢ improved customer support; <br>  ‚Ä¢ easily accessible switching to their service. <br><br>  At the same time, it is reasonable to believe that after some time they will take over part of the 3d Cart clients. <br><br>  Look at a more mainstream example of a company that used customer feedback to outperform the competition.  In most cases, these were real consumer reviews of the well-known ‚ÄúGet a MacBook‚Äù campaign, which increased distribution of Apple products to the market by 42% in the first year of operation. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZSBWbnmGrE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjU-sGXQP6J4ZYJEzRJ4BSmNu32VA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Perhaps this is the most important element of any build-up from competitors in your campaigns.  No need to try to defeat a competitor in a rude way, you need to do it with taste. <br><br>  Groove does it very intelligently right on the main page of its site, calling itself "A Simple Alternative to Zendesk."  Perhaps that is why many <a href="http://www.zendesk.com/">Zendesk</a> users have switched to them, evaluating the feedback cycle that they offered to their first customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe1/296/0f0/fe12960f0962479b9cf6eb2337f4abd5.jpg"><br><br>  If you are not ready to talk about your competitors on the main page, you can visually emphasize your advantages in comparison with them using a sign somewhere in the depth of the site. <br><br>  Here‚Äôs how <a href="https://www.sugarsync.com/">SugarSync</a> does it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ff/d10/833/9ffd10833af244bca88039c97ecd886a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br><br>  How can we appreciate the importance of competitor research? <br><br>  According to the results of the Marketing Sherpa &amp; Millward Brown survey, spying on competitors is not popular among marketers, but <a href="http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/Accenture-Global-Consumer-Pulse-Research-Study-2013-Key-Findings.pdf">Accenture estimates that the</a> total annual income from customers who have changed the company is about $ 5.9 trillion. <br><br>  If you show determination and do not be afraid of dirty work, the probability of success is very high. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://conversionxl.com/customers-will-never-buy/%3Fhvid%3D4L08rO">conversionxl.com/customers-will-never-buy/?hvid=4L08rO</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/231773/">https://habr.com/ru/post/231773/</a></p>
