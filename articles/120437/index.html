What can I say, even if large companies in difficult times are the first to cut off the marketing department from financing.  It happens that it is cut off not only from financing.  And, if a large company has a fatty layer in the form of a strong brand and its adherents, who will praise it for some time without the support of the Center, then small businesses have no such advantages.  A startup can not afford to shut up for a second.  Here, as in a fairy tale about a pipe and a jug: as soon as the pipe stops, the berries hide. <br><br>  Even if the company has no money at all, there are always shareware tools.  I call them conditionally free, because you still have to spend some time on PR.  The first thing to spend time on is identifying talented and capable team members. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Writer </h4><br>  Already at the stage of business planning it would be nice to think about the person writing.  This does not mean that it is necessary to introduce the post of a copywriter or a PR manager.  The writing person can be part-time any member of the team.  And even better if it is a guy from the plow.  His main specialty can be any: programmer, designer, president.  It is important that he be a graphomaniac.  Graphomaniac is determined by the presence of a live blog and a small army of admirers of talent. <br><br>  The ideal option is when a business owner writes.  Nobody will write about the case better than the owner.  Look at how the image of VKontakte changed after Pavel Durov began to write.  He writes is not perfect, but even so is a hundred times better than complete silence, when everyone thought that he was a virtual, and the company did not have a human face. <br><br>  To a grabber, it's like writing: an article, a press release, a newsletter, a blog post, tweet.  Grafoman writes easily and quickly.  While the business is small and not noticeable, you can not limit the graphomaniac in the style.  You can not fool head corporate ethics and brand essence.  The fewer approvals, the greater will be the exhaust.  Literacy is probably the only thing to watch out for. <br><br>  Well, if the writer has a sense of humor.  Then there is no price at all. <br><br>  Encourage such abilities.  Allocate time for writing staff.  If you think that paying such a person a premium is expensive, then ask how much 1000 characters cost a medium PR agency, and then make an order to laugh and see what they write to you.  Freelancers have the same situation.  He does not work with you side by side, they do not know your business, they are not aware of all the news, and you will never tell them everything, even with all the desire.  The texts of a professional third-party writer always lose to non-professional texts of a team member. <br><br>  I firmly believe that a good motivated writer in a startup every day increases its capitalization.  A writing partner is one of the best partners.  Appreciate such people. <br><br><h4>  Speaker </h4><br>  I find it difficult to answer what is more important: the speaker or the writer.  But if you have both, you are chocolate.  In our case, the speaker is not an ordinary bubnil with a presentation.  This is a man with oratorical abilities and charisma.  If a writer loves to write, then the speaker loves ... right, to speak.  Here, of course, we do not mean balabol and idleman, but a person who is able to clearly, briefly and clearly present the essence of the issue.  In addition, he loves to be the center of attention, loves when he is listened to. <br><br>  There are even fewer such people than writers.  The case is complicated by the fact that there is no fraud.  If in the case of articles you can sometimes give one person for another, then this is not a ride.  And who is usually eager to listen?  Business owners and top management.  This narrows the range of available candidates.  If there is no speaking top manager at hand, there is only one way out - to pump out who is.  I hope everyone believes that no matter how hopeless a person is, you can make a decent speaker from anyone.  There would be desire and perseverance.  If you do not believe, watch a good movie King's Speech. <br><br>  What to do with the lack of charisma?  I am sure that you can correct this situation if you wish. <br><br>  Marketers love the term "talking head".  I don‚Äôt like him because he tunes in to a primitive approach to the speaker: no matter what, no matter how, if only he says something.  Speaking heads are often called and good speakers, which is not true.  A real speaker with charisma is first and foremost a good actor.  A good speaker is a leader.  The reverse, as a rule, is also true. <br><br>  With a good speaker you can conquer the world.  You can participate in all significant and secondary industry events, and you can hold your own.  You can arrange webinars.  You can release podcasts.  You can give hurricane interviews on radio and television.  Even if some of the above tools are worth something, they definitely become free when you deserve a reputation as a good speaker.  You are beginning to be invited to every first event.  And now there are a lot of events. <br><br>  Do not forget about internal PR: performance in front of a team is also very important.  Who will raise morale and inspire exploits when the whole world is against us?  Leader with oratorical abilities.  We also remember that a good speaker is 50% of a good negotiator.  Imagine how to increase the conversion of presentations to customers and investors? <br><br>  Look at Jobs, Gates, Brin, Zuckerberg.  Are they all good speakers, because they have big companies, or their companies are big, because they are good speakers?  Think about it at your leisure. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120437/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120437/</a></p>
