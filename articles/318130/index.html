The democratization strategy of artificial intelligence </h2><br>  Speaking at Microsoft Ignite 2016 at the end of September, Satya Nadella voiced the ambitious goal that the company set itself: ‚Äú <a href="http://news.microsoft.com/ru-ru/features/demokratizatsiya-iskusstvennogo-intellekta/">Democratization of artificial intelligence</a> ‚Äù.  It is to make AI technology accessible and understandable for everyone. <br><br>  Sathya also shared a unique <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DaEBi4OpXU4Q">case with Uber</a> .  The company has implemented a new technology Real-Time ID Check to improve the safety of drivers and passengers, implemented on the basis of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/">Microsoft Cognitive Services</a> .  Its essence lies in the fact that each driver installs a mobile application that recognizes it using the phone‚Äôs camera and only after successful identification can the driver be able to start work.

      It is worth noting that Microsoft took the first steps towards a new strategy in Russia in early October - the <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/ru-ru/event/skype-translator-russian/">Russian language appeared in the Skype Translator</a> . <br><br>  In the autumn, there were two more news about the largest partnerships in the field of AI: <br><br><ol><li>  Facebook, Amazon, IBM, Google and Microsoft have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/28/facebook-amazon-google-ibm-and-microsoft-come-together-to-create-historic-partnership-on-ai/">announced</a> the emergence of an affiliate program for joint work in the field of the development of artificial intelligence, Partnership on AI. <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://news.microsoft.com/ru-ru/microsoft-ai-research-openai/">Microsoft and OpenAI have become partners</a> .  We remind you that OpenAI is a company engaged in the research of artificial intelligence, and was founded jointly by Ilon Mask, Sam Oltman, Greg Brockman and Ilya Sutskever.  OpenAI also chose Microsoft Azure as its main cloud platform for improving their research, as well as creating new tools and technologies that are only possible in the cloud. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/J7_RDJtkBZ0&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhzmCQdAafBRAqe0dj6bUh7Xfx8yQ"></iframe></li></ol><br>  In mid-December, Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/rudevnews/2016/12/14/artificial-intelligence-available-to-everyone/">shared the</a> first results to achieve its goal: the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/russia/2016/12/14/cortana-skills-kit-cortana-devices-sdk/">announcement of the Cortana Devices SDK</a> , talking bots in Skype, updates to the <a href="https://dev.botframework.com/">Microsoft Bot Framework</a> , partnership with Harman Kardon to create a unique speaker system using AI.
