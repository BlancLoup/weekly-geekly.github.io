This support covers both new aspects of the interface and new technologies.  Let's start with the interface, which has undergone very significant changes.

    <a name="2"></a><h4>  Theme support </h4><br>  Visual Studio 2012 supports the ‚Äúthemes‚Äù paradigm and comes with two themes - Light (Light) and Dark (Dark).  We added to Resharper support for both themes for all our menus, icons, etc., in order to fully harmonize with the Studio. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b15/aea/6f8/b15aea6f87bc45abcaad4e3cedba4972.png"><br><br>  In the new Studio, monochrome icons also appeared, but we in turn received a lot of feedback from users who asked us <strong>not to</strong> convert our icons in this style.  Since visual preferences are subjective, we decided to give users the right to choose: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c7/694/9f7/1c76949f7ade58406930df440cac0cac.png"><br><br>  Thereby, you can choose icons yourself, which will be reflected in various menus, windows, etc., and also as icons for different project elements - types, properties, etc.  You can customize the icons through <strong>ReSharper |</strong>  <strong>Options |</strong>  <strong>General</strong> .  Yes, we have also slightly improved our original icons. <br><br><a name="3"></a><h4>  Asynchronous loading of projects </h4><br>  In VS2012, Microsoft added support for asynchronous project loading (ASL), which allows projects in the solution to load independently when opened.  This actually allows the user to begin work before the entire solution is loaded. <br><br>  In the 7th Resharper, despite a number of difficulties that we faced in working with ASL and the corresponding API, we managed to implement full support for this feature - so now you can immediately get a faster loading of projects and all the working capabilities of Resharper. <br><br>  As an example of increasing productivity, a solution containing more than 300 projects when opened with Visual Studio 2010 &amp; ReSharper 6 takes 5 minutes.  12 sec., And with Visual Studio &amp; ReSharper 7 - only 1 min.  17 sec <br><br><a name="4"></a><h4>  Quick launch </h4><br>  In VS2012, if you don‚Äôt know exactly where an element or command is located, you can use the Quick Launch toolbar to instantly search.  Being a Studio plugin, we were able to add our own commands to this menu.  Now, if you type <em>Go to</em> in the panel, QuickLaunch will give you all the relevant Resharper commands: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/090/26a/8ae/09026a8ae847a3603bc90053d8e2d622.png"><br><br><a name="5"></a><h4>  Preview tab </h4><br>  Another new feature of VS2012 is the ‚Äúpreview tab‚Äù.  Its essence is that, unlike the usual tag for a document, this tag opens on the right side of the window, but as soon as you start editing it, it moves to the left side.  The meaning of this teb is to show a fixed browser on which you can navigate without spawning new open tebs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/199/dda/6e7/199dda6e78c6054706f9ee6f899181ed.png"><br><br>  Resharper supports the use of this special tag in features such as <strong>Go To Type / Member / File / Declaration</strong> as well as in <strong>Find Usages</strong> and its associated windows. <br><br><a name="6"></a><h4>  Solution Explorer </h4><br>  In a new solution browser, you can open a specific file and see its structure ‚Äî classes, methods, and so on.  Resharper, in turn, provides a context menu for these elements, so that they can be refactored, find usages, and other usual commands - both through the use of pop-up menus and through keyboard shortcuts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/43b/e6b/546/43be6b54640036670cea897b04ab5d05.png"><br><br><a name="7"></a><h4>  Architecture explorer </h4><br>  In Ultimate edition, VS2012 comes with an architecture browser (Architecture Explorer), which allows you to progressively deepen a solution from namespaces to specific fields or methods.  And here Resharper provides the same support for contextual actions on code elements using the <strong>Navigate To</strong> or <strong>Refactor This</strong> pop-up menus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae7/740/5ef/ae77405eff3e97ae046025067dc1f2b6.png"><br><br><a name="8"></a><h4>  Dependency graph </h4><br>  In addition to supporting Architecture Explorer, Resharper also provides the same capabilities in the dependency graph that Studio can generate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26c/799/ab2/26c799ab2f3fb583e58ac08bf7ca17ba.png"><br><br><a name="9"></a><h2>  <font color="#7E255B">Windows runtime</font> </h2><br>  The upcoming releases of Windows 8 and Visual Studio 2012 give us a new software model for writing applications called Windows Runtime (or WinRT for short).  Since the development on WinRT can be carried out using languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat Resharper already supports (C #, VB.NET, JavaScript), we have added WinRT support to Resharper. <br><br><a name="10"></a><h4>  C #, VB.NET and XAML </h4><br>  Resharper continues to develop support for C # / VB.NET and XAML.  The following features were made specifically for WinRT: <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Code</strong> completion is provided in both code and XAML files.  In XAML, Resharper is familiar with the new namespaces and formats, and is able to provide the necessary add-on options depending on the editing context: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0bf/c40/8a0/0bfc408a069ee4bf222b7cafa63bb6af.png"><br><br></li><li> <strong>Inspections</strong> continue to provide relevant information about possible problems with code in WinRT-specific projects: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db0/598/84a/db059884a7cefc33a1b41485e5ad77c0.png"><br><br></li><li>  <strong>Error correction</strong> (quick-fixes) also helps to quickly fix problems: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a0/0f2/6b8/8a00f26b87171300b1e258b064d705e6.png"><br><br></li><li>  <strong>Contextual navigation</strong> allows you to quickly move around the solution.  This mechanism is aware of the specifics of WinRT projects such as resource naming options: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c7/46f/10c/3c746f10cfc43823193acc167a11fc4f.png"><br><br></li><li>  Reference optimization is also supported in C # / VB.NET-oriented WinRT projects: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cac/4e4/760/cac4e4760251f3a712242fe572753d17.png"><br><br></li></ul><br><a name="11"></a><h4>  Javascript </h4><br>  Unlike C # / VB.NET WinRT projects that inherited the development model from WPF and Silverlight, the WinRT development model using JavaScript (also known as WinJS) is completely different.  Nevertheless, Resharper provides many different features to support it: <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Code completion is</strong> supported in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and even in JSON attributes inside HTML: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b7/3fc/c79/8b73fcc79457a1b1350cc3308ec771b7.png"><br><br></li><li>  Auto-completion is also available for <strong>imported WinRT components</strong> .  For example, here is a class <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e3b/54c/57d/e3b54c57d9a24eced87d3ae6876c709c.png"><br>  being imported into javascript allows Resharper to issue the following autocompletion list: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3db/24d/0d2/3db24d0d237a56a3ab3d0863a07cc661.png"><br><br></li><li> Of course, <strong>navigation</strong> and <strong>search</strong> work fine with WinRT projects.  If we take the example above and look for using the <code>Person</code> class in a C # project, we will get a link to the WinJS project: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/45b/a4c/65d/45ba4c65daee19cf3cded38eff170242.png"><br><br></li><li>  The <strong>create from usage</strong> mechanism (creating code elements from examples of their use) also works in cross-project scenarios.  For example, if you create a new property for an imported WinRT component: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e3/9bb/a89/5e39bba89d5b5bc92cf732f7788088ae.png"><br>  it will be automatically created in the definition of this component: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/177/73c/a6a/17773ca6ac6ae0146037e6bfb6b50787.png"><br><br></li><li>  <strong>Refactoring</strong> (such as <strong>Rename</strong> , for example) also works in cross-project scenarios.  For example, an attempt to rename the property name projected from WinRT components into WinJS will open the dialog to rename the original property: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7bb/19e/f5c/7bb19ef5ca4b50d8497b93f7c60e56d3.png"><br>  Accordingly, after this change, in the C # project the property name will become <code>FullName</code> , and in the projected component - <code>fullName</code> . <br><br></li></ul><br>  Well, as you might guess, most of the existing features for supporting C #, VB.NET, XAML, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript remain accessible to anyone who plans to work with projects based on WinRT. <br><br><a name="12"></a><h2>  <font color="#7E255B">Code Generation</font> </h2><br>  If there was a competition between different subsystems of Resharper about who introduces more changes and a minimum of effort, the Generate mechanism would be the undisputed winner.  And, of course, in the new Resharper, we added several new features and improvements to this mechanism. <br><br><a name="13"></a><h4>  Partial method generation </h4><br>  Many code generation frameworks produce code consisting of <code>partial</code> classes so that users can later change or supplement the behavior of the generated components.  For example, the Entity Framework does this by defining entity classes as <code>partial</code> . <br><br>  Now Resharper supports this usage scenario and allows you to generate partial method signatures.  To do this, you just need to create a <code>partial</code> type and call <strong>Generate |</strong>  <strong>Partial Methods</strong> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a8f/fd8/970/a8ffd8970529a24668b7bb1aa106bd0e.png"><br><br>  Now you just need to choose the methods you want to implement: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/09c/d6a/2e9/09cd6a2e9b984f56b45ad6b5ddce2073.png"><br><br>  ... and all selected methods will be added to the selected class: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69e/118/319/69e1183195037986d9dfa5c2b0d71a91.png"><br><br><a name="14"></a><h4>  Improvements in Generate Equality Members </h4><br>  When comparing types, many of our users wanted to regulate the mechanisms by which type comparisons are made.  Therefore, we added three different type comparison options to the <strong>Generate Equality Members</strong> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e80/18a/f5a/e8018af5a96897151e8a96cb0fbcf09c.png"><br><br>  Depending on which option you choose, the condition that checks the type match in the <code>Equals()</code> method can be implemented in one of the following ways: <br><br><ul><li>  The type must be the same as <code>this</code> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b8c/a03/98b/b8ca0398bebcfec275ed240387109e2d.png"><br><br></li><li>  The type must be the same as the class type: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a16/913/964/a1691396483833c74661eafb6ac44830.png"><br><br></li><li>  The type must be a type or a class heir: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ced/c9e/421/cedc9e4217c8646951d4bdde29f0f0f9.png"><br><br></li></ul><br><a name="15"></a><h4>  Generate Equality Comparer </h4><br>  In addition to the inline comparison implementation for a specific class, the new Resharper comes with a new generator called <strong>Generate Equality Comparer</strong> .  The purpose of this generator is to create a <em>separate</em> class that implements the <code>IEqualityComparer&lt;T&gt;</code> interface.  This is necessary for the implementation of specific comparison criteria, as well as in cases where this interface requires a specific API, with which you work. <br><br>  Here is a small example.  Suppose that we have a class <code>Person</code> in which two properties.  We call the action: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/370/155/da9/370155da91a5cd26075ff9ad1c0d914d.png"><br><br>  ... and by selecting the elements for which we want to make a comparison, <code>Person</code> will receive the following generated private nested class: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57e/207/6ba/57e2076bafac2c27e1570e35835c9457.png"><br><br>  In addition to this, there is an option to generate a nested static instance of this class as a field: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ff/491/087/0ff4910878fd535638f43a98ed38a26e.png"><br><br><a name="16"></a><h4>  INotifyPropertyChanged support </h4><br>  If your class implements <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> or inherits from a class that uses this mechanism (for example, <code>NotificationObject</code> from the Prism framework), then the <strong>Generate Properties</strong> action will offer you various options for implementing properties based on this interface: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e6/308/e2c/5e6308e2c8e18465ec27d3210ea42809.png"><br><br><a name="17"></a><h2>  <font color="#7E255B">INotifyPropertyChanged</font> </h2><br>  Since the days of Windows Forms, the <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> interface has <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> used to let properties report changes to everyone they need (usually a UI).  The support for change notifications, which is used today in many platforms (WPF, Silverlight) and frameworks, we were very often asked to do and in the new release, we did it. <br><br><a name="18"></a><h4>  Automatic implementation </h4><br>  As soon as you add the <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> declaration to your class, the Resharper will offer you a quick fix to implement this interface: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b4/dd9/3cc/8b4dd93ccb76410a16982805b25e8dd0.png"><br><br>  By applying this fix, you will automatically receive not only the declaration of the event, but also the method that facilitates the triggering of this event.  Now you can take any property (be it auto-property or a property with a field) and apply a context action to it, which will add a call to the notification method: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a8/380/304/8a8380304b8f013c716cf0efa8395edb.png"><br><br>  If you use fields instead of properties, you can also use the <strong>Generate Properties</strong> command and Resharper will prompt you to implement notifications on the generated properties: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ec/f41/119/2ecf411198639b1e4e4b5e9715dd0c44.png"><br><br><a name="19"></a><h4>  ID Tracking </h4><br>  Linking a property through a string is not the safest solution.  But if you need to do this, then Resharper will help you.  First, it will track the names of the properties, so if you make a mistake or refer, for example, to a private property, Reshres will immediately highlight the error: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/188/74c/995/18874c99544b8ca23fe088431039829c.png"><br><br>  Secondly, if you decide somewhere to call the notification method manually, you will be presented with autocompletion in the line with the names of possible properties: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5dc/953/12f/5dc95312f32414b15d241810a5e722ce.png"><br><br><a name="20"></a><h4>  Support for various frameworks </h4><br>  There are many different implementations of <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> .  Third-party libraries often use their own method for notifications, and come with base classes from which to inherit.  One of the main differences is that many frameworks use lambda expression instead of a string literal to transfer the name of a method. <br><br>  Resharper comes with support for the following frameworks: <br><br><ul><li>  MVVM Light (WPF 3 and 4; Silverlight 3, 4 and 5; Windows Phone 7 and 7.1) <br></li><li>  Caliburn.Micro (WPF 3 and 4; Silverlight 4 and 5; Windows Phone 7.1) <br></li><li>  Prism (WPF 4; Silverlight 4) <br></li><li>  Catel (WPF 3 and 4) <br></li><li>  MVVMHelpers (WPF 3 and 4, only lambda expressions are supported) <br></li></ul><br>  In practice, this means that if you, for example, inherit from the <code>NotificationObject</code> type from the Prism framework, when you create properties, you will be offered the choice of <code>RaisePropertyChanged</code> method that you want to call: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cfc/98c/294/cfc98c2941e4483edc4a8ab79dffff09.png"><br><br>  If you choose the lyabmda-oriented option, then your properties will look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/016/a9d/49c/016a9d49cca87710ea1aaff736e632cc.png"><br><br>  And, of course, the same implementations will be presented in the context menus: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/854/1ce/291/8541ce291fd108c4a8289d5daedb0ddb.png"><br><br><a name="29"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#7E255B">New refactorings</font> </h2><br>  Resharper already has a reputation for a tool that helps to manage complexity well, and in the 7th release we are pleased to introduce two new refactoring, created to simplify the task of managing large amounts of code. <br><br><a name="30"></a><br><h4>  Extract Class </h4><br>  What do you do if in your code the class grows to uncontrollable sizes?  Most likely, you are trying to break the class is not a few classes smaller.  In order to simplify this operation, we have added refactoring called <strong>Extract Class</strong> .  The essence of this refactoring is simple: you choose which class members you need to ‚Äúpull out‚Äù, decide what to do with various access problems (if any), and ReSharper does the work for you to create a new class. <br><br>  Let's imagine that we have a <code>Person</code> class that has too many address fields that it would be good to put into a separate class: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a4/8b4/88e/7a48b488e3dfb435bb1cb69518c22d7b.png"><br><br>  To provide a separate class for different address properties, we can call refactoring both from the context menu and, for example, from the new Solution Explorer.  All you need is to select the desired properties and use the <strong>Refactor This</strong> menu: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ffa/d88/b07/ffad88b0771faa9f159bcb6a9b1cbce3.png"><br><br>  A dialog box will appear in which you can select those elements that you want to extract (neologism?) And also give a name to the new class and the variable that will contain the instance of this class in its ‚Äúparent‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/804/4a8/ee6/8044a8ee6c8213f38439cafbb9c64651.png"><br><br>  Refactoring also provides several options on how to access the pulled out property: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/21f/794/b81/21f794b813058df3758ddc08bc25a872.png"><br><br>  Options are as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>None</strong> means that the class member will be accessible only through a new variable. <br><br></li><li>  <strong>Create copy</strong> will create in the original class an exact copy of the member you dragged into the new class.  If some part of the code uses this variable, it continues to use the <em>original</em> , and not something that was pulled out. <br><br></li><li>  <strong>The</strong> create <strong>delegating wrapper</strong> creates a delegating wrapper around the pulled out element.  In other words, all calls are forwarded, for example: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b2/0d3/b3a/2b20d3b3a66dbd7bd40491dc280700c2.png"><br><br></li></ul><br>  In addition, the Extract Class dialog box vividly illustrates all possible accessibility issues for items that will arise when a new class is pulled out.  For each item selected in the list, Resharper will show all other items that use it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d6/e58/14a/5d6e5814a21095b2b76f3f35d708da1d.png"><br><br>  And in a similar manner, when you select the check-box of the element that you want to put in a separate class, Resharper will show all other elements that will also be made in order to preserve the correctness of execution.  For example, when you try to render a <code>PrintCity()</code> method, you will see the following: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b49/a15/63c/b49a1563cac2b7d8601aca5c3fe31099.png"><br><br>  ... and get the following code: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df1/e7d/2f5/df1e7d2f5eccb04970714529fb1009c5.png"><br><br>  Finally, there will be situations where you have a full-fledged conflict of use: for example, trying to pull out a <code>private</code> property that is still used in the original class.  In this case, Resharper will show you the Stop icon and offer several options for resolving this problem: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d6/da7/2da/0d6da72da1df38debeece79f40deff60.png"><br><br>  Variants of possible fixes are: <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Make public</strong> simply makes the element public. <br><br></li><li>  <strong>Create accessor</strong> leaves the element ‚Äúas is‚Äù but makes it a public proxy element so that the original class can still reach this element. <br><br></li><li>  <strong>Do not apply fix</strong> does nothing, thus you will have non-compiled code. <br><br></li></ul><br>  <strong>Please note</strong> that at the moment refactoring only supports C #.  VB.NET support will probably appear in one of the future versions of Resharper. <br><br><a name="31"></a><br><h4>  Transform Out Parameters </h4><br>  We all had a situation in which we started working with a method that had one return value, and then we wanted to add one more.  A typical solution to this problem is to add <code>out</code> parameters, for example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13e/6b6/8c3/13e6b68c34f880287783be36ba56cd9f.png"><br><br>  As an alternative to the approach above, you can use the return type <code>Tuple&lt;Person,bool</code> &gt; and <strong>Transform Out Parameters</strong> and this is the approach that implements.  Simply call this refactoring on the <code>out</code> parameter ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebb/b7b/86e/ebbb7b86e121b516ad1a63f6c558d55b.png"><br><br>  ... and you will get a dialog box that will show you all the existing <code>out</code> parameters, and will let you choose the ones you want to translate into a tuple: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/011/136/e44/011136e44ba476be2df44259008c834e.png"><br><br>  After applying refactoring, we will have a method in which there is no longer <code>out</code> parameter, and which returns a tuple.  Internal use of parameters will be rewritten accordingly: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17c/0d8/2b7/17c0d82b75897f45189ed1e3d83e5545.png"><br><br>  This refactoring is available for C # and VB.NET languages.  Since the <code>Tuple</code> class is used here, refactoring is mainly applied to projects on .NET Framework 4 and higher, although in the case of a single <code>out</code> parameter in the <code>void</code> method, refactoring will allow you to translate this parameter into a return value. <br><br>  And finally, I want to note that if you <em>already</em> return a tuple as a return value, this refactoring will allow you to extend this tuple based on <code>out</code> parameters. <br><br><a name="21"></a><h2>  <font color="#7E255B">Unit testing</font> </h2><br>  The mechanism for running unit tests Resharper has become a familiar part of the toolkit for many developers.  The ability to run and debug tests from anywhere in the code, coupled with an integrated test launch mechanism, makes the test run process convenient and intuitive, and the presence of a large number of third-party plug-ins makes it possible to use many popular test frameworks. <br><br>  Here is a brief overview of new testing features in the 7th Resharper. <br><br><a name="22"></a><h4>  Jasmine </h4><br>  In the previous version of Resharper, we did support the QUnit test framework.  In the same release, we added support for <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/" title="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> - a BDD framework for testing JavaScript. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/050/969/8b5/0509698b54e9af82315f09c4981b717e.png"><br><br>  As elsewhere, the test results of Jasmine fall into the test run window: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3de/c9f/126/3dec9f12660501e1d0993433de5c0cd4.png"><br><br><a name="23"></a><h4>  PhantomJS </h4><br>  In addition to the ability to perform tests in the browser, ReSharper 7 offers users an alternative mechanism: the ability to use <a href="http://phantomjs.org/" title="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a> - a console interface to the WebKit engine - to perform tests.  To start using it, you just need to open the settings (the <strong>Unit Testing | JavaScript Tests</strong> tab) and specify the path PhantomJS is installed to: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fbb/3de/7a2/fbb3de7a2bc84bcd14f8ff962c5614d6.png"><br><br>  Now all JavaScript executed tests will be executed through PhantomJS, and the browser window will not appear. <br><br><a name="24"></a><h4>  NUnit Improvements </h4><br>  The testing functionality adds support for the <code>TestCaseSource</code> attribute in NUnit.  This attribute allows you to specify the location of test cases for parameterized tests: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/275/0ba/efd/2750baefd0edb480591af747a0084719.png"><br><br>  Since this attribute refers to a variable by name, Resharper also checks this name for validity: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e1/9ef/60b/3e19ef60bdf03bf4dc2b381fe3eb48bb.png"><br><br>  ... and also provides auto completion options: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/856/97b/889/85697b8890a86a3116cc4a3dd804fd57.png"><br><br><a name="25"></a><h4>  Support for other frameworks </h4><br>  If you want to use a test framework that Resharper does not support ‚Äúnatively‚Äù - this is not a problem, since  Many plugin writers provide support for various test frameworks.  To date, frameworks that support Resharper include <a href="http://agunit.codeplex.com/" title="http://agunit.codeplex.com/">AgUnit</a> , <a href="http://gallio.org/" title="http://gallio.org/">Gallio / MbUnit</a> , <a href="https://github.com/machine/machine.specifications" title="https://github.com/machine/machine.specifications">xUnit,</a> and <a href="https://github.com/machine/machine.specifications" title="https://github.com/machine/machine.specifications">MSpec</a> . <br><br><a name="26"></a><h2>  <font color="#7E255B">Support for new languages ‚Äã‚Äãin ReSharper SDK</font> </h2><br>  From the very first release of ReSharper SDK, they ask us how to add support for new languages ‚Äã‚Äãto Resharper.  The possibility of adding such support has always been, but it was not so easy, so in this version we decided to provide users with a complete set of tools for creating lexers and parsers for new languages. <br><br><a name="27"></a><h4>  Instruments </h4><br>  Support for new languages ‚Äã‚Äãin Resharper requires the creation of lexers and parsers for these languages, as well as the subsequent adaptation of these generated structures to the Resharper API.  To simplify this process, we have added a folder in the SDK called <code>Tools</code> , where you can find the following useful tools: <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>CsLex</strong> - a tool for creating lexical analyzers for various languages <br></li><li>  <strong>parserGen</strong> - tool for creating Resharper compatible parsers <br></li><li>  <strong>Java</strong> - this folder contains the IKVM infrastructure, which allows you to run the parser generator (which is itself written in Java) <br></li><li>  <strong>MSBuild</strong> - contains tasks that allow you to automate the creation of parsers and lexers in a project <br></li></ul><br><a name="28"></a><h4>  Examples </h4><br>  One of the tools provided, <strong>parserGen</strong> , uses a special format for defining parsers (PSI files) which themselves use a special language.  Therefore, we decided to kill two birds with one stone at once, putting together with the SDK plugin that supports the language of PSI files.  This allows us to: <br><br><ul><li>  By providing the source code of the plugin to illustrate the process of creating support for a new language <br></li><li>  Provide plugin support for creating new languages <br></li></ul><br><br><h2>  <font color="#7E255B">Conclusion</font> </h2><br>  In addition to the features described above, Resharper 7 also supports: <br><br><ul><li>  SharePoint and LightSwitch Projects <br></li><li>  ASP.NET 4.5 and ASP.NET MVC 4 <br></li><li>  Advanced variable naming settings (useful for those who use different naming schemes for applications and tests). <br></li><li>  ‚Ä¶and much more! <br></li></ul><br><br><hr><br>  You can try ReSharper 7 by downloading the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/index.html" title="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/index.html">distribution with a 30-day free period</a> . <br><br>  Open-source developers can apply <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/buy/buy.jsp" title="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/buy/buy.jsp#openSource">for free licenses</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/buy/buy.jsp" title="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/buy/buy.jsp#classroom">Free</a> educational <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/buy/buy.jsp" title="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/buy/buy.jsp#classroom">licenses</a> can also be obtained by educational institutions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148105/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148105/</a></p>
