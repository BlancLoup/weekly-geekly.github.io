      This is not only the audience (customers who want everything today and for free), but the troupe itself (your programmers who want to try a new toy, do not want to document anything, artists who sleep and see how they draw space), but also members of the troupe‚Äôs families ( husband at home at 17.30 at home and not tired on the way took the child out of the garden). <br><br>  Your work is <b>‚Äúmake everyone a winner‚Äù</b> [Boehm, 1989].  As long as what is expected happens, everyone is happy.  Our CEO, a smart uncle with glasses, constantly says:  He is about customers, you need to think about all the others. <br><br>  Everyone involved in the play has its own interest.  These are either desires or fears.  The desire is to get a quick and nice little app for appstore to some event and check how cool it was.  Desire is an interest to get something, fear is connected with an interest not to allow something. <br><br>  Spectators are too complex creatures to easily identify their fears and desires.  The viewers themselves do not understand them well.  The interests of the audience of the troupe and their family members are too controversial for it to be easy in one play ‚Äúto cram into nevi‚Äù, to put it in the words of the Nivalians.  A good developer is a leader for his customer, in the sense that after talking with him the customer understands what he wants. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Viewers they do not tell you directly what they want or are afraid of.  Instead, they write requirements.  Requirements.  The requirement to ‚Äúuse .net which you do not know‚Äù, or ‚Äúanything but a cartoon‚Äù, what is really behind this?  What happens if you are late for a week, or if you cut the feature off - you‚Äôll run out of a license for Batman, as happened with EA, or you just lose your face.  Is everything related to .net, or did you simply have a negative experience with .net Indians?  Or maybe you are so tired of the same Disney cartoons that you think that no one can change your mind.  When you, going out of the cinema after watching WALL-E, you, like 90% of the audience, do not take it as a cartoon, it will be a work of art that touched your soul.  This is what you want, and not ‚Äújust not a cartoon‚Äù.  You want it to be cool to be interesting.  To make a WALL-E you need something more than Bondarchuk and 36.5 million money.  All this is ‚Äúonly‚Äù a question of open and constant communication with the customer.  Do not tell me that it came up in agile.  This is common sense. <br><br>  Any idea can be brought to the result, the only question is in time.  You can work with any customer.  Too often, we have seen this when valuable items made of shit (gavno-concepts) made decent products.  This, however, does not mean that you need to play for any viewer, to offer everyone your WALL-E.  The choice of customers and ideas should be as carefully as other key aspects of the project.  Not every customer needs to be contacted, have the will to refuse the ‚Äútype of advantageous offer‚Äù, it will be more expensive. <br><br>  It is sad to watch the opposition of the troupe and the audience.  Developers and customers.  "Hollywood is not capable of creating anything worthy, for them there is only money."  Work and family, publisher and developer, all these are not examples of permanent intractable conflicts.  Do not let losers and their examples influence you.  Cynicism is self-defense.  Everyone wants to create his own WALL-E, where everyone is a winner.  As Maslow said, a mature person finds synergy where there is another unsolvable conflict between the customer and the developer.  Let there be an example of Pixar-a and their WALL-E.  Focus on it.  Maybe when the thread, something like that happens. <br><br>  On the one hand, we laugh at ourselves when, for example, Denis Petelin talks about <a href="http://rutube.ru/tracks/1073001.html%3Fv%3D869f5ce5f0f433877d7f6c658246828b">‚Äúcooking boutiques,‚Äù</a> or when Nivalians talk about ‚Äúyubisoft hedgehogs and how they made the 5th heroes‚Äù.  On the other hand, in the young, fragile mind, which still continues to absorb everything, a dangerous thought may arise that this is the norm.  Where a mature person sees ‚Äústrangely, NIVAL has not worked with jubisoft‚Äù, the weaker will see ‚Äúyubisoft kazly‚Äù, or ‚Äúrup sucks‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Make everyone a winner in your play.</b> <br>  To get closer to this, you need to practice a lot and read a lot of books, in the title of which there will be no words RUP, or SCRUM.  The sooner you realize that it‚Äôs time to throw out the MS Project (or what kind of toy you use there instead) and begin to seriously interact with very complex creatures - people, team, customers, users, the better. <br><br>  PS My wife, constantly whining, as she is bad at work.  And although I understand the essence of what is happening, it is incredibly difficult for me not to try to ‚Äúfix the problem‚Äù (I think she wants it), but to give her ‚Äúpsychological oxygen‚Äù, to reduce her stress simply by talking about the problem (what she really wants). <br>  Think, if it is not possible to understand in such seemingly trifles what can happen with your project, if you do not have good contact with your customer, if you do not understand the nature of their desires and fears regarding your project. <br><br>  Any customer is good, <b>"you just do not know how to cook it</b> . <b>"</b> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50745/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50745/</a></p>
