For three quarters of the year, we diligently managed their publication, working with about a hundred global media partners, distributing documentation across their regions of influence, controlling the publishing and editing system around the world, fighting for maximum return for our partners. <br><br>  But due to the gross negligence of the Guardian newspaper - our former partner - a confidential password was published to decrypt all 251 thousand telegrams published in the title of one of the chapters of their book, hastily released in February 2011 [ <em>approx.</em>  <em>This is probably the biographical book " <a href="http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do%3FISBN%3D9780852652398">WIKILEAKS: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy</a> ", which was published by the Guardian Books in 2011. A <a href="https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/">footnote</a> on one of the links <a href="http://archive.is/ylPUp">indicates</a> that this happened because of confusion: the publishers felt that the password was temporary and changed from time to time, but it turned out wrong</em> .]  In mid-August, we discovered that our former German employee ‚Äî whom I had suspended in 2010 ‚Äî began to build connections with various individuals and organizations, trading in his location with encrypted files with a book containing a password.  In terms of the rate of dissemination of this information, we estimate that within two weeks most of the special services, mercenaries and intermediaries will get access to documents.  And the public is not.

      I decided that it was necessary to move our publication schedule and do everything earlier by four months, and also to contact the State Department and give them an early warning.  The situation was complicated by the fact that it could turn into another legislation and other political persecution.  We were unable to connect with Lois Susman (Louis Susman), the then US ambassador to Britain, so we decided to knock on the front door.  WikiLeaks research department editor Sarah Harrison called the State Department's reception desk and told the operator that Julian Assange would like to talk with Hallari Clinton.  Predictably, at first this statement was met with bureaucratic disbelief.  Suddenly, we found ourselves in a situation in which Peter Sellers found himself in that scene of ‚ÄúDoctor Strangelove‚Äù, where he tried to call the White House to warn about an impending nuclear war, and he was left hanging on the phone while waiting.  Just as in the film, we had to go upward, each time talking to a higher-level bureaucrat, until we were finally connected to Ms. Clinton‚Äôs senior legal adviser.  He told us that he would call back.  We hung up and waited. <br><br>  <strong>***</strong> <br><br>  When the telephone rang half an hour later, it was not the State Department on the other end of the line.  It was Joseph Farrell, an American employee at WikiLeaks, who arranged for our recent meeting with Google.  He had just received an email from Lisa Shields asking him to confirm whether the State Department had actually called WikiLeaks. <br><br>  At this point, I finally realized that Eric Schmidt is not the only scout in Google.  Officially or not, he has some kind of company [of people] that allows him to be close to Washington, implying a well-documented relationship with President Obama.  People Hillary Clinton not only knew that Shields, among other partners of Eric Schmidt, visited me, they also chose her to use as a backup channel of communication.  While WikiLeaks was deeply involved in publishing the internal archives of the US Department of State, the US Department of State crept into the WikiLeaks command center and squeezed a free lunch out of me.  Two years later, in 2013, when visits to China, <a href="http://archive.is/bXrQ2">North Korea</a> and Burma began, Eric Schmidt became a truly valuable person as Washington's backstage diplomat.  But at that time it was something new. <br><br>  I came back to this in February 2012, when WikiLeaks ‚Äî along with about thirty media partners ‚Äî began to publish Global Intelligence (global intelligence): internal correspondence from a privately held Texas intelligence agency Stratfor.  One of our strongest analytical partners, the Beirut-based newspaper Al Akhbar, has <a href="http://archive.is/gHMzq">gone through</a> intelligence letters about Jared Cohen.  People from Stratfort, who considered themselves to be a kind of private CIA, were jealous that someone wanted to enter their sector of activity.  Google appeared on their radar.  In a series of colorful letters, they discussed the structure of activity, built by Cohen under the auspices of Google Ideas, suggesting what this actually leads to. <br><br>  Cohen‚Äôs leadership sought to move from public relations and ‚Äúcorporate responsibility‚Äù to active corporate intervention in international affairs, and at a level that is generally acceptable to the state.  Jared Cohen jokingly was called the ‚Äúdirector of regime change.‚Äù  Judging by the information from the letters, he tried to apply his hands to all the major historical events in the modern Middle East.  He <a href="http://archive.is/DCzlA">was</a> in Egypt during the revolution, meeting with Wael Ghonim, a Google employee, whose arrest allowed him to become a media hero and a symbol of the uprising in the Western press and who was caught several hours after the meeting [ <em>Wikipedia Reference: Wael Gonim - Internet -activist and computer engineer.</em>  <em>Since January 2010 - Google Marketing Director in the Middle East and North Africa.</em>  <em>In 2011, he received worldwide fame as an activist of the revolution in Egypt</em> ].  Meetings were also scheduled in Turkey and Palestine, but both were canceled by Google as too dangerous.  Just a few months before the meeting with me, Cohen had planned a trip to the border of Iran and Azerbaijan to attract Iranian communities closer to the border, as part of the Google Ideas project on ‚Äúrepressive communities‚Äù [ <em>approx.</em>  <em>Unfortunately, there is no reference to this in the text, so it‚Äôs not quite clear what the project means</em> .]  In one of the internal emails, Stratford‚Äôs vice-president of intelligence, Fred Burton (Fred Burton, a former US State Department security officer), wrote the following: <br><br><blockquote>  Google gives the White House both support and air cover.  In fact, they are doing things that the CIA is not capable of ... [Cohen] someday be kidnapped or killed.  Perhaps it is even the best that can happen to expose Google‚Äôs hidden role in shaping the uprisings.  In this case, the US government will be able to pretend that it knows nothing, but Google will remain with a bag of shit ( <em>‚Äúand Google is left holding the shit-bag‚Äù</em> ). <br></blockquote><br>  In further internal correspondence, Burton <a href="http://archive.is/IoFw4">points out</a> Cohen Marty Lev (Marty Lev), Google‚Äôs director of security and safety, and Eric Schmidt himself as his informants.  Looking for something more specific, I began to bring up the WikiLeaks archives with information about Cohen.  In the diplomatic telegrams that we published, I managed to find that Cohen <a href="http://archive.is/loAlC">started</a> in 2009, in Afghanistan, trying to convince the four local largest telecom operators to move their antennas to US military bases.  In Lebanon, he quietly <a href="http://archive.is/34MyI">worked</a> on the creation of Hezbola‚Äôs intellectual and spiritual rival, the <em>‚ÄúHigher Shia League‚Äù</em> .  And in London, he <a href="http://archive.is/mxXGQ">agreed</a> with representatives of Bollywood to insert anti-extremist content into their films, promising to establish links with them for Hollywood. <br><br>  Three days later, Jared Cohen visited me at <a href="">Ellingham Hall</a> <em>.</em>  <em>farm in South Norfolk, UK</em> ].  He flew to Ireland on SAVE (Summit Against Violent Extremism, Summit Against Violent Extremism), an event co-sponsored by Google Ideas and the American Council on Foreign Relations.  Gang members from poor areas, right-wing fighters, militant nationalists and "religious extremists" - all these guys were gathered in one place for a workshop on technological solutions to the problems of "violent extremism."
