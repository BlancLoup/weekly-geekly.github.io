However, by chance, he drove to his elder brother in NN and decided to radically change his plans.  About this below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7e/vo/pc/7evopcrrsd3hv2ydaxb0nss7nne.jpeg"><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h3>  General stereotype </h3><br>  There is an opinion that if you want to engage in IT normally, then you need to either get out of the Russian Federation or go to Moscow (well, either to St. Petersburg, if you're really poor).  And indeed, if you open the same hh.ru/habr - all the diversity of it-vacancies, the fattest it-vacancies, all it-dvizhuha goes exactly in these cities.  But, about what they usually forget, there is wild competition among specialists, there is a wild pace of life, there are large overhead costs. <br><br>  Those.  conditionally coming to "conquer Moscow", you will be obliged to settle in some kind of klopovnik, spend a couple of hours on the way to work, and so enjoy all the charms of the bizi-life.  Whether you become a highly paid specialist who can move from the Klopovnik to a normal place is a big question that many people cannot solve for years. <br>  On the other hand, you can initially choose a normal place where you can work and live without tension.  And the general European trend is just striving for such a model of life. <br><br><h3>  What is Nizhny Novgorod </h3><br>  Nizhny Novgorod is the third largest city in the European part of Russia, one of the largest industrial and scientific centers of Russia.  In the USSR, the city was exclusively industrial, which affected the lives of its people, but now life is becoming more open, free and cultural - in general, like in healthy people. <br><br>  <b>Gorgeous place.</b>  If you do not take into account the city with a unique natural feature, such as Vladivostok, Sevastopol, Sochi, Nizhny Novgorod is built on a beautiful place - the confluence of the Oka and Volga rivers, to which the upper hilly and lower flat parts are added.  There is something to catch the eye. <br><br>  <b>Historical Center.</b>  The city has a large number of old buildings and the famous Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.  Considering the fact that during the war the Germans did not reach the city, then everything is in a more or less adequate form (not as licked as in Petersburg, of course, but quite normal). <br><br>  <b>People.</b>  If in Moscow, it quickly becomes evident that people represent different nationalities, with a different outlook on life, then in Nizhny Novgorod most of the people are Russians.  Due to this, the overall situation is quite calm, except for places where people drink after work (but again they mostly drink beer). <br><br>  <b>Scientific base.</b>  In the city there are two vigorous universities, which prepare adequate developers.  Plus, local companies work with universities, which helps young professionals to find work after graduation. <br><br>  <b>Proximity to Moscow.</b>  The city is relatively close to Moscow (3-4 hours on a trip, 1 hour by plane), so you can go to Moscow in the morning for some business and come back in the evening.  I want to note that if the conditional Klin, Zelenograd, Balashikha are the minions of Moscow, where people spend the night exclusively and go to Moscow for work, then Nizhny Novgorod is an independent city with its own life. <br><br>  <b>Climate of Nizhny Novgorod.</b>  The climate is very similar to Moscow.  Perhaps only in the autumn and winter is slightly colder due to the wind that rises from behind the rivers. <br><br>  <b>The property.</b>  I will give my example - I bought an apartment in the upper part of the city, a two-bedroom apartment for 3.4 million.  This is a very reasonable price. <br><br><h3>  IT-market of Nizhny Novgorod </h3><br>  A general analysis of the market can be found in the article - <a href="https://habr.com/post/327838/">habr.com/post/327838</a> , but I will <a href="https://habr.com/post/327838/">provide</a> theses. <br><br><ul><li>  The general list of vacancies in the city is much smaller than in Moscow or St. Petersburg, but it is quite consistent with the population of the city.  Those.  Moscow has 14 million people, Nizhny Novgorod - 1.2, and in total the number of vacancies in NN is 14 times less than in the MSC.  Same with the comparison with the SPB.  Those.  viable situation. </li><li>  The city has a huge number of body-shops that take on outsourcing tasks.  Therefore, the total number of vacancies in the java / .net / qa-automation stack is several times larger than the trendy youth php / python / node.js.  This is the most important feature of the city. </li><li>  Local companies suffer from the fact that part of the landowners goes to Moscow for fat contracts, so they quite willingly offer adequate conditions for the RFP.  Taking into account the cost of services in the city and the absence of varicose expansion of the venous plexus of the rectum due to transport - it turns out even more profitable than in Moscow. </li><li>  Many companies work with foreign customers, so getting some kind of business trip to the USA, Germany, England is quite simple. </li><li>  Beginner programmers begin to hunt for 40-50k.  On average, the salary of senior - 120-140 thousand.  Which is quite adequate. </li></ul><br><br>  You can also note the technopark, which allows you to become a resident and get state support for your startup.  There is no particular benefit from this yet, but it's still nice. <br><br><h3>  General opinion </h3><br>  Nizhny Novgorod is a great place to live if you want to live and not bathe.  The local market provides an adequate number of vacancies for quite interesting projects.  Therefore, if you want to move on it-specialty, but do not want to get hemorrhagic "big city", consider the option with Nizhny Novgorod. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428455/">https://habr.com/ru/post/428455/</a></p>
