Start!</b> <br>  Well ... about the launch ... then yes ... Chrome noticeably wins all the browsers installed on my computer.  The reason may lie in the fact that on Firefox 3.0.5 there are too many different plug-ins both needed and not needed, which they never even used ... and the fact that my girlfriend uses Operoy ... and I don‚Äôt know what happened to him and in what condition is it to explain the reason for the Opera lag.  Well, I won‚Äôt talk about IE7 ... although it‚Äôs not that bulky as many people say. <br><br>  <b>2. Nous ... poyuzat ...</b> <br>  We proceed to my favorite chat: <a href="http://www.realchat.ru/">www.realchat.ru</a> <br>  Although the developers claim that the chat engine is designed only for work with IE6 or higher, but for the purity of the experiments, we will try to use the chat for all browsers.  And what we see: <br>  Normally, the chat has opened, the normal menu opens when you click on the nick with the right mouse button and the sound is played when messages arrive only in IE7. <br>  Opera fell right away ... it's not possible to work normally in chat. <br>  Firefox works with chat, but the menu does not open on the nickname ... and you have problems with writing the message ... you click on the nickname ... and the cursor does not move the line to enter text. <br>  Chrome showed itself on the better side ... although the sound does not play - nothing blooms.  And something is crookedly updated with the main window along with the line for writing the message, but as a whole in it you CAN work in the chat.

      We try Yandex ... <br>  Ha ... the result is better than expected ... only the mail failed ... namely: <br>  on the right side of the screen (where to remove, move, etc.) this panel is ... a little lower than other browsers, which hurt the eyes a little ... the rest is still at its best ... when working with other services of Russian Google (as I have daring to call Yandex) there are no problems ... including Yandex. Photos ... just you don‚Äôt search for the mass uploader ... well, ok ... there are other browsers (IE7 and FF) <br><br>  Trying Google ... <br>  Well, there are no questions at all ... like a fish in water ... everything is on top!  no delays ... everything is convenient and without glitches.  But this was understandable, because the parent cannot make a ‚Äúchild‚Äù who would not understand the ancestor itself. <br><br>  <b>3. And what's next ...</b> <br>  And now what are the EXPRESS "-" new Chrome? <br>  Well, the first thing that comes to mind is the absence of any plug-ins.  I'm very used to my FF, when I have a girlfriend and a bar from Yandex and Google ... you can quickly and efficiently go to the mail and to the reader ... and you can see traffic jams)))) in Chrome, alas, there is no such thing ... we think so far ... <br>  Does not fold to tray ... i.e.  At work, it will not be possible to quickly minimize the browser so that it does not interfere in the taskbar. <br>  There is no version for Linux ... and in Ubuntu we use the same FF. <br>  At the expense of the load on the memory ... I can not say that I am very annoyed by something ... the benefit of memory 4gig saves ... but at work in a laptop with 2gigs neither Firefox nor Opera strains. <br>  Style ... style ... what can I say ... in general, I liked the design and colors in the program. <br><br>  <b>4. Verdict</b> <br>  According to the results of my ridiculous in one respect test of the new browser from Google, I want to note that even though the program is quite young and where it is not yet finalized and damp.  There are no plug-ins and browser add-ons we are used to, but you can work quite well with them. <br>  So for those who love everything new and innovative, download Chrome and use your health ... Google will hopefully add the rest of the ‚Äúmissing‚Äù components to the browser. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48410/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48410/</a></p>
