  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Opera Mobile 10.1 for Symbian in the final</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/bbc_tabs.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  Do you know that if you take 110 models of the most popular mobile phones in Russia, 100 of them will be Nokia brand, 5 belong to Sony Ericsson, 2 will be produced by Samsung, 2 - by LG and only 1 will be made by Apple?  However, today's news will be of interest to the owners not of mobile phones, but smartphones.  True - not all, but only working under the control of Symbian ^ 3 and Symbian S60 of the third or fifth edition.  In other words - Nokia's smartphones.  So, now I understand why I started the news with such statistics.  Yes, Nokia is loved by us, and I hope they will love even more if all smartphones of a famous Finnish manufacturer have a new version of Opera Mobile 10.1 browser installed, the final release of which has been released to people today.  However, whether it will be installed depends on the owners of the above smartphones themselves, so I‚Äôll try to present the new browser in the best light. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/website.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  So, Opera Mobile for Symbian.  What is he so good that right now you need to postpone all the work and set it on your pocket friend of Finnish origin?  First of all - the browser is made in Opera Software.  In Norway.  It is very close to Finland, within reach.  Often both of these powers are called in one word - Scandinavia.  This means that their inhabitants, and, consequently, everything that they do with their skillful hands, have common features.  Here and inherent to the northern peoples conciseness, and Scandinavian reliability, and much more.  But!  There are differences.  What associations arise at the mention of the two words ‚ÄúFinland‚Äù and ‚Äúspeed‚Äù?  That's right - the word antonyms.  Google does not give any clues when entering this phrase in the search bar, and that says something.  Opera browser is not made in Finland, so it is fast.  Extremely fast. <br><br>  The secret of Opera‚Äôs speed is not only that the browser uses the latest stable version of the engine, in addition to this, it finally received a new JavaScript handler called Carakan, which uses JIT compilation.  As a result, according to the results of unbiased tests carried out under the strictest secrecy in the basements of our company, version 10.1 was 9 times faster than the previous 10.0 on the SunSpider JavaScript tests.  By the way, I don‚Äôt want to say anything bad about Finnish browsers, but the staff member of this program family, who was on the device under test, could not even pass this terrible test.  However, it‚Äôs still not a fact that Finnish programmers made this browser. <br><br>  In general, in terms of speed, it was possible to stop at this, but everything is not so simple: the Norwegian programmers decided to leave in the browser a function better known as Turbo.  When you turn it on, Opera starts loading pages up to seven more times!  The speed is so high that the user does not even have time to read the text on one page, as the next one immediately loads.  Fortunately, it was decided to only partially activate the hardware acceleration in the browser - on internal tests with full acceleration, the testers were blown off by hats.

      But enough about speed.  After all, in Opera Mobile there are other advantages.  For example - ease of use.  There is a complete set of functions - Express panel for quick access to your favorite websites in one click, visual tab switching, data synchronization with other versions of Opera browsers, smooth zoom, kinetic scrolling, virtual keyboard.  In my opinion, it is easier to say what is not in it, than to list everything that is available out of the box.  Yes - and such a nice little thing, like automatic switching to landscape view when you turn your smartphone in your hand. <br><br><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/landscape_fullscreen.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I think all of the above is already enough to install Opera Mobile and forget about all the other programs trying to pretend to be a mobile browser. <img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/geolocation.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  But I have not said a word about the support of geolocation.  Of course, there are not so many services on the Internet that use this technology, but in RuNet this is a problem.  So what?  Nobody uses the teletext function at all, but TV sets with teletext are better than without it.  Ask any sales assistant in the salon of home appliances.  IPhone, by the way, also supports geolocation - did you see which lines were behind it on the day they arrived at the store shelves?  So geolocation is a necessary thing in the household, let it be. <br><br>  And one moment.  I understand that for those who buy smartphones, money is not a question at all.  But just in case, let me remind you that you can use Opera Mobile browser for free.  As, however, and all other browsers Opera.  We do not ask for money for downloading either, so welcome to the <a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile/">official website</a> (beware of fakes!). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108781/</a></p>
