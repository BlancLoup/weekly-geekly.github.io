      I had a dream to work in Pixar as soon as I learned about its existence. <br><br>  Of course, ‚Äúthen,‚Äù I still did not understand what it means to ‚Äúwork for a foreign company, if you are a person with our mentality.‚Äù  But, honestly, I still know about it only by hearsay.  But the dream is a dream, and I had to live with it.  True, it was not long to suffer - the dream came true.  And, as always, it was accomplished in exactly the way that you least suspect. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One day I was a little tired of researching new composite materials, and I went to interviews.  Went for long.  I agreed to work on the first one.  As I remember, at first I showed my works, and then they told me that we, i.e.  They make a cartoon and showed the trailer.  I also remember very well how I thought: ‚ÄúSho for garbage?‚Äù.  But he agreed to work - because the cartoon had to be corrected and, apparently, only I knew it. <br><br>  Not that the graphics were bad, or the animation was useless - no, everything was rendered and animated perfectly.  But the watch itself was sooooo tedious to watch. <br><br>  After a short talk about money, I rushed home happy to please the family.  As always, the euphoria of the salary amount went away as soon as I got out of the elevator.  My thoughts began to break in my head: ‚ÄúI should have asked for more,‚Äù ‚ÄúSomething I completely sold off‚Äù, ‚ÄúSomehow they suspiciously quickly agreed on my amount,‚Äù etc. <br><br>  I went to work in a day, as agreed.  Then I still did not suspect that the cartoon, which I will do, is full-length, and with an eye to the world premiere as well. <br><br>  That's how I first got into the studio with a full division of labor.  Here the artist draws characters, ‚Äúas it should be‚Äù in the Discobol pose (although I, other modelers from our studio and other modelers from around the world could not prove that we still need to draw in a <a title="... character's pose when he stands, putting his legs shoulder-width apart and spreading his arms strictly to the sides ..." href="http://3dyuriki.com/2009/06/21/t-obraznaya-poza-slovar/">T-shape</a> ).  Modelers who are trying with all their might to brush when creating a sweep of texture UV-coordinates.  Pregnant textureists - draw insanely beautiful textures.  Visualizers, which as it should be thin and tall.  <a title="... a person who is engaged in setting up 3d-characters - a setup ..." href="http://3dyuriki.com/2009/06/21/setap-cetapshhik-slovar/">A setup man</a> who was just yesterday an animator, etc. <br><br>  But of course, I learned about all this much later than on the first day of work.  Usually it takes me a lot of time to join the team.  It happened this time.  Until that day when I came to the studio in the morning and FOR THE FIRST TIME, I SAW: ‚ÄúYes, you smile, we are doing a cartoon!‚Äù - three months remained. <br><br>  After waiting for the next part of the story, you will find out why only one modeler should have stayed at the studio, how the animation studio is arranged from the inside, why workers don‚Äôt see that they are making a funny cartoon and many other details. <br><br>  The next part of the story - <a href="http://3dyuriki.com/2009/06/30/kakovo-eto-rabotat-na-ukrainskij-piksar-chast-vtoraya/">What is it like to work for ‚ÄúUkrainian Pixar‚Äù.</a>  <a href="http://3dyuriki.com/2009/06/30/kakovo-eto-rabotat-na-ukrainskij-piksar-chast-vtoraya/">Part two</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63296/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63296/</a></p>
