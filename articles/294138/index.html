Scientists and psychologists divide people into audials, visuals and kinesthetics.  For each type of perception, there are different rules for memorizing and reproducing information.  Visual information is perceived and remembered much faster.  Such a phenomenon in science is described as ‚Äúthe effect of image superiority‚Äù. <br><br>  The essence of such a psychological phenomenon is explained by the fact that the brain is not able to perceive a word until it examines certain features of letters.  And the image, in turn, can significantly increase the speed of information processing.

      People are able to memorize two and a half thousand images and reproduce them with 90% accuracy.  Most of these images are deposited in the brain for many years and are further associated with one or another word.  For this reason, we associate brands with certain logo images. <br><br>  In mailing lists you can achieve the same effect of perception and assimilation of information, if you use different types of visual content. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The bulk of subscribers view messages very quickly.  Therefore, to make the meaning fully conveyed to the recipient, it is better to use illustrative material. <br><br>  For newsletters, such visual content is perfect: <br><br>  <b>Images</b> <br><br>  Jeff Bullas <a href="http://www.jeffbullas.com/2012/05/28/6-powerful-reasons-why-you-should-include-images-in-your-marketing-infographic/">found out</a> that text diluted with pictures is read to the end 94% more often than the version without images. <br><br>  For mailings it is best to use unique images.  Bright, adapted to the corporate image template helps to shape the recognition of the company. <br><br>  <i>Where to look for images for mailings:</i> <br><br>  <u>Photo stock:</u> <br>  <a href="http://photogenica.ru/">Photoogenica</a> - for customers SendPulse discount on all images 20%. <br>  <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/">Shutter stock</a> <br>  <a href="http://depositphotos.com/">DepositPhotos</a> et al. <br><br>  <u>Free image catalogs:</u> <br>  <a href="http://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a> <br>  <a href="http://deathtothestockphoto.com/">Death to Stock Photo</a> - monthly mailing stock photos to your email <br>  <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> - choose only those images where commercial use is allowed. <br><br>  <u>Online image creation and processing services:</u> <br>  <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> - creating images in a block editor <br>  <a href="https://pixlr.com/">Pixlr</a> - image processing service <br>  <a href="https://buffer.com/pablo">Pablo by Buffer</a> is a simple image creation service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea5/cb6/268/ea5cb62685b3404ca580bc9bf16b93cd.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Video</b> <br><br>  Due to the rapid growth in popularity of smartphones and other electronic gadgets, online video is gaining more and more turns, gaining the attention of subscribers.  <b>Video on ezines improves campaign performance by an average of 40%.</b>  So it is worth at least to test this feature. <br>  Video tutorials, webinars, usage guides, video reviews, etc. are great for newsletters.  So use. <br><br>  <b>Infographics and charts</b> <br><br>  Infographics - a great way to submit complex material in simple diagrams.  In addition, infographics are absorbed much faster than text. <br>  At this stage, infographics claim a key role in the content strategy of any company.  There are several reasons for this: <br><ul><li>  Visual information is perceived faster. </li><li>  Infographics have high viral potential.  It is often shared on social networks and blogs, which gives additional coverage. </li><li>  Infographics can be both an addition to textual information and an independent element of content. </li></ul><br>  For email newsletters, infographics are incredibly useful, because it allows you to convey the basic meaning of the message in a matter of seconds, even during a quick glance. <br><br>  You can create infographics both with the help of familiar graphic programs and in online editors: <br><br>  <a href="http://visual.ly/">Visual.ly</a> <br>  <a href="https://infogr.am/">Infogr.am</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.easel.ly/">Easel.ly</a> <br><br>  With schematic illustrations, the situation is even simpler.  All you need is skills to work with objects SmartArt or basic knowledge of graphics programs. <br><br>  <b>Internet memes</b> <br><br>  The term "ma'am" was first introduced back in 1976.  According to the original meaning, ma'am is an idea that can transform into different meanings depending on the person.  In the network, "ma'am" is associated with humorous statements on the images. <br><br>  However, with the use of Internet mems you need to be careful.  They will certainly help to stand out from the competition and relieve tension.  You can even make jokes yourself about your field of activity.  But will they be perceived adequately by a more adult and serious target audience?  Need to test and verify. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d76/752/eb3/d76752eb3ec24537833037c01f9e6687.jpg"></div><br><br>  <b>Presentations</b> <br><br>  With the advent of the SlideShare service, presentations have reached a new level.  Now it is not closed material for reports within the company.  This is a high level of viral content that can be shared with the world.  The main thing is to make the presentations not so formal. <br><br>  An excellent example of a viral presentation is the Rand Fishkin report <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/randfish/why-content-marketing-fails">"Why content marketing can be a failure</a> . <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/randfish/why-content-marketing-fails">"</a>  Easy, unobtrusive, with humor and excellent illustrations, but without losing the benefit of the author told the main mistakes in planning content marketing and its placement. <br><br>  In the delivery of the presentations will perform the same function as the infographics: quick familiarization.  So use! <br><br>  <b>Screenshots</b> <br><br>  If you work with services, applications, computer games or any other online resources - screenshots in the mailing list will be a great way for you to show your internal processes to subscribers, as well as features of working with platforms or applications. <br><br>  In order to take a screenshot, you can use the services of Cropp.me or Monosnap.  In the same place you will be able to add the necessary text to the screenshot or create the legend. <br><br>  Use the possibilities of visual design to the maximum and create useful newsletters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca2/9ba/b7f/ca29bab7f3794b228bb1e1dfecf86916.jpg">  Irina Chugay, marketer <a href="https://sendpulse.com/">SendPulse</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294138/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294138/</a></p>
