  <section class="page js-page"><h1>6 Tips for Choosing VPS Hosting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  If you are a professional in the field of IT, then, most likely, you perfectly understand what to look for when choosing the right <nobr>hosting provider</nobr> .  However, if you are just starting to engage in e-commerce or you do not have sufficient resources for qualified assistance, then this choice may not be easy.  Today we have prepared 6 basic tips that will help you understand what exactly is important in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/VPS">VPS</a> hosting and what is not. </p><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/186/e53/da0/186e53da0ff74101897af2ae8fb69560.png" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><p>  The essence of <nobr>VPS hosting</nobr> is that one server works as an individual for several users, or in this case sites.  In other words, a dedicated server can be hosting only for one site, and <nobr>VPS hosting</nobr> for several (but not many).  It is an excellent alternative for dedicated hosting, as it offers a much lower cost and includes almost all the same features.  Each server uses its own resources, including its own operating system, memory, and disk space. <img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/330/ed7/08a/330ed708a1aa493498f25de98a59cf09.gif"></p>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
    <p>  There are only a few sites on the server, which provides high bandwidth and sufficient disk space.  <nobr>VPS servers</nobr> guarantee high security, as a small number of sites are easily monitored for suspicious activity.  In case one site is hacked, attackers will not be able to access other <nobr>websites</nobr> hosted on the server.  These tips will help entrepreneurs and managers of information departments to choose the "correct" <nobr>VPS-hosting</nobr> . </p><br><br><h2>  Platform and technical specifications </h2><br><p>  You need to make sure that the service includes all the functions you need, as well as clarify server specifications and platform type.  Platforms such as VMware offer advanced server virtualization management capabilities, and provide fault tolerance, scalability and data storage. </p><br><br><h2>  RAM </h2><br><p>  This is the main element of any <nobr>VPS hosting</nobr> .  Its implementation depends on the RAM supported by the server.  From speed to efficiency and energy consumption, it all comes down to memory options.  For example, for the smooth operation of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPanel">cPanel</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallels_Plesk_Panel">Plesk</a> panels, you will need 512 MB of RAM, but if you use more than one site with high traffic, you will need up to 2 GB of RAM (depending on what actions are taking place on the site). </p><br><br><h2>  Flexibility </h2><br><p>  All <nobr>VPS hosting</nobr> plans should be tailored to your needs.  This means that if your traffic increases or decreases, you can change the settings of your server to meet the needs of your visitors and use data. </p><br><br><h2>  Control panels </h2><br><p>  Usually, Plesk or cPanel control panels are used for <nobr>VPS hosting</nobr> ‚Äî some of the best.  They give you the ability to efficiently manage <nobr>websites</nobr> , as well as control your domains, deal with errors, updates, create and manage email accounts, and troubleshoot problems.  The control panels are intuitive and allow you to maintain and update sites quickly, efficiently and safely. </p><br><br><h2>  Pricing </h2><br><p>  When your site is one of the most important assets, the cost of hosting should not be a decisive criterion for selection.  Of course, no one wants to overpay, but to pay less, having received low-quality hosting is irrational.  Keep the balance - do not overpay, but do not skimp on the quality, performance and so on. </p><br><br><h2>  Customer service </h2><br><p>  Before signing a contract, learn more about customer service at the company.  Conduct testing - say, call or write to your prospective provider of letters with questions that interest you.  Excellent if support is provided 24/7.  In this case, if there are complications early in the morning or at night, you will not have to wait long for help, and will also immediately signal to you in case of <nobr>any</nobr> security breach.  We hope these tips will clarify a bit for you exactly what you should pay attention to when choosing a <nobr>VPS hosting service</nobr> .  Since the transfer of servers is not such a difficult task, sometimes it takes a lot of time and a lot of effort is spent on choosing the best supplier for a long time. </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302366/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302366/</a></p>
