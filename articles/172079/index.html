  <section class="page js-page"><h1>World Digital Revolution</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr!  Recently, the network project <a href="http://code.org/">code.org</a> , dedicated to education in the field of IT.  The slogan: ‚ÄúEvery student in every school should have the opportunity to learn how to program.‚Äù  There is a video on the main page where celebrities, including Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, tell us why coding * is cool.  The authors of the project pose a question economically: the need for programmers and computer scientists is much higher than the number of students studying programming.  Few schools where they learn to code.  Convincing figures and diagrams are given.  This, of course, is about the United States, but it is not difficult to replace it in the text with any other country.  Also, code.org politically correctly hints that it is time to equalize the gender balance in computer science, so that more women know programming and program themselves for bread on a par with men. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f8/0c1/3cf/0f80c13cf738d01932e85ec79f3d6908.jpg" width="600"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Any sane geek and IT specialist will support code.org, because it pours balm to the very root of our existence.  Obviously, we are good guys, smart, creative, we rotate the modern world, we should be more, equal to us.  The issue of female programming, some males find it controversial, and I personally am in favor.  Women themselves will figure out whether they need to code or not, but the opportunity to learn this from them should be no less than that of men, and look askance at them for it is not necessary.  Moreover, the problem posed can be expanded and it can be useful to learn not only to code, but also to draw, design, model, write music from a tender age, and it is on a computer, because a computer is a universal tool for creativity.

      So, let's say code.org and the digital revolution are rapidly winning, and in 20-30 years, the computation of society reaches the very depths.  As well as reading and writing, children in school were taught coding.  In addition, they learned how to sculpt 3D models, do video editing, animation, web design, and write music.  With the rapid development and simplification of development tools, many things will become available to children.  Imagine that creating digital matter on a computer will be 100 times simpler, clearer and more fun than it is now.  And so, children grow up, possessing all these amazing skills, which only gigantic, often asocial citizens now possess (and that on average only one skill per such citizen falls on).  Suppose also that this is a worldwide phenomenon, and the negroes in a bamboo village and the Europoids in their sleeping area receive approximately the same charge of computer literacy.  Moreover, by that time this literacy will not be regarded as ‚Äúcomputerized‚Äù, it will simply be a set of basic skills, such as the ability to read, count, swim, ride a bike.  If for some reason you do not know how to animate in 3D, then you are a strange person, and you, probably, your parents often moved from place to place.  Well, coding - of course, anyway, what to write, it will be able to do everything. <br><br>  A wave of innovation is likely to come from the organizational side.  Means of joint development, crowdsourcing, as well as systems for organizing these processes have all chances to develop to wonderful heights.  There will be more flexible and ‚Äúfair‚Äù motivation schemes for network project participants.  Ideally, the average inhabitant of the planet, and even quite young, will be able to invest his time and energy in those projects that he likes, and himself act as a generator of new projects.  Then the current economic system, with its closeness, division into clans, secret technologies, corporate cultures, will be a gloomy dawn of the upcoming digital grace. <br><br>  And now, from our gloomy time, when it is difficult to make websites, and the server code is even more difficult, we are transferred to a digital utopia populated by the giant Leonardi da Vinci fed by computers that can concoct a website in 5 minutes, and they themselves decide what to do.  What will we see? <br><br>  Oh, friends, there is not much left.  We will probably see the victory of the world digital revolution all together. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab5/7d2/ac3/ab57d2ac32cb0f917fa9f7f6595be82e.jpg" width="500" height="305"><br><br>  (*) - I propose, finally, officially to make the verb ‚Äúcod‚Äù in Russian.
