Recently, our blog was a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/meizu/blog/167101/">post</a> about the release of test-firmware for Meizu MX, and soon there was a fresh test version of the firmware with Flyme 2.1.1 for Meizu MX2, based on Android 4.1.1.  So, in China, they are celebrating the New Year all the time, and the final versions of the firmware will probably appear only by the end of February.  We decided not to take so long and tell you about the updates in these firmware now, as well as posting here fresh versions of test firmware for the most curious.  If it is interesting to you - welcome under kat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/259/6ec/ebd/2596ecebd29d1fe64c92e0213613d203.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This brief instruction is correct for Meizu MX and Meizu MX2.

      Download the <b>update.zip</b> archive, then you need to <b>drop</b> it into the root folder of the smartphone, without unpacking.  Next, turn off the device and turn it back on, while simultaneously holding the <b>Volume Up + Power</b> buttons.  A firmware update window will appear.  Here it is recommended to put a tick in front of the ‚ÄúClear Data simultaneously‚Äù line, the device will update the memory when updating (so it‚Äôs better to backup), but after the update there will be less chances that the firmware will become unstable.  Next, you need to click the <b>Upgrade</b> button and wait for about a minute, about as much as the upgrade process takes.  The smartphone will reboot, "think" a little and, everything, the process of updating the firmware is completed. <br><br>  And now briefly about the changes in the firmware.  For clarity, the changes in the firmware for MX and for MX2 are described separately, in each case a screenshot of what the interface looked like before is given on the left, on the right - how it looked after updating the smartphone to Flyme 2.1.1. <br><br><h4>  <b>Innovations in Meizu MX</b> </h4><br>  <b>Lock screen</b>  In the new firmware slightly modified lock screen.  First, now you can quickly go to the camera, simply by sliding your finger across the screen to the right or left.  Secondly, Meizu modified the digital clock and date, their appearance became more similar to that of the Meizu MX2 smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/512/1a1/3b9/5121a13b990dd56a6ec84229bf6b109b.jpg" width="300" height="450"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/964/f8b/21f/964f8b21fefc18f30666d6ae6c395108.jpg" width="300" height="450"><br><br>  When charging and playing music, the remote control and battery icon changed slightly. <br><br>  <b>Status bar.</b>  After unlocking, a diminished status bar is immediately noticeable.  Meizu decided to minimize its size to provide the user with more free space in applications.  Many may be upset because of the missing numbers of the battery charge, but do not worry.  This option is now enabled in the screen settings.  When opening the curtain, you will notice that a new switch has appeared - turning on / off auto-rotate the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec0/810/41d/ec081041dc73df92315b8acfa7ef2248.jpg" width="300" height="450"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/435/d4b/fe8/435d4bfe82a6e20a4c5acc7e1be545fa.jpg" width="300" height="450"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e7d/be1/1d4/e7dbe11d4952660f58454febeaec9103.jpg" width="300" height="450"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/928/da6/bea/928da6bea869a05e3e24e7c0eabd856c.jpg" width="300" height="450"><br><br>  <b>Menu running applications.</b>  Let me remind you that in Flyme OS the latest applications are called up by a long press on the right touch button.  The updated version has a button for quick access to settings, as well as a progress bar with adjustable screen brightness, as in Meizu MX2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f1/67e/e4b/9f167ee4b31e3e992f335d60932e5705.jpg" width="300" height="450"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/690/0e2/78d/6900e278d1dced885ce653ce2f66c7f3.jpg" width="300" height="450"><br><br>  <b>Work tables.</b>  As in MX2, MX now has the ability to add widgets directly from desktops.  Adding is done with a long press on the screen.  Also, the icons have changed a bit, now they look similar to the icons in MX2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/001/72f/cfb/00172fcfbac8c79976df7856101e1793.jpg" width="300" height="450"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d0c/b64/812/d0cb6481234e07ba960ba2adc73011d7.jpg" width="300" height="450"><br><br>  <b>A separate menu of location settings.</b>  Now you can choose which location tools to use (GPS, Wi-Fi and / or network readings). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d57/7f4/3bc/d577f43bcdbe81a4ed73163b43bebb43.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Video.</b>  At first glance, the video player has become easier, but it is not.  All player control is transferred to gestures.  Using left / right gestures, you can control playback, the up / down gesture on the left edge is responsible for adjusting the volume, on the right - for the screen brightness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9bd/803/756/9bd803756022f73d0c9419a125735d32.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f1c/4aa/1fb/f1c4aa1fb7ac761aa470d4db1753bb7f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/874/ee8/561/874ee8561f07c784bc14fe872670ee9c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a72/b96/d32/a72b96d327c1df7159462ed46ee5bce0.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Screenshots</b>  To take screenshots, you now need to use the standard key combination <b>Turn On + Volume Down</b> , instead of the previously used Turn On + Home button. <br><br><h4>  <b>Innovations in Meizu MX2</b> </h4><br>  Smartphone Meizu MX2 also received an update to version Flyme 2.1.1.  Now we can say that Meizu made a new universal version of Flyme for all devices.  But if in the first MX the update is global in nature (the interface has become more modern and fresh), then in the case of MX2 we are talking about a small ‚Äúupdate‚Äù with several important changes. <br><br>  <b>Camera.</b>  One of the important points of the work that developers are currently engaged in is improving the camera and improving the quality of the final images.  In the new test version of sewing (8199), the amount of noise in the pictures was slightly reduced, the quality and accuracy of focusing improved (users had justified claims to the autofocus on MX2) and the white balance detection system, the smartphone became less likely to make mistakes with the BB settings when shooting. <br><br> <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/OyPKDgNq2gFwx"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/460/ea2/c98/460ea2c98b5b2822dd0f92199e25222a.jpg" width="250" height="333"></a>  <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/XTdRZY1u2gFzV"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/221/555/322/221555322fb7b526ea0dfe189b997d35.jpg" width="250" height="333"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/rF_NbxQH2gG0x"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d7/096/d5c/5d7096d5c6e3ec9e4f5d0a4c04cdc7c5.jpg" width="250" height="333"></a>  <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/-yQrsqF02gG1L"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9a/7fd/038/c9a7fd03819a6f00c0ab74dd35fa1012.jpg" width="250" height="333"></a> <br><br><a href="http://yadi.sk/d/42XdFEJs2gG51"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3b6/2b0/d74/3b62b0d748d9349b3199417b014ca8cc.jpg" width="333" height="250"></a>  <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/xZ19PIEf2gG7R"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/004/fef/a3c/004fefa3cc550bb4521116e24bc8f8aa.jpg" width="333" height="250"></a> <br><br>  <b>Status bar.</b>  If we talk about visual changes, then it is worth noting the changed status bar - as in the update for the first MX, it has become more compact.  Now to display interest you need to put the corresponding checkbox in the settings.  To be honest, not everyone likes this change, we and many users, both in Russia and in China, consider the double string to be a Flyme chip.  Moreover, the Chinese forum Meizu has already appeared to build the final version of the test firmware with a line from Flyme 2.0 (double) - which also clearly demonstrates the reluctance of some owners of Meizu MX2 to lose this chip.  It remains to hope that the people responsible for the approval of the final version of the firmware at the head office of the company will still take a step back in this regard.  But maybe the string will remain single.  Along with a decrease in the height of the status bar, there is an increased indent from the bottom row of icons with a browser icon in the center.  This change also raises questions (in my opinion, the indent in the old Flyme looked neater), but by the time the final version of the firmware was released, it could still be changed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d3/ff3/273/0d3ff32731bdffdb629d581f59db4515.jpg" width="300" height="480"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/022/5fe/55b/0225fe55bc96a2f6417bf6a5eae98b7a.jpg" width="300" height="480"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cde/f0f/14d/cdef0f14dac09ae40a1200e9766443ad.jpg" width="300" height="480"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/375/bbd/cfe/375bbdcfe4d6a3a3ce17f478db07ab4d.jpg" width="300" height="480"><br><br>  <b>Menu running applications.</b>  The appearance of the menu of running applications has changed a bit and the speed of its launch has increased.  To close all programs, use the ‚Äúcross‚Äù in the right corner of this menu, and if you need to close applications one by one, you can simply swipe them off the panel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/52d/7ff/6b1/52d7ff6b17dd99bae8c86f2450a841f6.jpg" width="300" height="480"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c7f/c2b/f9d/c7fc2bf9def15f80cb3fb37777e1752a.jpg" width="300" height="480"><br><br>  The color of the SmartBar also changed from dark gray to close to black.  But this is a minor change. <br><br>  <i><b>PS</b> All described innovations are indicated on the basis of test versions of firmware, by the time of the release of the final versions some points may change.</i>  <i>Remember that you download and install test firmware at your own risk.</i> <br><br><hr><br><h4>  <b>News in short:</b> </h4><br>  Since February 18, the cost of Meizu MX 4-core smartphones has been reduced: <br>  <b>Meizu MX 32 GB - 15 500 rubles</b> (the old price is 17 997) ( <a href="http://mymeizu.ru/shop/11/desc/meizu_mx_4-core">link to the smartphone page in the store</a> ) <br>  <b>Meizu MX 64 GB - 17 500 rubles</b> (the old price is 19,997) ( <a href="http://mymeizu.ru/shop/12/desc/meizu_mx_4-core-64">link to the smartphone page in the store</a> ) <br>  When you buy any of these smartphones, a protective film on the screen and a <a href="http://mymeizu.ru/index/ep20_headset/0-44">Meizu EP20S</a> branded headset as a gift. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169749/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169749/</a></p>
