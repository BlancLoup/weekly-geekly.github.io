  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IBM Watson analyzed Star Wars characters, describing the main characters</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>This post has no relation to April 1, except for the date of publication.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b6/4e5/6db/4b64e56db64a4b88bc602ccb51697f7b.jpg"><br><br>  One of the capabilities of the IBM Watson cognitive system is to analyze almost any text, including fiction.  The computer can evaluate the characters described by the author, and does it quite accurately.  A rather popular Big Five personality test is used for evaluation.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2588%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D1%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%2528%25D0%25BF%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2529">The Big Five</a> is a dispositional (from English disposition - predisposition) model of a person‚Äôs personality.  It continues the line of research begun by G. Allport, G. Ayzek and R. Kattel, who assumed that personality characterizes the measure of individual differences of a person in the degree and form of adaptation to the social environment, taking into account the biological properties of the individual.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

      This model assumes that a person‚Äôs personality includes five common and relatively independent features (dispositions): <br>  ‚Ä¢ extraversion, <br>  ‚Ä¢ goodwill (friendliness, ability to come to an agreement), <br>  ‚Ä¢ conscientiousness (conscientiousness), <br>  ‚Ä¢ neuroticism (opposite pole - emotional stability), <br>  ‚Ä¢ openness to experience (intellect). <br>  The main statistical tool for extracting the model is factor analysis.  So, it was for this test that the main characters of the Star Wars universe were evaluated, and the original trilogy scripts were taken as the source material.  About what happened - next <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Jedi - the least neurotic (emotionally unstable) characters</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c9/91a/d3b/4c991ad3bf594364a2c06552b032c749.jpg"><br><br>  Among Jedi, Master Yoda is the most stable emotionally.  Even Darth Vader is calm and confident - but here it is worth remembering that before moving to the side of the Empire, he was a Jedi. <br>  But Yoda, however, is also the least appeasable character.  He also almost never shows sympathy for anyone. <br><br>  <b>The most neurotic character is C-3PO.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65a/fc1/c78/65afc1c7866f47ed9bf5f2e53551b9e6.png"><br><br>  There is nothing surprising.  To the naked eye, it is noticeable that C-3PO is as unstable emotionally as possible.  Then there is Luke (yes-yes), and the third place is taken by Han Solo. <br>  In general, that's right - the characters are good, but you can't call them calm. <br><br>  <b>Intellectual - Obi Wan Kenobi</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d69/04e/e70/d6904ee70ecb48f7b63903ab6fa778e6.jpg"><br><br>  The system rated him as the smartest of all the heroes of the trilogy, but put it on the last place for such characteristics as cheerfulness. <br><br>  Van Kenobi clearly knew Zen, so to speak, and he completely controls his emotions.  At the same time, anger and joy, as well as other feelings, are not too close to him. <br><br>  <b>Luke received a maximum on such characteristics as anger, morality and compassion.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb7/822/323/cb782232341c4c4bb21c97c08ae883ea.png"><br><br>  In the trilogy, Luke is really angry.  In addition, he hates the Empire (it probably happens if your demon-like father leaves you and sends stormtroopers to destroy your house). <br><br>  As a result, Luke has a pretty strong feeling of ‚Äúright‚Äù and ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù  Luke received high marks in terms of depression and anxiety. <br><br>  <b>Han and Leia - the most friendly characters</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e14/78c/4f8/e1478c4f82ab4f4d9a2bd69837acf6bf.jpg"><br><br>  This is probably why they have become a great pair.  Their trust is great too.  Han Solo is also an optimist.  But Khan is very shy, although this is not immediately noticeable.  But if you analyze his dialogues, it becomes obvious. <br><br>  <b>Vader and Yoda - intellectuals with mild emotions</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/130/538/b12/130538b12b77424696b902b54ee54e6b.jpg"><br><br>  They are smart, very smart - the intelligence of Vader and Yoda is quite high.  But they can hardly be called friendly or docile. <br>  In this case, the Watson score allows you to estimate how thin the line between good and evil can be.  Both characters are very similar psychologically, but they are antagonistic characters. <br><br>  <b>The rebels are able to achieve goals, and the Empire - the most disciplined</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/748/b96/5c8/748b965c850b4b4ead2b285a28374d17.jpg"><br><br>  Here, too, nothing surprising - and the rebels, and the adherents of the empire have their own distinctive features.  Some try to achieve their goals and do it through willpower.  Others also achieve their goals, but already thanks to discipline and submission.  Imperials are unemotional, but the rebels are energetic and active. <br><br>  <b>As output</b> .  Probably many Star Wars fans themselves are able to give similar characteristics to their favorite characters.  But here it is worth remembering that IBM Watson is a cognitive system that does not at all ‚Äúthink‚Äù like a human being.  Nevertheless, the computer was able to draw the correct (although sometimes unexpected) conclusions from the information transmitted to it.  By the way, IBM Watson analyzed the entire Harry Potter cycle.  So assessments of the characters created by JK Rowling are <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/ibms-watson-analyzed-harry-potter-2016-3">already available too</a> (eng.).  We will write about this a little later. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392545/</a></p>
