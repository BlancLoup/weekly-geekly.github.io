      Most of all will receive projects in the field of computer technology development - up to 2.5 billion. <br><br>  According to Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, enterprises currently being developed - the winners of the competition, will reach the required level by 2018.  So far, of all domestic companies, only T-Platforms and the Moscow Center for SPARC Technologies (MCST), the Elbrus microprocessor developer, have announced their intention to take part in the Minpromtorg contests. <br><br>  In order to understand the situation, we asked people who were familiar with the situation on the electronics market in Russia, in general, to get an opinion of the direct market participants and industry experts, to comment on this proposal of the Ministry of Industry and Trade. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>The publication is updated as comments are received.</i> <br><br>  Artyom Subbotin, <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/15358/">creator of Simkomat</a> and CheckU: <blockquote>  As far as I understood from the text, this is not about a grant, but about compensation for the loan rate.  The Ministry of Industry and Trade covers up to 90% of the loan rate.  As for me, and in my comments I will speak only for myself - this kind of state generosity is not exactly what is needed. <br><br>  Nobody gives loans now, so we have nothing to compensate for.  And in general, all components (which are not produced in Russia) soared in price twice.  Therefore, many out of the market for the production of "iron" and went into the software.  Many switched to a foreign client using Russia as an assembly site.  In short, many ‚Äúiron‚Äù start-ups and small companies ‚Äúbuckled‚Äù under the new realities of Russia and changed their strategy. <br><br>  It is very difficult to create something from ‚Äúnothing‚Äù and 99% of the entire component base is purchased by us outside of Russia, most of it in China, something in Europe.  The ruble has fallen twice, almost killed our R &amp; D and everything connected with the "iron".  Therefore, like many, we plunged into the software and began to customize sales outside of Russia.  This is a market that dictates its conditions. <br><br>  In other words, there is no question for us to build new assembly facilities, rent offices, and in general, somehow expand.  We try to buy something for rubles (programmers) and sell for dollars (product). <br>  Therefore, for us, a small ‚Äúiron‚Äù startup, the best product from the government would be to compensate the ruble exchange rate when purchasing components abroad ... </blockquote><br>  Herman Klimenko, ‚ÄúIRI‚Äù: <blockquote>  It seems to me strange the desire of the Ministry of Industry and Trade to help the participants in the import substitution program of the radio-electronic industry not with targeted investments in development, but with compensation for the costs of servicing loans. <br><br>  Each company has its own, unique, economic base (conditions of exploitation of land, buildings, tax structure) and it is somewhat strange to hold a competition between them to find the winner.  Much more honest and more correct - it is to help those who are in the most difficult situation.  Who foreign currency loans and overdue.  Although my personal opinion is: we need to help those who are doing well, and not those who have driven their enterprises into credit debts and are now counting on help for our taxes. </blockquote><br>  Pavel Mussel, business consultant (former Healbe digital director): <blockquote>  The main comment is that no money will replace the lack of industry.  It needs to be developed from scratch - it is a very long process.  There is no industrial design, no production, no managers capable of really effectively moving the industry. <br><br>  The big problem with science, which is bent - there are grandfathers who ‚Äúmade‚Äù the cosmos, are now good, and all the more motivated scientific workers of the unit.  Soon there will be no one to teach them, develop new ones.  Will we call the Chinese? </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296692/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296692/</a></p>
