However, the majority will step on all possible rakes scattered along the road to success.  Reducing the risks is quite possible - for this you need to listen to the advice of people who have gone this way, and correctly apply them in practice.  Maxim Spiridonov, head of the <a href="http://roiber.ru/">Royber</a> production center <a href="http://roiber.ru/">,</a> is an expert who professionally gives advice on how to promote web projects.  In his lecture for students of the specialization <a href="http://www.rma.ru/internet/about.html">‚ÄúManagement in the field of Internet technologies‚Äù the</a> specialist consistently described the main steps in the promotion of a successful Internet project. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  First, Maxim Spiridonov spoke about his attitude to Internet projects with the implemented Web 2.0 technology. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere is no difference between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0.  At least in terms of business.  From this point of view, there are only projects successful and unsuccessful.  Over the past few years, the charm of Web 2.0 has been sweeping the wave of young people, especially web developers, who have seen new projects sold for millions of dollars.  As a result, they strive to build something that does not carry the signs of Web 2.0 and then, in their opinion, everything will take place.  I saw in my memory 50-70 such sites - with decent design, but not working from a business point of view.  The creators simply did not take into account that the Internet project should be treated as a business - to plan, track, find and invest money.  Here, as in acting, knowing the plasticity, the character's actions, you need to go on stage and forget it.  Know the technological basis when developing, but treat the site as a commercial project. ‚Äù

      Any project must begin with the definition of a viable and competitive idea that would bring profit.  The head of the production center "Roiber" gave a number of tips on how to find such an idea. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worth starting with market research and finding a niche for your project. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Suppose there is a desire to build a project, but you still do not know where to start.  First of all, think about what you know, what experience you have.  As elsewhere, in Web technologies it is better to do what you know how and about what you know more than an amateur. <br>  ‚Ä¢ You need to build a business, not trade in air. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The idea should be from a well-known area or you can get a competent consultant you trust. <br>  ‚Ä¢ It so happened that in the development of the Internet we lag behind Europe by 2-3 years, and from the USA by 3-5 years.  Thus, you can try to see how your idea was implemented in Europe and the USA.  That is, you get a certain time machine - you can see what will happen to your project in the future. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Considering all the factors that have been named, you can choose the final version of the idea. ‚Äù <br><br>  Then Maxim Spiridonov told about the preparatory work for the project. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFirst of all, we are preparing a project concept - a concise version of the description of the idea, audience, prospects, development paths, etc.  When the concept is ready and there is an understanding between its authors, you can proceed to the drafting of a business plan.  It consists of a number of components.  I highlight five: <br><br>  1. <b>The idea.</b>  To project was alive.  It can be presented in different ways - in a found niche, in an invention, in marketing. <br>  2. <b>Team.</b>  A team can sometimes be understood not as a group of people, but as an entrepreneur. <br>  3. <b>Money.</b>  They can be their own, borrowed, maybe some investor in the share. <br>  4. <b>Timeliness.</b>  She sometimes plays a crucial role. <br>  5. <b>Good luck.</b>  A variable that is not predicted or calculated.  It also happens that carries those who have an idea and not very much, and the team is so-so. <br><br>  Having created a business plan, we turn to the financial plan.  We describe all the expenses, we calculate the potential profit from the project, we introduce various coefficients.  A financial plan should ideally show all expenses - all that you have to spend, distributed monthly, and approximately determine the profitability.  When you have a business plan and a financial plan, you go to the technical assignment.  Sometimes this is part of a business plan, sometimes not.  This document should describe the project as completely as possible.  It is so complete that any team, without attracting you as a consultant, can implement it.  Following the technical task or in parallel with it, it is necessary to determine the state.  This is very important, because people who know and know how to do something on the Web, just like everywhere else, are deficient. ‚Äù <br><br>  After describing the sequence of preliminary work, Maxim Spirdonov went directly to the topic of the site development. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat to choose for development - your team or outsourcers?  It depends on how complex and technological your project is.  The command is convenient that the code remains in "economy".  Therefore, the more complex the project, the more technologically and original it is, the more desirable it is to take your team.  You must also decide whether to write code from scratch or use a CMS.  CMS to implement faster and cheaper, but they have a number of disadvantages - lack of flexibility in settings, insecurity with respect to malicious actions and low resistance to stress. <br><br>  Separately, I would like to note the importance of respecting the technological chain in the development of the site.  First of all, the issue with business logic is solved.  Then the site is snapped up in interface design programs (MS Visio, Axura).  Only after designing the interface, the transition to the design is made.  Then - layout, which should be friendly to search engines.  Correct layout should be well displayed in all browsers.  Programming can take place simultaneously with the layout, but better after the design.  And the final stage of development is integration, when everything is brought together and can be displayed by the browser. ‚Äù <br><br>  During the lecture, the head of the production center "Roiber" also touched upon the problem of legal support of the development process of his project. <br><br>  ‚ÄúReferring to the technical part of project development, we turn to legal issues.  It is advisable to immediately create a legal entity for your project.  On a legal entity, you can enter into agreements with performers in which you will no longer appear as an individual.  There is an important moment of transfer of copyright and it is desirable that these rights are transferred to the company.  A complex topic is the design of patents.  To get a patent in Russia is not easy.  However, if you have interesting discoveries, they should be patented.  And to patent for themselves. " <br><br>  In addition, Maxim Spiridonov answered questions of specialization that students were interested in. <br><br>  <b>- Does word of mouth work when launching a project?</b> <br>  - This is as unpredictable as viral marketing.  You cannot predict its effect. <br><br>  <b>- What are the criteria for calculating the cost of a Web project that is still being developed?</b> <br>  - I think you yourself know it.  There are techniques for the number of unique users, registered users, active users.  But in Russia, unfortunately, there are no statistics on the cost of the registered user, for calculation. <br><br>  <b>- How is the site transferred to the balance when it is sold?</b> <br>  - The site can be considered as a software product.  As well as a trademark to be sold as a name.  Domain can also be subject to sale.  Separately transferred staff - as part of any company. <br><br>  <b>- How do you feel about the prospects for the development of startups in a crisis?</b> <br>  - Complex issue.  Web startups are such a thing, in which the psychological component is important.  When everything raged around Web 2.0 projects, it stimulated the creators of startups.  Now it has become harder - more and more they are taking care not to lose their pants and feed their families. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47582/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47582/</a></p>
