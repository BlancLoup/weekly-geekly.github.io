      <b>Let's share stories.</b> <br><br>  My history: <br><blockquote>  We play hotsit threesome with classmates against 5 "computers".  I somehow terribly quickly developed to upgraded titans.  And then a dispute arose as to whether the ‚ÄúArmageddon‚Äù spell affects the upgraded titans.  During the battle, I was forced to put up the Armageddon, I refused.  Then these two men overcame me, went to the pain, the one that kept hold of the hold, and the second joined the battle with the NPC and, smiling maliciously, castanul.  Everyone has such friends. </blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/levordabesov/" class="user_link">LevOrdabesov</a> : <br><blockquote>  We still play with our spouse. <br>  Favorite soundtrack: <br>  * tyry-tyry-tyryryry <br>  tyry-tyry tyryry * <br></blockquote><br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/skyhunter/" class="user_link">SkyHunter</a> : <br><blockquote>  My story: I almost fell for the first session.  The end. </blockquote><br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/eldhenn/" class="user_link">Eldhenn</a> : <br><blockquote>  For me, the characters began with a dialogue: <br>  - Remember, you wanted the game to be like Warlords and King's Bounty? <br>  - Well? <br>  - Come on 14 floppy disks! </blockquote><br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/jaddd/" class="user_link">jaddd</a> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/comment_images/fe0/877/948/fe0877948db4670d3a688feb563ab7d9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/takezi/" class="user_link">takezi</a> : <br><blockquote>  As it was played with a friend hotsit in the second heroes.  And his huge army, perfidiously (we carried out diplomacy outside the game), attacks my castle (this was given the nominal name ‚Äúknife in the back‚Äù, because it was not the first time it was used).  Two wizard armies, he has a barbarian hero, I have a wizard.  It was a sooo long fight.  I had a lot of magic, he had dispel and blinding.  As a result, it so happened that there is only one titanium against the same solitary titanium.  There is no mana, no towers.  We did not know then that HP units could be watched, so after each shot, there was mourning with mats and dusting the head with ash.  We did not know whose shot would be fatal and would decide the outcome of the battle.  No other game brought so much emotion.  :) </blockquote><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xFwMI5pkS_o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/loadrunner/" class="user_link">LoadRunner</a> : <br><blockquote>  We had two armies of wizards, 75 golems, 5 archmags, one titan and many other small units, a lot of magic, the rival had dispelles and blinding.  Not that this was the necessary reserve for the battle, but if the battle began, it becomes difficult to stop.  The only thing that worried me was the inability to watch hp units.  Nothing in the world is more helpless, irresponsible and perverse than ignorance of the health of an opponent.  I knew that sooner or later someone would win. </blockquote><br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/vantela/" class="user_link">Vantela</a> : <br><blockquote>  Also tell your story from the game "hot suts." <br><br>  Sat three. <br>  Winter, late evening, lighting only monitor.  We play Heroes 3. <br>  I walk my hero.  And here‚Ä¶ <br>  The monitor with the characters goes out.  The music and sounds of the characters disappear.  A second of darkness and silence. <br>  On the monitor, there is still nothing and laughter.  Literally laughter from hell. <br>  Invasion from the measurement of virtual reality?  Scary hellish virus hacked our computer?  3 world war of mankind against AI began and more our computers do not belong to us? <br><br>  The monitor lights up ... and the Diablo screensaver appears there. <br>  It really was a laugh from hell. <br><br>  Debriefing showed that the third player was bored and sitting in front of the system unit - he pressed the SDROM button.  And there was a diablo drive ... <br><br>  But for the two of us, this laughter in front of a dark monitor was ... impressive. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c43/0f0/0df/c430f00df27dd40d58a08bc941ee3191.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/unlor/" class="user_link">unlor</a> : <br><blockquote>  Dorm.  Night (well, not quite deep, but somewhere around midnight).  I sit, I play heroes, a couple of comrades are watching nearby.  Then a roommate crawls on his eyebrows and immediately falls asleep (and the bed is right next to the table with the laptop).  It takes some time, I was distracted for a second, and then during my turn I suddenly stumbled on a computer in the midst of my possessions, which got out of the dungeon.  From surprise: "And what is this blue x * p in the middle of the map."  A voice from the bed: "Who is blue?"  Am i blue  I'm not blue. </blockquote><br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/msnus/" class="user_link">mSnus</a> : <br><blockquote>  From the stories: <br>  chasing the enemy magician on the big map, he is in the Underworld, my armies approach his empty cities above, and he does not have time to return ... <br><br>  He is desperate, but does not give up, and in order to do at least something, he enters into a stupid battle with a rather powerful group of creatures guarding some stupid artifact ... <br><br>  ... and the artifact is the Book of the Earth, with all the "Town portal", "Mass slow" and "Implosion".  I have no chance!  (( </blockquote><br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/antikiller/" class="user_link">Antikiller</a> : <br><blockquote>  I will say terrible: I have never been a fan of this game, as well as many other cult games.  I frankly badly duel in them, and when someone offers to play a card according to the old memory, I merge, it doesn‚Äôt draw me much. <br>  However, Hiros was not passed by me.  At the beginning of the two thousandths, when I didn‚Äôt have my kompl√ºhterna yet, I joined one company (this is a single block of memories).  Among other things, we had round-the-clock access to the office with an old Pentium.  During the day, the typewriter was used for work cases, but in the late evening hot heroes were launched on it, the benefit in this mode could be a sufficient number of applicants.  While another lucky man was pondering over his own move, the others were having fun, strumming the guitar, running outside to smoke, discussing strategies and other pioneer bazaars.  It was soulful.  And stuffy - the office was not very spacious. <br>  Actually, there and then I saw ‚ÄúHeroes‚Äù for the first time.  I did not know how to play, so I did not get into the line, enjoying more the atmosphere of what was happening.  And when it was already the last bus that was leaving home, the office continued the unhurried search for artifacts and the hydra battles with the skeletons under ‚ÄúKino‚Äù on three thieves' chords. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e1d/4d7/029/e1d4d702940c312324ba9278d561eda7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/dows/" class="user_link">dows</a> : <br><blockquote>  my story: a game in which I realized that to know the hexadecimal number is <br>  well and felt like a hacker)) about the mid-90s, I'm 14-15 years old, heroes 2, Warlock castle (Warlock), in which you can build black dragons, you play, of course, with bots (there were no others at that time - either with friends, or with a computer).  A large map, a lot of free time and love of magic.  Actually, you are developing the castle with all your might: you use the market, calculate each unit and attack, collect loot on the map.  You put black dragons and buy one.  Save the game.  You find the save file on your hard drive and open it in a text editor.  I do not remember the details, but you find a section of the record where your dragons are described and enter ‚ÄúFF‚Äù.  You save, you open and you have magic 255 black dragons.  Then you just wander around the map and clean up everything methodically, develop magic, strength, experience, mana, pull up new troops into one swung unit ... In the end, you get teleports, armageddon and handcuffs, so that the enemy will not run away from the battlefield.  And methodically you finish him in his castle, enjoying his sufferings and attempts ...

They gave me only 40 minutes a day, and therefore it was unbearably painful to wait each time) Therefore, I took notebooks, drew characters there, invented new ones and arranged fights on paper.
