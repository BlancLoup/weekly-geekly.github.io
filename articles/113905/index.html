  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to read the best abyss bash.org.ru</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I like to read the best abysses on the bash.  There are not so many funny quotes, but for some reason delays. <br>  And I also have a phone with Android, which is always at hand, and when there is free time, it would be very convenient to read the bash from him.  People who are in a similar situation probably know about Bogr.  Thanks to its author for a very worthy application, but I, as an irritable person, badly spoil the nerves of a few details.  To make life a little more pleasant, I would like a reader a little bit more convenient. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What I do not like: <br><br>  1. Navigation.  Those who have been at least once on the bash probably noticed that the search for a quote on which you stopped after going further is a very trivial task.  If you do not read avidly and the open page can hang up to several days, then the last quote you read may be either at the end of a new page or somewhere far behind.  I understand why this happens and for what reasons such an approach was chosen, but there is a problem. <br><br>  2. Flickering selection when scrolling.  The problem exclusively concerns the list in Android, is solved relatively easily, but here it is incredibly annoying. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      3. The absence of the Internet anytime, anywhere.  Just wanted to be able to read more than one page in terms of information isolation.  The least urgent problem for me, but since I took it ... <br><br>  It's good that we have some free time, you can write a simple application that solves these problems.  Here it is - <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.atdevsoft.apps.abyss">Abyss Reader</a> .  It downloads quotes to the base on the SD card, saves the quotation on which they stopped reading, goes back and forth through the pages.  That's all the functionality. <br><br>  It looks like just advertising another crafts for Android?  It would be so if it were not for the obvious (for those who dealt with the market) the impossibility to earn even ridiculous money on this reader (this was confirmed by as many as 3! Downloads of the free application without advertising in the first 12 hours).  On the other hand, there will definitely be people who, in principle, like it, but I want other sources, favorite quotes, font settings and some other benefits.  Therefore, the only correct solution is to open source codes. <br><br>  I did what I lack.  What you lack is where to start. <br><br>  Now links: <br>  Once again, the market: <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.atdevsoft.apps.abyss">Abyss Reader</a> <br>  Direct link to .apk for those who have problems with the market: <a href="">Abyss.apk</a> <br>  And <a href="http://code.google.com/p/abyss-android-reader">google code</a> <br><br>  PS <br>  I hope this topic will become an example for a person who has just recently shown his blank for Habr's reading room. <br><br>  If someone wants (for a reason that is completely incomprehensible to me, instead of making a repository clone) to finish the main branch, write - I will add to the list of participants.  The likelihood that I will develop the project is very small. <br><br>  Thanks for attention.  Enjoy reading. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113905/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113905/</a></p>
