One of the toys that left a positive impression was the Rubik's Cube "Cube-Tastic".  Perhaps you will like it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ed1/33c/da9/ed133cda9a7743ae88ddeda7ec1f0d52.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>We all came out of Gogol's "Overcoat" (s)</b> <br><br>  Now someone with censure, someone with bewilderment, and someone with some envy, perhaps, looks at those who twist spinners in their hands.  Moreover, the process of spinning in the hands of something does not cause questions: if you think about it, then our generation also twisted and twisted.  That came in vogue beads, then souvenir knives, butterflies, and the classic, which many are still devoted to, is the Rubik's Cube.  It would be blasphemy to call it an old ‚Äúanalogue of a spinner,‚Äù but if you wish, something common will be found.

      The cube is good in that it amuses and develops, and both children and adults.  The logical toy at the same time changed with time <b>and in form</b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d8d/dea/bb9/d8ddeabb908a4622b5808d972c04e517.jpg"><br><br>  <b>And on the "content":</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e2e/ad7/c17/e2ead7c173cf4db687467f829c0fd639.jpg"><br><br>  And, like so much in this world, it was developing in the direction of ‚Äúsimplification‚Äù - one of the ways to make a Rubik's cube easier was the options with fewer squares.  Another is the auto-selection of assembly algorithms.  Cube-Tastic is about the second. <br><br>  <b>How it works</b> <br><br>  It works, firstly, like a regular Rubik's Cube.  That is, no special instructions required by anyone.  Structurally, it is a classic 3x3 model with all the traditional twists and turns. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a59/100/3d7/a591003d72f84104a76cdc04eeb3b705.JPG"><br><br>  Unlike "ordinary" surface design - not inferior stickers, and hollow circles: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/af0/5bf/a49/af05bfa497474a17a9ad0bbbc3f17700.JPG"><br><br>  Central on each side is marked with a special icon.  This is important for an application with which a logical toy ‚Äúsynchronizes‚Äù.  Synchronization is, of course, too loud, and it works quite simply: the sides are recognized by the camera. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.putao.magiccube.cn">The</a> Cube-Tastic <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.putao.magiccube.cn">application is</a> Russified, and there will be no questions about the use. <br><br>  Recognition begins with a red center: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/375/3e6/a6d/3753e6a6dd1a48ea8243bfcdf27c253a.JPG"><br><br>  It is necessary to scan each of the parties in a certain sequence (the application will prompt). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3be/7df/910/3be7df9103dd499993ef1e8f5ec1dc28.jpg"><br><br>  And after that, the softphone will calculate the required number of steps to assemble the cube, depending on the complexity of mixing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/266/4ec/ae9/2664ecae96d24d74827f5c93e77f8f0a.jpg"><br><br>  Well, then everything is quite simple: by the tip, temporarily or manually switching screens with the steps of the algorithm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e0c/9ab/c71/e0c9abc71b2b4f17bce798893e3a1e2e.JPG"><br><br>  After that - beauty! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a99/ee2/a4c/a99ee2a4cf1c433e86edfc52846f4562.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Controversial issues we face</b> <br><br>  Remember, probably, as the hero of Evstigneev with a cry of "no need, I myself" broke my leg in Ryazanov‚Äôs film.  Here we, too, will immediately give you reasons for criticism. <br><br>  Firstly, the idea itself: not numerous, but there were some responses about the fact that it ‚Äúkills‚Äù the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Rubik's cube and dulls the owner.  We do not agree with this, because there is a Rubik's cube, it has not gone anywhere. <br><br>  Then, they say, the prices are bad.  Well, let's say, so, there are cheaper cubes.  On Aliexpress, wherever you go in the first place - <a href="https://ru.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-%2525D0%2525BA%2525D1%252583%2525D0%2525B1%2525D0%2525B8%2525D0%2525BA%2525D0%2525B0-%2525D1%252580%2525D1%252583%2525D0%2525B1%2525D0%2525B8%2525D0%2525BA%2525D0%2525B0.html%3Fspm%3Da2g0v.search0104.0.0.QVexu6%26site%3Drus%26SearchText%3D%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%2B%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%26g%3Dy%26SortType%3Dprice_asc%26groupsort%3D1%26tc%3Daf%26initiative_id%3DSB_20170724000811">from a hundred</a> .  In Moscow, from cheap came across and for 190-200 rubles, if not much to look for. <br><br>  Great hope and great disappointment befell in Auchan - there a cube costs as much as 360 rubles! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/799/2b6/811/7992b6811cee4d4cbc44951e2d672f4b.JPG"><br><br>  Moreover, there it was especially insulting to overpay, because it is, in fact, the Aliexpress distributed in price with the worst quality, but with instructions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/dc5/4cf/e15/dc54cfe1553d4f73958bd658951a2c20.JPG"><br><br>  Negligent stickers, and with non-classic colors, and the general feeling of owning the pleasure does not cause. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c1a/704/733/c1a7047331d3463c8c588d418cc00f20.JPG"><br><br>  Why are colors important?  Well, of course, because the application for the assembly has long been created for classic cubes.  That is, it seems like ‚Äúkilling an idea‚Äù Cube-Tastic certainly did not start <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.BodorGdev.fridrichsolver2%26rdid%3Dcom.BodorGdev.fridrichsolver2">first</a> . <br><br>  According to the link there are two options for assembling: a scan with a camera and manual clogging of colors, and in both cases, the cube from Auchan loses: for diamonds, the application was not sensitive, and the colors are not native. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/521/120/284/521120284af14579ab9546b1d73676a0.png"><br><br>  Visualization is also not so complicated, interactive, but is a free application. <br><br>  So, the price of the toy for which we started this post is <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/cube-tastic.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dcube%26utm_campaign%3Dtastic">990 rubles</a> !  "Total" or "Already" - this is up to you, but we would describe it as a "gift for the price of a souvenir." <br><br>  Wherein: <br><br><ul><li>  Pleasant to the touch </li><li>  Cute looking </li><li>  Interactive, aka "multifunctional" </li><li>  Classic, as in any way - that is, "not spinner" </li></ul><br>  It is sold quite richly: in an impressive corporate box: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/42b/459/2a9/42b4592a9690425881c900f3b688220c.JPG"><br><br>  In general, he initially seemed interesting and amusing, and turned out to be so in the future, therefore we recommend to look at the interested ones.  Whether it is itself, whether it is a gift - a thing of not first necessity, but also costs lifting money. <br><br>  All the more so since we have a classic 10% coupon for your patience: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Coupon</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  To buy <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/cube-tastic.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dcube%26utm_campaign%3Dtastic">Cube-Tastic at a discount</a> , you need to use the coupon: <b>WUCCKS</b> .
