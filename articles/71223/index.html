  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Billing Yota: do not believe the FAQ'y word</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For a start, a short quote from Yota Guide. <br><blockquote>  <b>2. What will happen if I do not have time to deposit money into the account before the first day of the month?</b> <br>  If on the first day of the month there is not enough money in your account to write off the subscription fee for the full month, then the Internet will be disabled for all devices connected to you.  You can make a payment for the rest of the month on any day of the month, and the device will work automatically. <br><br>  <b>7. If I do not pay one or several months, will I have a debt accumulate?</b> <br>  No, it will not.  Internet access will be blocked, your account will have a zero balance.  When you decide to reconnect to Yota, it will be enough to pay for the remaining days of the month. </blockquote><br><br>  Logical and fair, isn't it?  And it is very convenient: you will never go to minus.  So I thought, going on Sunday to go on a business trip until the end of the month.  Keeping in mind the official answers to these questions, I deliberately deliberately did not add money to my account, knowing that there would not be enough money for a subscriber in October and I simply would not be allowed to connect on the first day.  Moreover, I was going to turn off my modem today, because in the places of my secondment Yota will not work, and by the end of October I‚Äôll hardly appear inside its coverage area, i.e.  Pay for services makes no sense to me.

      And so, I went to my personal account, intending to turn off the device.  I will not say that I was very surprised, but lost the power of speech for a couple of seconds. <a name="habracut"></a>  Why?  Yes, because the amount in my account was <strong>negative</strong> !  The billing system Yota quietly wrote off the missing amount, drove me "in the negative."  I stuck the modem into the laptop port, and I was convinced that I hadn‚Äôt lost the Internet either.  Naturally, I paid the missing amount, because I am going to use Yota further, and 870 rubles (the amount I transferred to get out of the minus) I will save on something else.  Of course, I wrote to the support service, asking me to comment on what happened and explain the discrepancy between the information provided to customers and the actual behavior of the system. <br><br>  <strike>In any case, I want to warn everyone: to avoid unnecessary expenses, turn off the devices if necessary in advance, do not wait for the beginning of the month !!!</strike> <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : Yesterday (on Saturday, October 3, 2009) at 6 o'clock in the evening I received a call from the Yota support service and explained the situation.  As far as I understood from the explanation, the process of writing off money is two-step.  At the first stage, the money in the required amount is written off at all, with some of the accounts going into a minus.  The Internet is not disconnected from anyone.  During this stage, the user can see a negative balance by logging into his personal account.  At the second stage, users are selected whose balance is less than zero.  They are refunded the amount written off in the first stage, and the Internet is disconnected.  I have not come to that, because  I replenished the account.  As I understand, such a scheme was made to optimize database queries. <br><br>  In addition, I was offered to return the debited amount, since I was not going to use Yota in October.  I, however, refused it, because I still use it anyway, and maybe I will also use it at the end of the month. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71223/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71223/</a></p>
