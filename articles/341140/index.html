  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bonus vs depreirovanie</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Earlier in my practice I have not been able to develop either KPIs or methods for linking it to employee bonuses.  To fill out sheets-templates on subordinates, along the way grumbling at the stupidity and / or subjectivity of this action - it was.  Analyze the provisions on bonuses in the enterprise, to identify inconsistencies in the documents, obvious errors and inconsistencies - it was.  But what would drastically change or re-create the bonus system - this was not yet on my track record. <br><br>  But everything happens once for the first time.  Now this is my chance to give others a reason to grumble and criticize.  Under the cut - my attempts to explain why deprivation I like more than bonuses. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Actually the task: <br>  Develop a bonus system for two IT departments at a small enterprise in the real sector. <br><br>  Division 1 - conditionally the second line of technical support.  The company has a decent zoo systems and employees are quite unique.  Those.  in most cases, employee A cannot complete the work of employee B, and vice versa.

      Division 2 - project office.  Created from scratch.  It assumes the existence of universal RP under the introduction of IT projects.  The implementation itself should be carried out by consulting companies. <br><br>  An attempt to seek the help of friends did not give any special results.  All conversations over a cup of coffee ended, as a rule, with two conclusions: <br><br>  a) most of the known evaluation parameters are either meaningless, or subjective, or hard to measure, or have the ability to be manipulated by the evaluator or the evaluator; <br><br>  b) truly outstanding (most often one-time) results of a particular employee are often impossible to ‚Äúshove‚Äù into the framework of the KPI available in an enterprise, since  no eligible criteria.  And then the manager has to beat out a ‚Äúpremium over the premium‚Äù for such employees.  And this is only if the management has a keen sense of justice and is not lazy to spend their time on organizing the reward not for themselves. <br><br>  On my way to IT, I haven‚Äôt yet met a KPI system, about which I could say that it is not subjective.  Apparently, in compensation for this, my immediate leadership always solved the task of remuneration without prejudice.  I will not speak for my colleagues, but I definitely do not complain.  But, I suspect, not everyone is so lucky.  Therefore, I would like to develop something that will not be a test of moral stability for a manager, but will evaluate the work of an employee as objectively as possible. <br><br>  Alas, in the context of the task, I could not come up with any suitable parameter at all that could be used in KPI: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Number of closed tasks?</b>  In my experience for the organization of such a nature, the number of requests is either thick or empty.  In addition, when an IT specialist has direct contact with the user, there is a risk of manipulating this parameter. </li><li>  <b>Timing of tasks?</b>  The parameter itself is quite subjective, and in conditions of a large proportion of unique specialists, this subjectivity increases. </li><li>  <b>User satisfaction?</b>  In small companies, this is often a matter of personal relationships and nothing more. </li></ul><br>  Therefore, I propose to look at this question from a completely different angle.  In this case, the question ‚Äúfor what to reward the employee?‚Äù Turns into ‚Äúfor what to punish the employee?‚Äù. <br><br>  Here is a small list of unpleasant situations worthy of monetary punishment that have been in my practice and in the practice of colleagues: <br><br><ol><li>  Gross architectural errors (for example, development of services for business that are performed not on servers, but on local machines; development of solutions without coordination with specialists in related systems); </li><li>  Information hiding and the desire to become indispensable in the enterprise (for example, the use of its user passwords in executable modules; documentation of inadequate quality); </li><li>  Failure to perform a boring routine work (eg, drawing up protocols, instructions and documentation in general; performing routine maintenance); </li><li>  Jambs with backup and data loss; </li><li>  Unauthorized display in the product without proper testing, display without coordination with users. </li><li>  Not informing users about decisions made and communications in general. </li></ol><br>  In my view, depremia under the TC can be organized as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  Under an employment contract, an employee‚Äôs remuneration consists of 2 parts: salary and bonus; </li><li>  A list of possible ‚Äúprogresses‚Äù and their ‚Äúcost‚Äù are made in advance; </li><li>  By default, an employee is charged a bonus of 100%; </li><li>  If in the estimated period the employee made any mistakes, then the value of the bonus part accordingly decreases. </li></ul><br>  What are the advantages of this approach compared to the KPI theme? I see: <br><br><ol><li>  It does not require much time for development - there is no need to balance the parameters.  It is possible, following the example of our justice, to use the principle of absorption and addition within the monthly amount of the premium part.  Particularly bloodthirsty, of course, can use the American approach with the full addition and "smearing" of the resulting amount for a longer period. </li><li>  More flexible system, easily adaptable to changing situations.  The depremiration list can be expanded as new issues are discovered.  If during the reporting period the employee did something that is not on the list with the ‚Äúprice‚Äù - we believe that he was lucky and do not impose a fine.  At the same time, we update the list with the addition of a new item.  The task is not to deprive a person of money, but try to avoid the same mistake in the future.  It is possible to apply a differentiated scale - when you repeat the "price" error increases. </li><li>  If desired, all parameters used in KPI can be entered into this scheme, ‚Äúturning them inside out‚Äù: awarding for a percentage of closed tasks not less than X -&gt; depremating if the percentage of not closed problems is more than 100-X, etc. </li><li>  The ability to apply to the evaluation parameters, the measurement of which is very time consuming, using for this purpose spot checks.  For example, code compliance with technical regulations.  Building a KPI on random checks is somehow not fair, but depremation is acceptable in some cases. </li><li>  Shift the focus of the head of the unit on the problem areas.  If in the subdivision, similar errors occur again and again, this is an occasion to think about the effectiveness of the organization of the process. </li></ol><br>  In addition, I have some kind of personal dislike for KPI for areas where quality should prevail.  Initially, the promise of this system is not quite correct.  The bonus system tied to KPI for me looks like the following message from employers to an employee: <br><br>  <i>We assume that you do your work mediocre.</i>  <i>With the help of KPI, you have the opportunity to prove that it is not so and you do your work qualitatively.</i>  <i>Prove it!</i> <br>  In case the premium part is charged by default in full and only then is minus, with the same input, the meaning changes slightly: <br>  <i>We assume that you do your job efficiently.</i>  <i>Nevertheless, we check you, be ready for this.</i>  <i>Do not let me down!</i> <br><br>  It turns out such a question of the presumption of innocence. <br><br>  And how would you react to such a topic, touch it directly to you? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341140/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341140/</a></p>
