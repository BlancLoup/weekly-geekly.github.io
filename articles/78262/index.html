In November of this year, the Chinese division of Microsoft launched its own microblogging service called MSN Juku / Hompy / Mclub.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>2. The design and controls of the running service are a complete copy of Plurk.</i>  <i>Including an innovative key control in the form of a timeline moving from left to right.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>3. About 80% of the service code was stolen from Plurk (proof above)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>4. Plurk was never closely associated with Microsoft.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>5. Being a young startup, we are quite surprised and shocked by such actions.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Without knowing what to do, we need your support and suggestions.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Our Taiwanese users first told us that Microsoft had recently launched a microblogging service that strongly resembles Plurk in appearance.</i>  <i>Needless to say, we were very shocked and outraged when we saw with our own eyes how much Microsoft‚Äôs service is similar to Plurk.</i>  <i>Starting with the system of tabs, emoticons, accounting for karma and ending with action prefixes, support for media content and guides to new users.</i>  <i>All these distinctive features of Plurk were found in the new Microsoft service.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Find ten differences (in the screenshots) or what is common between Microsoft MClub (above) and Plurk (below)!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>A little inspiration never hurts, will you agree?</i>  <i>Of course, we understand that there will always be someone who wants to copy the design and navigation elements.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>popular and well-known services and use them in some of their local projects.</i>  <i>Plurk has already been the most popular microblogging service in Taiwan, 10 times ahead of Twitter in the number of users.</i>  <i>Being a kind of answer to it in the largest countries of East Asia.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Naturally, Microsoft, probably seeing a similar success, decided to unleash this potential in a similar service in the Chinese Internet space.</i>  <i>In the end, if someone managed to do a good thing, then others will copy it or try to adapt to another market.</i>  <i>This is natural for the Internet.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And most often these clones do not cause us concern.</i>  <i>But in this case there were exceptional circumstances in which we consider ourselves insulted, both in legal and moral terms.</i>  <i>The fact that Microsoft is doing this in broad daylight does not do credit to the company.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Allow me to clarify.</i>  <i>If it were just an external resemblance, then perhaps we would accept this.</i>  <i>We would not rush to criticize Microsoft, and could resolve this issue amicably.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>However, in reality, everything is sewn with white threads.</i>  <i>Upon closer inspection, we found that most of Microsoft‚Äôs MClub code and data structure one-to-one fits in with our code.</i>  <i>Microsoft took the source codes, libraries, css code, and did not even bother to disguise it.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Here are just three small examples (in the screenshots) of the hundreds of similarities that we found.</i>  <i>Any developer can see the copied and stolen code here.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Some bloggers have suggested that Microsoft Mclub / Juku was a kind of our partnership with Microsoft, which would allow us to re-enter the Chinese Internet market, closed today because of the Great Firewall of China.</i>  <i>It should be noted that before the decision of the Chinese censorship to ban our service, we were in the first place among the Chinese microblogging.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Let us shed some light on this situation.</i>  <i>Although many reputable Internet companies were partnering with Plurk, appreciating our innovations and market leadership in Asia, we absolutely had no contact with Microsoft.</i>  <i>We have never in any way contacted Microsoft.</i>  <i>And they did not give any prior written or oral permission to anyone on their side.</i>  <i>Nevertheless, they took away our code, took our CSS, having copied completely the essence and spirit of our service.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We are still in shock and ask ourselves the question: "Why did Microsoft go down to deliberate plagiarism without bothering to make any agreements?" steal.</i>  <i>The paradox lies in the fact that Microsoft is leading the fight for tougher intellectual property laws on the Internet, as well as opposing piracy in China.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>What next?</i>  <i>We are not quite sure, but we are exploring our possibilities.</i>  <i>We seek the advice of our colleagues, answer questions from the press, collect the facts of the whole chain of events.</i>  <i>In general, we are doing everything we can to understand why and how this event occurred.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We appeal to our millions of loyal users: we also need your help!</i>  <i>We need your strong and loud voices.</i>  <i>We want you to help us spread this important information to everyone.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Please translate this story, share it with local media, bloggers and friends, and help us fight for your favorite Plurk.</i> <br><br>  <b>UPD3:</b> <br><br>  In the blog of Plurk added contacts for the press and a link to our habratopik :) <br>  Perhaps the contacts will be interesting to those who want to find out the details for the press: <br><br>  Dave
