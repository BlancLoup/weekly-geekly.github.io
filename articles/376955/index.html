  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of online streaming news and media for February</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day. <br><br>  By the nature of my classes, I constantly follow the news of the online video industry, or if in English media streaming.  I often read something interesting that can be useful not only for me, but for everyone who works in the field of creating, processing, transmitting and monetizing streaming video and video-on-demand (video-on-demand).  Not so long ago, I decided to put aside something curious and see what happens. <br><br>  As a result - a selection of news for February and partly - January.  The review will not be in chronological order, but as it will.  I think it will not affect the quality of the material.  Yes, most of the materials are English, because  most newsmakers are western companies.

      But I'll start with our news. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/26/02/2015/54eee98b9a7947261b451021">Online cinema ivi.ru for the first time in five years, went to the operating profit</a> - says RBC.  The news is just great.  First, the Ivy teams are great.  Secondly, the dry numbers tell us that in the Russian market the user is ready to spend money on online video.  There is high-quality content and a convenient way to pay for it, which means piracy will not interfere with earnings. <br><br>  However, Ivi should not relax.  <a href="https://roem.ru/24-02-2015/185450/netflix-ru/">Netflix is ‚Äã‚Äãgoing to Russia</a> .  This means competition for rights to content and for the consumer‚Äôs wallet.  By the way, by the end of the year, the <a href="http://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/News/Online-Video-News/Netflix-to-Launch-Service-in-Japan-First-Expansion-to-Asia-101906.aspx">Netflix will sneak into Japan</a> , having extensive plans to seize world domination through 2016. <br><br>  A little more about international affairs and Russia.  Analysts from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/10/emerging-markets-ernst-young/">Enrst &amp; Young called China, India, Russia and Mexico the</a> most actively developing online media markets.  We have a strong penetration of broadband access and mobile Internet, which is only good for the industry.  If in the Old World and the USA the market has come to a certain stability, then in emerging markets everything is in full swing. <br><br>  YouTube this year marks 10 years.  At least the domain youtube.com <a href="https://twitter.com/Chad_Hurley/status/566758955490086912">was registered at this time</a> in 2005. <br>  According to the Wall Street Journal, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/viewers-dont-add-up-to-profit-for-youtube-1424897967">YouTube is still unprofitable</a> for Google (a brief <a href="http://blog.brid.tv/surprisingly-youtube-is-still-not-profitable-for-google/">retelling here</a> ), but the owner doesn‚Äôt make any attempts to make money, in particular, he is going to officially launch a <a href="http://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/News/Online-Video-News/YouTube-Will-Offer-Subscription-Service-for-Avoiding-Ads-102193.aspx">subscription to disable ads</a> and start to somehow encourage top content producers. .  Well, let's see. <br><br>  Several materials on the standards of transmission and display video. <br>  <a href="http://youtube-eng.blogspot.ru/2015/01/youtube-now-defaults-to-html5_27.html">YouTube now defaults to HTML5 video</a> : YouTube again on the wire.  We are told that now when opening a site by default, playback takes place without using Flash, everything starts playing through the HTML5 video tag, except when it is not supported. <br>  And as a supplement: <a href="http://www.dash-player.com/blog/2015/02/the-status-of-mpeg-dash-today-and-why-youtube-and-netflix-use-it-in-html5/">The status of MPEG-DASH today, and why YouTube &amp; Netflix use it in HTML5 &amp; beyond</a> .  In the past few years, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-DASH">MPEG-DASH</a> technology, which is now officially an ISO standard, began to actively develop.  Through the efforts of the leading industry flagships, it penetrates further and further, great efforts are being made to popularize and introduce it.  Google is one of the pioneers of the DASH Industry Forum - an organization that is finalizing the standard and working to promote it.  Our company not so long ago went there as an associate member, and we see that people there are really busy there. <br>  Microsoft in DASH-IF is also directly involved.  As a result: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2015/01/29/simplified-adaptive-video-streaming-announcing-support-for-hls-and-dash-in-windows-10.aspx">Simplified Adaptive Video Streaming: Announcing support for HLS and DASH in Windows 10</a> .  There are no comments here - Windows out of the box will understand the two leading media transfer technologies. <br>  However, Flash is still early to bury.  Jan Ozer explains in detail that the product of Adobe is alive and well: <a href="http://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx%3FArticleID%3D101801">Flash Is Dead Again (Yawn)</a> <br><br>  Some generalized information. <br>  <a href="http://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx%3FArticleID%3D101319">The Changing Face of DRM: Where Do We Stand in 2015?</a>  : an attempt by Jan Ozera to compile information about how things are now with the protection of content, in particular with DRM. <br>  <a href="http://www.streamingmediaglobal.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx%3FArticleID%3D102334">The State of Mobile Video 2015</a> : a little about how things are with mobile video. <br><br>  Culture News.  It turns out that fakapy are even in mature streamers.  So <a href="http://blog.streamingmedia.com/2015/02/oscars-webcast-technical-problems.html">ABC screwed up when broadcasting the Oscars</a> .  Poor quality, sudden switching to other programs - even the best of the best have failures. <br><br>  That's all for today.  Let's see what the woodpeckers will bring news agencies in March. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376955/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376955/</a></p>
