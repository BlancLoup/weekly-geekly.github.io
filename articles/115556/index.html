It was about the service of personal assistants, which: <ul><li>  I was looking for tinsmiths to pull an icicle from the roof of the Passat </li><li>  did a visa to Poland for 86 days </li><li>  in general, brightened life. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Since then, much has changed and the only service that existed at that time has completely deteriorated.  I corresponded with them for a long time.  He wrote ‚Äúnot in the order of accusations, but good advice to your business,‚Äù they assured me that they had taken measures, put them on special control - everything was useless: <br><ul><li>  when he asked for a ticket, he received the fare twice as high (as they found it - a mystery) </li><li>  found books for 20 rubles cheaper and took 600 rubles for the service </li><li>  pleased as they could. </li></ul><br><h4>  What to do </h4><br>  I found a Ukrainian company and asked me, Katsapa with a Ukrainian name, to be taken into customers.  As a Muscovite, I was given a special rate of $ 250 per month instead of $ 60. When asked why they said that they would have to hire a special employee, they would buy a desk and a computer.  At the bargaining did not go and disappeared.

      <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/twentytwo/" class="user_link">twentytwo</a> tried to find Indians, but they demanded 10 Russian-speaking clients.  So much we did not find. <br><br>  In general, my friend and I did a service for ourselves, they ran it in, and then screwed the interface.  Here it is: <a href="http://www.timeangel.ru/">TimeAngel</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/264/1c2/225/2641c22254106274cf94d9a5b30ffd56.png"><br><br><h4>  Happened </h4><ul><li>  <b>We have good assistants.</b>  Smart and intelligent.  We pay them a lot: or rather, as much as you say.  I will write about it separately. </li><li>  <b>We take only hourly.</b>  We are not trying, like some, to resell third-party services at exorbitant prices.  We charge for calling abroad at Skype rates.  Right? </li><li>  <b>We serve only you.</b>  We do not participate in any affiliate programs and do not cut interest on orders. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  It does not work yet </h4><ul><li>  <b>Do little urgent things</b> .  For example, do not call a taxi for the near future. </li><li>  <b>We do not accept orders by phone</b> , at least for now.  But you can send a voice note from Evernote. </li><li>  <b>With couriers while hard</b> .  Still looking for a courier company for orders around the city. </li></ul>  With the latest interesting.  We, probably, tried every conceivable bad courier: <br><ul><li>  Madman with snot under his nose </li><li>  One is missing and resets calls </li><li>  The third one disappeared and wrote a sms "do not call anymore" </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f06/00e/b69/f0600eb6981d07fb9beb2ddd1ae6d70c.jpg"><br><br>  Another one I recruited to <a href="http://workzilla.ru/">Workzilla</a> .  He was correct and professional, received 500 rubles for the service.  Next to our office there was a little Kroshka-Kartoshki lurek.  I left the office and saw him eating up the fee.  ‚ÄúI work for GRAT‚Äù.  I thanked him, gave the following instructions and offered constant cooperation, to which he informed me that he was a co-founder of Workzilla, tested the service on the side of the contractor and was not interested in my instructions.  The rest of the workzilla performers are unmanageable. <br><br><h4>  What did our assistants do? </h4><br>  Had time to be noted.  Here are some tasks <i>for me</i> (we don‚Äôt disclose clients): <ul><li>  Repaired the suitcases in the warranty service Samsonite </li><li>  We bought tickets to the Munich Opera when the reservation system broke down. </li><li>  Made a latch on the bedroom door </li><li>  Found Japanese courses, spare parts for air cleaner </li><li>  Sold MacBook </li><li>  Bought materials for the crown of snowflakes </li></ul>  We carefully collected a lot of real-life stories where personal assistants showed themselves in all their glory - <a href="http://www.timeangel.ru/stories">someone else's life, what could be more interesting?</a> <br><br><h4>  Nano innovation </h4><br>  <b>All tasks are evaluated by the client.</b>  For you, the price remains fixed (based on the hourly rate of 390 r / hour), but not for the operator.  You can reward him or fine him.  Why do we do this?  Thus, we motivate the operators with only one thing: <b>to make the customer satisfied</b> .  Customer satisfaction is that in other companies there is only on paper in the form of template "missions" and "strategies." <ul><li>  Is the seller interested in a percentage of sales to give you pleasure?  No, he is glad to sell you anything expensive. </li><li>  Is it interesting for an operator who is motivated to quickly serve customers to do a good job?  No, he needs faster, faster. </li></ul>  There are quite paradoxical cases: in the book ‚ÄúClients for Life‚Äù a case is described when pilots were rewarded for timely departure.  It seems that it should be to the benefit of passengers.  But as a result, people sat for four hours, it seemed, for hours on the plane and did not take off.  Cause?  Departures are measured according to the time of the landing exit, and not the actual takeoff. <br><br>  Therefore, we took and left only one parameter: keep client happy.  And they are ready to pay operators from their income: after all, for the client the price remains the same. <br><br>  <b>Examples of instructions</b> <br>  We wrote <a href="http://www.timeangel.ru/delegate">72 examples of instructions</a> .  Why did we do this?  People do not think out anything from their heads, from scratch.  Even when they are asked to name any two-digit number, 37 is most often called (it is not known why).  But they work great with lists: shopping lists, to-do lists, and so on.  We have a list of tasks: you run through it with your eyes and choose something that can be useful. <br><br><h4>  HELP </h4><br>  We did the service, it remains to find customers.  If you have any ideas for promotion, I will be glad to hear.  One thing is clear: there are no customers here at Habr√©  I wrote to those who positively evaluated the ideas of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/90369/">previous article</a> , no one needs a gift (and I offered it for a test for nothing).  Yandex.Direct is also not for us: no one is looking for this service.  If you have any thoughts mature, I promise to consider and respond.  And no - you'll have to think for yourself) <br><br>  Update November 2013: despite the fact that there are a million competitors, including the giant <a href="https://youdo.com/">YouDo</a> , the service is alive, although its function is largely to help with the projects of the <a href="http://www.visualpharm.ru/">core business</a> . <br><br>  Update November 2013: We started receiving calls and calls from the site. <br><br>  2016: the service has long since died, now we <a href="https://ru.icons8.com/">make icons</a> .  For example, a <a href="https://ru.icons8.com/web-app/15684/timer">timer</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115556/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115556/</a></p>
