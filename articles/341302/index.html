I will discuss them in more detail in the section of the article entitled ‚ÄúStrengths‚Äù. </p><br><p>  One of them is <strong>first-class support for competitiveness (concurrency)</strong> (using goroutines and channels, discussed below).  By definition, competitiveness makes it possible to more efficiently use all the available CPU power, even if the processor has only one core.  In Go, hundreds of thousands of gorutin (lightweight streams) can run simultaneously on a single machine.  Channels and gortines are extremely important when building distributed systems, since they abstract the mechanisms associated with message transfer as part of the supplier-consumer messaging paradigm concept. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Back in Go, I really like the interfaces.  <strong>Interfaces allow you to create a system based on loosely coupled or completely unrelated components.</strong>  Thus, your code can rely on the interface type, without particularly caring about who implements this interface and how.  The controller provides this code with a dependency corresponding to the interface (implementing all its functions).  This allows you to create a good architecture for unit testing (using dependency injection).  The controller can inject (inject) a simulation of the implementation of the interface required in the code, which will give an opportunity to test the correctness of its operation. </p><br><p>  Considering all these features, I think you can say that Go is a wonderful language, especially when it comes to developing cloud (web servers, CDN, caches, etc.) and distributed systems, microservices, etc. Therefore, if you Now thinking about the choice of language for the next project, I recommend to take a closer look at Go. </p><br><p>  In this article I plan to talk about the following aspects of the language: </p><br><ul><li>  Introduction </li><li>  Why needed Go. </li><li>  The target audience. </li><li>  Go strengths. </li><li>  Go weaknesses. </li><li>  Going to go 2. </li><li>  Go philosophy. </li><li>  Where to begin. </li><li>  Who uses Go. </li></ul><br><h2 id="vvedenie">  Introduction </h2><br><p>  Go is an open source language created by Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.  The openness of the source code in this case means that everyone can take part in the development of the language, making <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/ExperienceReports">suggestions</a> for developing new functions, correcting errors, etc. The language code is available on <a href="https://github.com/golang/go">GitHub</a> .  Documentation on participation in the development can be found <a href="https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html">here</a> . </p><br><h2 id="zachem-ponadobilsya-go">  Why Go </h2><br><p>  The authors say that the main reason for creating a new language was the desire to solve the problems arising in Google related to software development.  They also mention that Go was developed as an alternative to C ++. </p><br><p>  Here is what Rob Pike says about Go: </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúGoal's goal is not to conduct research in the field of programming language design;  it is to improve the working environment of its developers and their colleagues.  Go is more focused on software development than on programming language research.  Or, in other words, Go was designed to serve primarily development goals. ‚Äù </p><br><p>  <strong>Google's problems that pushed to create Go</strong> (taken from <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article">https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article</a> ): </p><br><ul><li>  slow build up to one hour </li><li>  uncontrollable dependencies </li><li>  programmers use different subsets of the language, </li><li>  difficulties in reading the code (problems with understanding programs written by other people, insufficient amount and quality of documentation, etc.), </li><li>  duplication of effort </li><li>  cost of updates </li><li>  version skew, </li><li>  difficulties in writing automation tools, </li><li>  interlanguage assemblies. </li></ul><br><p>  <strong>In order for Go to succeed, he must solve these problems</strong> (taken from <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article">https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article</a> ): </p><br><ul><li>  Go should work on a large scale, for large development teams, for programs with a large number of dependencies. </li><li>  Go should be familiar, relatively speaking, C-like.  Google needs programmers to quickly begin to work productively with the new language, so it should not be too radical. </li><li>  Go must be modern.  He needs opportunities such as competitiveness so that programmers can efficiently use multi-core machines.  It should have built-in libraries for working with the network and as a web server. </li></ul><br><h2 id="celevaya-auditoriya">  The target audience </h2><br><p>  Go is a language for creating systems.  It is great for cloud solutions (web servers, caches), microservices and distributed systems (at the expense of competitiveness). </p><br><h2 id="silnye-storony">  Strengths </h2><br><p>  <strong>Static typing</strong> </p><br><p>  Go is a static-typed language.  This means that already at the compilation stage it is necessary to declare the types of all variables, function arguments and return values.  This approach may seem inconvenient, but this is actually an advantage, since many errors will be found at compile time.  The importance of this factor grows with the size of the command, since type declaration makes libraries and functions more readable and better understood. </p><br><p>  <strong>Compilation speed</strong> </p><br><p> The code written in Go compiles <strong>very quickly</strong> , so you no longer need to wait for the compilation to end :) In fact, the <code>go run</code> command starts the program so quickly that at first it even seems that there was no compilation at all, as if we were working with an interpreted language. </p><br><p>  <strong>Execution speed</strong> </p><br><p>  The Go code is compiled directly into machine code, which depends on the operating system used (Linux / Windows / Mac) and the CPU architecture of the machine (x86, x86‚Äì64, ARM, etc.) on which the compilation is performed.  Therefore, Go-programs work really fast. </p><br><p>  <strong>Portability</strong> </p><br><p>  Since the program is compiled directly into machine code, binary files are portable within the same operating system and architecture. </p><br><p>  This possibility arises because Go binaries are statically linked, that is, all the necessary shared libraries are included in the binary file at the compilation stage.  Dynamically while the program is running, they are not linked. <br>  This is convenient when deploying programs on a large number of machines in the data center.  The binary can be simply copied (for example, using <code>scp</code> ) to any number of machines, if, of course, it was compiled for the OS and the architecture of the target system.  You do not need to care about the installed version of Linux and manage dependencies.  The program just starts and works :) </p><br><p>  <strong>Competitiveness</strong> </p><br><p>  Go provides high-quality support for competitiveness, which is one of the most important advantages of this programming language.  Go's competitiveness implementation mechanisms are based on Tony Hoare's <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Hoare78.pdf">'Communicating Sequential Processes'</a> . </p><br><p>  <strong>Go Runtime allows you to perform hundreds of thousands of competitive gorutin on a single machine.</strong>  Gorutina is a lightweight flow of execution.  Go can multiplex gorutiny in OS threads.  That is, several gorutin can competitively run in the same thread of the operating system.  In the Go runtime, there is a special scheduler whose task is to control the execution of the gorutin. </p><br><p>  There are two advantages to this approach: </p><br><ol><li><p>  When initializing, the gorutin takes up only 4 KB in the stack.  This is minuscule compared to, for example, 1 megabyte, which is usually allocated to the operating system stream.  This number becomes important when it is necessary to perform competitively hundreds of thousands of different gorutin on one machine.  If you use OS threads for these purposes, RAM can run out very quickly. </p><br></li><li>  Go could follow the same path as other languages, such as Java, which uses operating system threads.  However, in this case, the price of context switching between OS threads is much higher compared to the price of context switching between different Gortutins. </li></ol><br><p>  Since I have repeatedly mentioned ‚Äúcompetitiveness‚Äù in this article, I recommend watching a video in which Rob Pike says that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DcN_DpYBzKso">competitiveness and parallelism are two different things</a> .  In programming, competitiveness means a set of independently running processes, while as parallelism is the simultaneous execution of independent and / or dependent calculations.  On one core, parallelism is not available, since it can perform only one operation per unit of time.  However, competition in this case is still possible.  The operating system scheduler runs different processes (actually, threads, since each process has at least the main thread) in different time slices.  Thus, in a unit of time, the processor is occupied by only one thread.  Due to the high speed of operations, it seems to us that several programs are simultaneously running.  But in fact all pass one by one. </p><br><p>  <strong>Competition allows you to deal with several things at once, and concurrency allows you to do several things at once.</strong> </p><br><p>  <strong>Interfaces</strong> </p><br><p>  Interfaces allow you to create loosely coupled systems.  In Go, an interface type can be defined as a set of functions.  And it's all.  Any type that implements these functions implicitly implements an interface, that is, you do not need to specify that your type implements a specific interface.  This will make the compiler at compile time. </p><br><p>  Thus, your code can rely on the interface type, without particularly caring about who implements this interface and how.  The controller provides this code with a dependency corresponding to the interface (implementing all its functions).  This allows you to create a good architecture for unit testing (using dependency injection).  The controller can inject (inject) a simulation of the implementation of the interface required in the code, which will give an opportunity to test the correctness of its operation. </p><br><p>  Here there is an advantage from the point of view of microservice architecture.  If your application is hosted on one server (at the beginning of the project), you design it in such a way that its functions are performed by different microservices, each of which implements its own interface.  Thus, other services / controllers invoke interface methods without worrying about how they are implemented internally. </p><br><p>  <strong>Garbage collection</strong> </p><br><p>  Unlike C, Go does not need to free up dynamically allocated memory and worry about dangling pointers.  The garbage collector will take care of them. </p><br><p>  <strong>No exceptions</strong> </p><br><p>  Handle errors yourself.  I am very pleased with the fact that Go, unlike many other languages, does not have a standard mechanism for dealing with exceptions.  Developers here have to independently handle errors like 'couldn't open file' - there is no possibility to wrap the code in a <code>try catch</code> .  That is, programmers are encouraged to think about how these errors should be properly processed. </p><br><p>  <strong>Wonderful toolkit</strong> </p><br><p>  One of the most enjoyable sides of Go is its tools: </p><br><ul><li><p>  <a href="https://blog.golang.org/go-fmt-your-code">Gofmt</a> automatically formats the code and indents.  This can ensure that the Go code looks the same for all developers without exception writing in this language, thus significantly improving the readability of the code. </p><br></li><li><p>  <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/">Go run</a> compiles and executes code.  Yes, Go programs need to be compiled, but this happens so quickly that there is a feeling of working with the interpreted language. </p><br></li><li><p>  <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/">Go get</a> loads the library from GitHub and copies it to GoPath, after which it can be imported into the project. </p><br></li><li>  <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc">Godoc</a> parses the source code on Go, including comments, and issues output documentation in plain text or HTML format.  The godoc web interface allows you to see together the documentation and code, where, for example, from the documentation on the function to its implementation you can go in one click. </li></ul><br><p>  These and other tools can be found <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/">here</a> . </p><br><p>  <strong>Remarkable built-in libraries</strong> </p><br><p>  Go‚Äôs has the following built-in libraries that are designed to make the life of a modern developer easier: </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="http/">net / http</a> provides implementations of the HTTP client and server </li><li>  <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/">database / sql is</a> designed to interact with SQL databases, </li><li>  <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/">encoding / json</a> provides first-class support for JSON, </li><li>  <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/">html / templates</a> - library for working with HTML-templates, </li><li>  <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/io/ioutil/">io / ioutil</a> are helper I / O functions. </li></ul><br><p>  Libraries and frameworks for all kinds of usage scenarios can be found <a href="https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go">here</a> . </p><br><h2 id="slabosti">  Weakness </h2><br><p>  <strong>Lack of generics</strong> </p><br><p>  Generics allow you to create algorithms using types that will be specified later.  Suppose you need to write a function to sort the integers.  Then you needed a function to sort the list of strings.  At this point, you understand that the code of these functions will be almost the same, but you cannot use the first function, because it takes a list of integers as an argument and refuses to receive a list of strings.  Nothing can be done, you will have to duplicate the code.  If the generics were in Go, you could write a function to sort the list of elements of type T and call the same function for integers, strings, and any other types for which there is an ordering function.  That is, the compiler must be able to compare values ‚Äã‚Äãof this type. </p><br><p>  In Go, it is possible to do something similar to a generic using an empty interface (interface).  But this decision is not without flaws. </p><br><p>  Generics - a very controversial topic.  There are programmers who pray for them when others do not want to include generics in the language, since they represent a compromise between compile time and program execution time. </p><br><p>  The creators of Go say they are open to dialogue about the implementation of the generics mechanism in Go.  But it's not just generics.  They can be implemented in the language only if they interact well with its other components.  Let's wait for Go 2 and see if there is any solution to this problem. </p><br><p>  <strong>Lack of dependency management</strong> </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúGo 1 promise‚Äù (Go 1 promise) allows you to be sure that Go itself and its libraries will not change their API during Go 1 life. Your code must be compiled in Go 1.5 and Go 1.9.  Most third-party libraries follow this promise.  Since you are downloading third-party libraries from GitHub using <code>go get</code> by executing <code>go get github.com/vendor/library</code> , you can only hope that there is no change in the API in the newest code in the master branch.  For rare third-party projects, this is not so bad, since most libraries hold the word, but for production the option is not the best. </p><br><p>  Ideally, you need some kind of versioning of dependencies, in which you could specify the version number of the third-party library in the dependency file.  In this case, you will not have to worry about changing the API, as this will not affect the version you are using.  Later it will be possible to study the differences and decide on the transition to the new version, make the appropriate changes in your code, if necessary, and indicate the new version number in the dependency file. </p><br><p>  Go runs an official experiment called <a href="https://github.com/golang/dep">dep</a> , which I hope will solve this problem.  Perhaps this will happen in Go 2 :) </p><br><h2 id="dvizhemsya-k-go-2">  Going to go 2 </h2><br><p>  I really like the open source approach to creating a language that we see in Go.  If you want the functionality you need to be implemented in Go 2, issue the following document: </p><br><ul><li>  Description of the use case. </li><li>  Description of the inability to solve the problem using the tools currently available in the language. </li><li>  Characterization of the seriousness of the problem (some things are not so important as to put them in priority). </li><li>  Solution option (optional). </li></ul><br><p>  The authors will review the proposal and render their verdict.  Discussions on these issues are held publicly in mailing lists and issue trackers. </p><br><p>  In my opinion, the two most serious problems of Go are generics and dependency management.  Dependency management is more concerned with working with releases or selecting tools.  I hope that <a href="https://github.com/golang/dep">dep</a> will be the official solution to this problem.  Considering that the authors speak about the openness of their position in relation to generics, I am very curious how they are going to implement them, since generics will inevitably increase either the compile time or the execution time. </p><br><h2 id="filosofiya-go">  Go philosophy </h2><br><p>  I want to quote here the most memorable quotes from Rob Pike‚Äôs presentation titled <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2015/simplicity-is-complicated.slide">Simplicity is Complicated</a> . </p><br><ul><li><p>  <strong>Traditionally, programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãfollow the path of increasing functionality.</strong>  Thus, they constantly inflate and complicate their compilers and specifications.  If this continues in the future, in the future all languages ‚Äã‚Äãwill become almost the same.  A good example is adding OOP in javascript.  Many things were intentionally not included in Go by its authors.  <strong>Only that functionality was implemented, with respect to which there was a unity of opinions of the authors of the language, those possibilities that really increased the Go utility.</strong> </p><br></li><li><p>  <strong>Elements of functionality resemble orthogonal vectors in a solution space.</strong>  The ability to choose the appropriate vectors for your case is important.  <strong>Selected vectors should easily interact with each other, that is, all elements of the language functionality should fit in a predictable way.</strong>  A complete set of language functionality elements covers the entire solution space.  Implementing all sorts of features, given the need for their seamless interaction, brings additional complexity to languages.  However, language abstracts complexity by providing interfaces that are simple and easy to understand.  Thus, simplicity is the art of hiding complexity :) </p><br></li><li>  <strong>The importance of readability is often underestimated.</strong>  Readability is critical.  Perhaps this is the most important thing in language design, since the need and cost of software support is also very important.  Too many features hurt readability. </li></ul><br><p>  <strong>Readability also means reliability.</strong>  If the complexity of the language is high, you need more knowledge and effort to read the code and work with it, including debugging and patching.  It also means that beginners will have to spend more time to bring their understanding of the language to a level where they can begin to contribute to the development of the code base. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ef/92/59ef922841974673119208.png"><br><p>  Taken from <a href="https://blog.digitalocean.com/get-your-development-team-started-with-go/">https://blog.digitalocean.com/get-your-development-team-started-with-go/</a> </p><br><h2 id="s-chego-nachat">  Where to begin </h2><br><p>  The Go distribution and installation instructions can be found <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">here</a> . </p><br><p>  Here is the <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">official</a> getting <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">started guide</a> .
