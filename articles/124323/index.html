    <h4>  Organization </h4><br><br>  The meeting took place in the ITMO-based <a href="http://qd.ifmo.ru/">QD business incubator</a> , which is located on the VO stock exchange line.  After the checkpoint, where the aunt on duty wrote us all to the journal, we through the spiral staircase and the catacombs of the corridors of the incubator finally reached the conference hall where the meeting took place. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5df87bd8/ec59b0e9/9383a7b3/651044ff.jpg"><br>  There were more people than the organizers expected - about 60 people, but everything was located quite comfortably.  The situation was absolutely pleasant - dozens of like-minded people in the field of information services of different ages, from schoolchildren to adult husbands, and as many as 4 (!) Girls chatted gently before the meeting began. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d6991bfb/790403f3/b1228e7c/a7a307f5.jpg"><br>  After the opening speech of the organizers in the person of <a href="https://twitter.com/asintsov">Alexey Sintsov</a> , the scheduled reports began. <br><br><h4>  Reports </h4><br><h5>  Hardware virtualization and malware </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f43c4279/df03abee/b0234f3b/9e2e5efa.jpg"><br>  The report of my friend Nikita <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ntkt/" class="user_link">Abdulin</a> ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ntkt/" class="user_link">ntkt</a> ) about virtualization opened the meeting.  He spoke about what it is all about, why it is needed, how ‚ÄúHardware Virtualization‚Äù differs from ‚ÄúHardware-based Virtualization‚Äù and considered issues related to the security of this topic.  The report was, frankly, not the easiest and easiest - Nikita patiently told him for almost an hour - but the public still had questions.  After the report, I saw how two people approached him, who with him strenuously rubbed something on his subject.  In general, the report found its public. <br><br><h5>  Bitcoin decentralized cryptocurrency </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d1c56ff3/385d68c1/c8380f69/882bebfa.jpg"><br>  The next report (again, my friend :-) Pasha Ershov about bitcoin cryptocurrency caused a heated discussion.  After a brief story about what it is and who needs it, Pasha was forced to talk about what the salt itself is, i.e.  delve into the bitcoin cryptographic side.  He spoke about his own experience (45 kilorubles for 2 months).  Then they discussed for a very long time why the last bitcoin will be generated in 2030, why the value drops and why nothing is known about the author of the system.  I think I was not the only one who then visited thoughts from the category of conspiracy theories that bitcoin was done exclusively for breaking sha256 under the guise of some kind of currency. <br><br><h5>  MacOS X - protects the core and attacks on it </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0d725452/95d7a887/caa8f53b/aa6b615d.jpg"><br>  The report is from a fairly well-known person in the InfoBez circles - Nikita Tarakanov, who came from Moscow by car for the meeting.  In the report, the author reviewed Mac OS X from an architectural point of view and spoke about the problems that arise when searching for and operating vulnerabilities in this OS.  For a number of questions, Nikita promised more details on the upcoming Chaos Construction 2011, so come. <br><br><h5>  Lockpicking for newbies </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ac4e1659/079bcabe/1708e1d6/998d52f6.jpg"><br>  The latest report from Alexander Polyakov, also a fairly famous person, about hacking (IRL) locks.  Lockpicking or in Russian ‚Äúbearishness‚Äù is quite popular at international hacker conferences and in order to keep up with its colleagues, the author told us the basics on this topic.  A very cheerful and lively report, after which a <s>wave of thefts swept over St. Petersburg,</s> anyone could try themselves in this matter. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1f18020c/76f94a17/06da84f9/9da19cf9.jpg"><br>  At this second meeting of the DEFCON group in St. Petersburg was completed. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  In conclusion, I would like to say that the organizers fulfilled their goal, namely the creation of a community of people involved in information security.  This is only the second meeting, but several dozens of people have already gathered who are interested, lively participate in discussions and generally do their best to promote the prosperity of this topic in a single St. Petersburg. <br><br>  I look forward to the next meeting. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : Slides - <a href="http://www.defcon-russia.ru/second/">www.defcon-russia.ru/second</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124323/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124323/</a></p>
