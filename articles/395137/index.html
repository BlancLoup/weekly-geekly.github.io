The exchange, and in particular the stock market, is an affordable way to obtain an additional source of income. <br><br>  In order to conduct operations with various financial instruments - currency, stocks, bonds, precious metals, options, futures - first of all you need to open a brokerage account.  If earlier, to open an account, it was necessary to have a personal presence at the broker's office, now you can open a brokerage account remotely, for this you only need access to the Internet.

      In today's material, we will look at the purposes for which you need to open a brokerage account, and present you with comprehensive instructions on how to do this through public services. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Why maybe you need a brokerage account: using IIS </h4><br>  From January 1, 2015 in Russia there is the possibility of opening the so-called individual investment accounts - IIS. <br><br>  IIS is a brokerage account that gives its owner the right to tax benefits.  Benefits are divided into two types.  The first type of exemption - a tax deduction of 13% of the amount paid - is suitable for people who are not going to try themselves as active investors.  The benefit of the second type is designed for those people who not only put money on IIS, but also actively use them to invest in bonds, securities, currency and other financial instruments.  We <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/itinvest/blog/246972/">talked</a> about this tool in more detail earlier, and today we‚Äôll go through its capabilities briefly. <br><br>  Today, according to VTsIOM, Russians <a href="http://studydoc.ru/doc/669783/iisx">consider</a> opening deposits in banks <a href="http://studydoc.ru/doc/669783/iisx">as the</a> most reliable means of increasing capital.  However, the difficult situation that has developed within the country's banking system (over the past year, the number of operating credit institutions decreased from 834 at the beginning of 2015 to 733 at the beginning of 2016, which represents 12% of the total number of Russian banks), actualizes the opening of IIS as a way of preserving and multiplying capital. <br><br>  In fact, IIS is a kind of alternative to a bank deposit.  IIS is a new opportunity to receive income from investments by returning a part of the funds in the form of a tax deduction.  The owner of an investment account can invest in federal loan bonds, buy currencies at a stock exchange at a more favorable rate than the one offered by the exchangers, and also buy shares of Russian and foreign companies. <br><br><h4>  What else do you need a brokerage account </h4><br>  In addition to receiving tax benefits through IIS, a brokerage account can be used to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/itinvest/blog/234149/">buy and sell currencies on the Moscow Exchange</a> .  The exchange in this aspect can provide more favorable conditions than banks, since the rate set by a bank to buy and sell differs from the official rate of the Bank of Russia and the exchange rate of a particular currency.  In addition to the favorable exchange rate, there are other advantages of using a brokerage account for buying and selling currencies.  These include security, convenience and freedom from taxation when carrying out transfer operations (in the event that the amount was transferred to a brokerage account for its conversion into a currency, and then this currency was withdrawn - without profit). <br><br>  Buying and selling precious metals can be another tool for working in the stock market (we wrote about <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/itinvest/blog/228347/">this investment method</a> in detail <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/itinvest/blog/228347/">earlier</a> ).  Anyone who has opened a brokerage account can begin to buy and sell non-cash gold and silver on the main Russian stock exchange, the Moscow Stock Exchange.  The stock exchange is buying and selling gold and silver in a couple of clicks in the trading terminal, whereas in ordinary life it is a rather complicated and long procedure. <br><br><h4>  It's simple: How to open a brokerage account remotely </h4><br>  Recently, opening a brokerage account is much easier than a bank deposit.  This does not even require a personal presence.  You can open a brokerage account remotely, without leaving your home. <br><br>  In order to open a brokerage account, just use one of the following methods: <br><br><ol><li>  Get a verified account on the website of state services; </li><li>  Fill out an application for opening a brokerage account online <a href="http://www.itinvest.ru/services/open-account-online/">on the ITinvest website</a> . </li></ol><br>  Let us dwell on each of the methods of opening a brokerage account. <br><br><h5>  Method 1 (for those who do not have an account on the state services) </h5><br>  What you need: <br><br><ul><li>  passport (passport information required); </li><li>  insurance certificate of compulsory pension insurance (SNILS, its eleven-digit number); </li><li>  mobile phone or email. </li></ul><br>  What you need to do: <br><br><ol><li>  To register on the website of <a href="https://esia.gosuslugi.ru/">public services</a> .

Fill out the documents are not required, for this will be used the data obtained from the portal of public services. </li><li>  Follow the link in the email sent to the specified email address. </li></ol><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  The procedure for opening a brokerage account is simplified to a couple of clicks.  For this, personal presence at the broker‚Äôs office or notary visit is no longer required.  In the presence of a confirmed account on the portal of state services, the whole process of opening a brokerage account will take no more than 15 minutes.  The opportunity to make money and make deals will appear the next day.  The remote opening of a brokerage account makes the stock market accessible to everyone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395137/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395137/</a></p>
