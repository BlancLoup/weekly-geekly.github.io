I will call these dependencies relationships.  They can be combined into different groups: <ul><li>  Link / Property </li><li>  Interaction / Contact </li><li>  Removal / Transfer </li></ul><br><br>  Relationships of each group can go into the remaining two.

    <h4>  Link / Property </h4><br>  This is the most pronounced phenomenon in the properties of the information environment.  Example: A child has a relationship with his father.  The father is in another part of the galaxy.  The father died, the child instantly became an orphan. <br><br>  Communication is a relationship that determines a person‚Äôs position in the world.  Do you know the phrase ‚Äútell me what world we are in‚Äù? <br><br>  The connection is revealed through the definition of the absence of any property.  If this ‚Äúlack of property‚Äù cannot be identified, the connection is in a destroyed state.  When a property manifests itself or its absence becomes apparent, then the connection is considered restored. <br><br>  In the 15th century, it was impossible not to be an SEO specialist or a train engineer, but one could not be a postman or a butcher.  On the other hand, today rarely anyone thinks that he can not be the keeper of the pen at the royal court. <br><br><h4>  Interaction / Contact </h4><br>  The existence of an interaction requires the existence of two entities.  If the entity has a reflection, then one is enough (the case when you can talk to yourself).  This includes all human relationships - communication, togetherness, emotions - and, moreover, all physical contacts.  It is logical to assume that this will include memories of the past, fantasies, as well as planning and forecasting the future. <br><br>  For example, I touch the table, I see the table, during these processes I get information about the table.  I imagine a table, I model a table, I get information about an imaginary table.  Whether the table correspond to each other in reality and my imaginary table does not matter for the existence of the interaction. <br><br><h4>  Removal / Transfer </h4><br>  The most difficult and most valuable group of relationships.  To remove something means to have in oneself the properties characteristic of another entity, which become part of the subject after contact with this entity.  Example: I bought a mug with a pen, you can pour water into it.  This mug contains in the removed form, at a minimum: the properties of the human hand (the handle of the mug is needed to hold it with a hand), as well as the properties of water (through the leaky bottom it would spill) and the properties of reality in which it will be used (on the moon this mug should be, for example, high so that water does not spill over). <br><br><h5>  How to separate the wheat from the chaff? </h5><br>  Big example: I painted a picture.  I'm a boring artist, I decided to paint the world the way I see it.  He went out, looked at something nice to the eye, put an easel and painted.  This picture was stolen from me and sent by mail.  She fell into the hands of an evil worker, he did not like the picture, he tore it up and sent it to the addressee.  The collector received a torn, boring picture and hung it on the wall.  A collector's friend came and bought a picture.  Brought home and burned it in the fireplace. <br><br>  Example analysis  I'm a boring artist.  But it‚Äôs boring not because I draw badly, but because I draw boring (ordinary) things.  I took a boring and ordinary part of myself into the picture.  The result was a boring picture.  The picture was stolen.  Now this picture is a stolen, boring picture.  Then she became torn.  The picture now contains in the removed form the features of at least three people.  The collector made this picture a valuable stolen boring ripped picture.  A friend of the collector made her ideological non-existent / inaccessible valued stolen boring torn picture. <br><br>  Determine by a handful of ashes that it is no longer possible.  But you can try to highlight the properties and say in what ways they are involved. <br><ul><li>  Boring - removes the artist. </li><li>  A kidnapping is a connection / property, which shows that the picture belongs to another by right.  If the thief comes to the artist and pays for it, then it will cease to be stolen. </li><li>  Ragged - removes the aversion of the postman to the usual. </li><li>  Appreciating - perhaps the picture no longer possesses this property, but earlier it participated in a very complex connection. </li><li>  Inaccessible / non-existent - participates in an interaction / contact and communication / property relationship.  Perhaps removes the features of a friend collector. </li><li>  Ideological - removes some features of a friend of the collector. </li></ul><h4>  Why all this? </h4><br>  Each of these categories is an aggressive or passive source of information.  Relationships removed store information about the environment in which they were created.  Analyzing the removed relationships and properties generated by them, you can explore competitors, the market, use someone else's experience.  The withdrawal study is a very powerful source of information that does not impersonate itself, since you do not come into contact with the information carrier, but with the entities with which it interacts. <br><br><h5>  Strengths of the withdrawal analysis </h5><br>  Programmers and engineers around the world use similar methods, calling them dirty.  Not least, this is due to the fact that the information is simply stolen and does not reasonably adapt to the new environment. <br>  But the analysis of the withdrawal may be the only way to extract someone else's experience in conditions where it is not possible to establish contact with the carrier of this experience. <br><br>  Analysis of withdrawals with a reasonable approach (not copying) can also provide information on the results of expensive research, market trends and customer preferences. <br><br><h5>  Disadvantages of withdrawal analysis </h5><br>  The accuracy of the analysis increases with the increase of the analyzed withdrawals.  Those.  At the initial stages, the analysis may provide little useful or even unreliable data. <br><br>  PS: In the future, I will show you how you can find out the opinion of prominent programmers on a specific issue without asking them about it.  For these purposes, we will analyze the code from GitHub. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142030/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142030/</a></p>
