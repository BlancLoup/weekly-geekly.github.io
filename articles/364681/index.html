He made a name for himself as a promoter of space issues not only on Habr√© and Hiktayms, but also in social networks.  But what is there, perhaps, the Green Cat is now one of the most active spaceblogger in runet.  Vitaly has a very large list of twitter blogs, from where he gets all sorts of information about space.  Of these, he chose the most interesting, in his opinion, and gave his comments.  So everyone who wants to delve into the space theme can adopt a selection of links from the Green Cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ISRO's Mars Orbiter ( <a href="https://twitter.com/MarsOrbiter">MarsOrbiter</a> ).  This is an Indian satellite on Mars.  Here photos appear earlier than on the site.  Once the authors of this blog had a very interesting project - a ridiculous dialogue of their companion with the Twitter rover Curiosity.  The companion writes: ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm flying over there,‚Äù and Curiosity responded: ‚ÄúYes, yes, I‚Äôm just waiting.‚Äù <br><br>  New Scientist ( <a href="https://twitter.com/newscientist">newscientist</a> ).  There are published quite serious scientific texts and press releases on various news.

      <br>
      SHERLOC to Mars ( <a href="https://twitter.com/SHERLOC2020">SHERLOC2020</a> ).  This is a Twitter dedicated to the instruments on the rover, which will fly only in 2020.  Maybe it will be interesting, but so far no content is spread, only some NASA materials repost. <br><br>  SpaceNews ( <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceNews_Inc">SpaceNews_Inc</a> ).  Astronautics news portal.  All interesting, connected with launches, with satellites, a lot of commercial news of such a plan. <br><br>  Smithsonian Magazine ( <a href="https://twitter.com/SmithsonianMag">SmithsonianMag</a> ).  A lot of scientific news, sometimes slips something interesting on the space theme. <br><br>  SciencePorn ( <a href="https://twitter.com/SciencePorn">SciencePorn</a> ).  Here, too, interesting things appear, but a lot of non-space.  More jokes, caricatures, but sometimes something valuable happens, although rarely enough. <br><br>  UK Space Agency ( <a href="https://twitter.com/spacegovuk">spacegovuk</a> ).  The British make the rover program ExoMars.  Sometimes something interesting is published, but also quite rarely. <br><br>  VMC - Mars Webcam ( <a href="https://twitter.com/esamarswebcam">esamarswebcam</a> ).  The camera of a European satellite in Mars orbit.  She shoots with low resolution, but all of Mars.  Periodically does not work. <br><br>  ESO ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ESO">ESO</a> ).  They do a lot of interesting things, issue press releases every month, including in Russian.  I would recommend to subscribe to their mailing list by mail, rather than via Twitter. <br><br>  Damia Bouic ( <a href="https://twitter.com/db_prods">db_prods</a> ).  An amateur astronomer, sometimes he has beautiful pictures. <br><br>  Skybox Imaging ( <a href="https://twitter.com/skyboximaging">skyboximaging</a> ).  They shoot the Earth and make very beautiful videos from orbit in high resolution, up to one meter.  This is the only such satellite.  You can see cars driving on roads, ships sailing, planes landing.  The satellite is in low Earth orbit. <br><br>  ESA Rosetta Mission ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ESA_Rosetta">ESA_Rosetta</a> ).  Spacecraft Rosette.  Recommend. <br><br>  ESA Science ( <a href="https://twitter.com/esascience">esascience</a> ).  Occasionally publish materials on Mars. <br><br>  ESA Gaia ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ESAGaia">ESAGaia</a> ).  Telescope, but so far in operation, and there is little news. <br><br>  Dauria Aerospace (Dauria Aerospace).  Russian private company.  News appears rarely, but if the topic of the development of Russian private space is interesting, then you can subscribe. <br><br>  Morpheus Lander ( <a href="https://twitter.com/MorpheusLander">MorpheusLander</a> ).  The NASA project, sometimes they have interesting flights, learn to take off and land on various celestial bodies - in this case they train on Earth.  They rarely release videos, about every six months, but curious videos.  About a year ago there was a very beautiful video about how their apparatus fell and exploded.  And about four months ago they uploaded a video about how he sits on a rough terrain, at night, automatically (tested his autonomous control system). <br><br>  NewHorizons2015 ( <a href="https://twitter.com/NewHorizons2015">NewHorizons2015</a> ).  So far they haven‚Äôt removed anything, but have recently woken up, and soon it will be one of the most famous and interesting scientific programs.  I am sure that will overtake Rosette in popularity.  The device will fly past Pluto and periodically upload photos of the planet, each one will be more interesting than the previous one. <br><br>  Electro-L ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ka_electrol">ka_electrol</a> ).  Previously, every day there was laid out one photo from the satellite Electro-L.  The companion did not work all autumn and summer and did not publish anything, but now they will start again. <br><br>  ESA EarthObservation ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ESA_EO">ESA_EO</a> ).  Sometimes interesting, but more on the amateur.  Most often they make a video in the style of the weather forecast: in the background is some kind of image and the girl talks about something.  Not very dynamic and not very interesting. <br><br>  EUMETSAT ( <a href="https://twitter.com/eumetsat">eumetsat</a> ).  European meteorological satellite.  As I recall, they even have several satellites.  Sometimes they post interesting things, but they are also quite rare. <br><br>  Ted Stryk ( <a href="https://twitter.com/tedstryk">tedstryk</a> ).  Scientist and amateur astronomer, processes images from Mars and Venus.  He processed the Soviet photographs from Venus in such a way that they were even better for him.  On his website you can find pictures from Soviet spacecraft that you cannot find on any Russian website. <br><br>  HiRISE Russia ( <a href="https://twitter.com/HiRISERussian">HiRISERussian</a> ).  The satellite that shoots Mars with the highest resolution currently available. <br><br>  SpaceRef ( <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceRef">SpaceRef</a> ).  They write in sufficient detail about space, but more about astronautics, a lot of news about space business.  Again, this is interesting for those who like ‚Äúpieces of iron‚Äù, launches, launches, news about satellites and the like. <br><br>  Mars Weather ( <a href="https://twitter.com/MarsWxReport">MarsWxReport</a> ).  Previously published data from Curiosity weather sensors, but in recent years do not update the information.  Either money is not allocated, or the device itself is broken ... <br><br>  Sky &amp; Telescope ( <a href="https://twitter.com/SkyandTelescope">SkyandTelescope</a> ).  Astronomical Journal.  Basically publish what can be found in other sources. <br><br>  Astronomy Magazine ( <a href="https://twitter.com/AstronomyMag">AstronomyMag</a> ).  Same.  Maybe they write a little more and more interesting. <br><br>  Titan Saturn's Moon ( <a href="https://twitter.com/TitanSaturnMoon">TitanSaturnMoon</a> ).  Sometimes makes interesting repost about Saturn or about Titan, but for the most part not relevant, not news, but about what they did before. <br><br>  Fragile Oasis ( <a href="https://twitter.com/FragileOasis">FragileOasis</a> ).  For the most part, they publish photos of astronauts and do not indicate sources who took them and when.  For lovers of cosmic beauty is suitable, but as a source of information - so-so. <br><br>  Philae Lander ( <a href="https://twitter.com/Philae2014">Philae2014</a> ).  It is not clear whether he will wake up or not, but it is worth signing up.  Suddenly it will happen. <br><br>  Portal to Universe ( <a href="https://twitter.com/PTTU">PTTU</a> ).  For the most part repost, but quite interesting news.  You can see. <br><br>  Air &amp; Space Magazine ( <a href="https://twitter.com/airspacemag">airspacemag</a> ).  Interesting for zhelezyachnikov.  They write little, but interesting things skip. <br><br>  RedOrbit ( <a href="https://twitter.com/redorbit">redorbit</a> ).  News portal, a lot of space news, but without something unique. <br><br>  The Sun Today ( <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSunToday">TheSunToday</a> ).  The guys are watching the sun on NASA satellites, lovers.  Irregularly publish warnings of solar storms or comet spans past the sun. <br><br>  RuScience ( <a href="https://twitter.com/riascience">riascience</a> ).  Former Twitter RIA News.  The employee who led him after the reorganization of RIA Novosti quit, but the account remained with him.  He continues to write about the news, and sometimes it does it fairly quickly.  In Russian, on Twitter is almost one of the main sources of scientific and space news. <br><br>  Phil Plait ( <a href="https://twitter.com/BadAstronomer">BadAstronomer</a> ).  Better known as the Bad Astronomer.  In essence, the Green Cat is a Russian Phil Plate.  Incredibly productive, you need two Green Cat to write in the same mode as Phil Plate writes.  He has almost every day on the post, and the posts are interesting, informative.  Astrophysicist by education.  Sometimes it goes too far into mathematics, but for the most part its posts are understandable for everyone (but in English). <br><br>  NOAA ( <a href="https://twitter.com/NOAA">NOAA</a> ).  The American Meteorological Organization also sometimes publishes interesting things, but quite rarely, for the most part information noise. <br><br>  Chris Hadfield ( <a href="https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield">Cmdr_Hadfield</a> ).  The astronaut who in nearly three months in orbit gained almost a million followers on Twitter is very interesting.  Now he is no longer in orbit, but he publishes something old from his archive, pictures, promotes his book, and is mainly engaged in social activities.  On the fan. <br><br>  NASA HQ Photo ( <a href="https://twitter.com/nasahqphoto">nasahqphoto</a> ).  It is interesting for lovers of beautiful pictures, but you can subscribe to the main <a href="https://twitter.com/NASA">NASA</a> portal, there is an abundance of all the news there. <br><br>  Minor Planet Center ( <a href="https://twitter.com/MinorPlanetCtr">MinorPlanetCtr</a> ).  Very interesting application for paranoids.  Recently, the news was: Russian astronomers saw an asteroid that threatens Earth.  In fact, such asteroids are discovered almost every week, it is just not done by Russian astronomers, therefore, they don‚Äôt write about it in Russia.  The Minor Planet Center has an internal measure of the distance at which an asteroid flies past - LD (Lunar Distance, distance to the Moon).  For example, 15 LD - far, uninteresting.  And if zero as some LD is already interesting.  And in some cases, they give another kT (kilotons) - data on how much power will the explosion if the asteroid falls to the Earth. <br><br>  Astrobiology ( <a href="https://twitter.com/astrobiology">astrobiology</a> ).  Live twitter, for the most part repost on astrobiology, about the search for life outside the Earth.  About Antarctic research they write a lot. <br><br>  Free space ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ruspacelive">ruspacelive</a> ).  It's mine.  Rarely I post there posts, because there is simply no time. <br><br>  MoonSociety ( <a href="https://twitter.com/MoonSociety">MoonSociety</a> ).  They had a program to restore images from the moon, which Moon Prospector did in the 1970s.  The pictures were of a high enough quality, and they were restored, digitized.  Now almost nothing is written. <br><br>  SPACE.com ( <a href="https://twitter.com/SPACEdotcom">SPACEdotcom</a> ).  One of the main space media, many interesting things are written.  They have their own approach to the news, which I do not always like.  If to compare, SpaceRef writes more interestingly, than Space.com. <br><br>  Masten Space Systems ( <a href="https://twitter.com/mastenspace">mastenspace</a> ).  Those who make Morpheus, and they have their own designs of vehicles.  They have not yet flown to space, but are developing rocket vehicles.  News is rare, but interesting. <br><br>  Deep Space Industries ( <a href="https://twitter.com/GoDeepSpace">GoDeepSpace</a> ).  Startup for the extraction of minerals on asteroids.  They made a beautiful appearance, laid out beautiful pictures and animation, and while silence.  But something probably will, because they have not died, they do something and will do it, so you can sign with hope for the future. <br><br>  Virgin Galactic ( <a href="https://twitter.com/virgingalactic">virgingalactic</a> ).  Famous space tourism project. <br><br>  Planetary Resources ( <a href="https://twitter.com/PlanetaryRsrcs">PlanetaryRsrcs</a> ).  The first startup who was going to extract space resources on asteroids.  The following year, they launch their telescope, collect money on Kickstarter.  As long as they do not have enough news, they do not seem to repost strangers. <br><br>  Bob King ( <a href="https://twitter.com/AstroBob_bk">AstroBob_bk</a> ).  Astrobob, writes about astronomy infrequently (about once every two weeks), but interesting. <br><br>  Mars One ( <a href="https://twitter.com/MarsOneProject">MarsOneProject</a> ).  Blog famous project.  You can subscribe. <br><br>  NASA JPL ( <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL">NASAJPL</a> ).  The guys who run almost all the interplanetary vehicles that collected them and launched. <br><br>  NASA's MAVEN Mission ( <a href="https://twitter.com/MAVEN2Mars">MAVEN2Mars</a> ).  A satellite studying the atmosphere of Mars, that is, an amateur.  If someone wants to follow Mars research in depth, it makes sense to subscribe. <br><br>  EarthSky ( <a href="https://twitter.com/earthskyscience">earthskyscience</a> ).  Popular news site.  Space.com competitors, there are often reviews of what can be interesting to observe in space.  For example, posts on individual stars, where to find them, how to observe.  Make announcements of eclipses - lunar, solar, meteor showers - also for fans. <br><br>  Wired Space Photo ( <a href="https://twitter.com/wiredspacephoto">wiredspacephoto</a> ).  Beautiful pictures.  Rarely, but interesting, it also makes sense to subscribe. <br><br>  Planetary Society ( <a href="https://twitter.com/exploreplanets">exploreplanets</a> ).  Very cool guys.  With a powerful PR agency at NASA, they do the same job, but about something else.  This is how many Green Cats NASA cooperates with, and they are popularly talking about space.  A society created by a group of scientists, including Karl Sagan.  There is an editor, journalists, they keep blogs where they write themselves scientists, and even the head of the scientific group of the rover Curiosity.  They also make unique gifs in the same way, take out, dig up some unpublished pictures from the archive from Voyager.  There is enough original content and a lot of such information that can not be found almost anywhere else. <br><br>  ESA ( <a href="https://twitter.com/esa">esa</a> ).  European Space Agency, it makes sense to subscribe. <br><br>  Lockheed Martin ( <a href="https://twitter.com/LockheedMartin">LockheedMartin</a> ).  A company that performs many orders for NASA.  The last interesting thing they had - they announced that in a year they would make a fusion reactor.  We'll see. <br><br>  Spaceflight Now ( <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceflightNow">SpaceflightNow</a> ).  Information resource, mostly about astronautics, about launches.  When something falls, everyone runs to Space Flight Now, because they have the most current, most detailed information.  They can even write about any Russian launch and Russian explosion more than they write Russian sources. <br><br>  NASA Commercial Crew ( <a href="https://twitter.com/Commercial_Crew">Commercial_Crew</a> ).  The NASA division, which deals with private launches.  It is recommended for those who are interested in the development of American private space exploration in collaboration with NASA, launches to the International Space Station, and the like. <br><br>  Orbital Sciences ( <a href="https://twitter.com/OrbitalSciences">OrbitalSciences</a> ).  Became very popular after they had a rocket exploded at the start.  It is not clear now where they will order the next engine, whether it will be Russian again or not, whether they will find it anywhere else or not.  In general, this is more space policy and space business. <br><br>  Arianespace ( <a href="https://twitter.com/Arianespace">Arianespace</a> ).  Practically all space projects for Europeans are being made, and they are launching, including the Russian Unions from the Kourou cosmodrome.  But for the most part it will be useful to those who are interested in the development of European astronautics. <br><br>  NASA Goddard Images ( <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAGoddardPix">NASAGoddardPix</a> ).  One of the divisions, which is engaged in planetology, monitors the research of the Sun. <br><br>  Asteroid Watch ( <a href="https://twitter.com/AsteroidWatch">AsteroidWatch</a> ).  The project is similar to Minor Planet Center. <br><br>  Elon Musk ( <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk">elonmusk</a> ).  Everything is clear without explanation. <br><br>  SpaceX ( <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX">SpaceX</a> ).  Also clear.  And they are great: that Elon Musk, that SpaceX does not always duplicate each other's news.  Some plum about SpaceX can Mask publish at home, and SpaceX can tell something in more detail. <br><br>  Neil deGrasse Tyson ( <a href="https://twitter.com/neiltyson">neiltyson</a> ).  Sometimes publishes interesting things. <br><br>  SarcasticRover ( <a href="https://twitter.com/SarcasticRover">SarcasticRover</a> ).  This is for those who understand the jokes in English related to Mars and space. <br><br>  Universe Today ( <a href="https://twitter.com/universetoday">universetoday</a> ).  Probably the most interesting, for some reason I like most of all this news space site, competitor Space.com and EarthSky. <br><br>  Emily Lakdawalla ( <a href="https://twitter.com/elakdawalla">elakdawalla</a> ).  Editor of Planetary.org, Planetary Society, which replace the press service of NASA.  It is interesting to follow the way she communicates with other scientists.  If you are aware of who she pesters with questions and what is answered to her, then it is interesting. <br><br>  USGS ( <a href="https://twitter.com/USGS">USGS</a> ).  The American geological division, not even affiliated with NASA, but their geologists are working on the Mars exploration program, sometimes they have something interesting that jumps. <br><br>  Scott Maxwell ( <a href="https://twitter.com/marsroverdriver">marsroverdriver</a> ).  The former driver of the rover, became famous for having left to work as a programmer at Google. <br><br>  Bobak Ferdowsi ( <a href="https://twitter.com/tweetsoutloud">tweetsoutloud</a> ).  The other driver of the rover, only Curiosity (Maxwell managed Opportunity), became famous for his Mohawk landing.  He leads the team that drives the rovers.  Can publish news that did not come out officially, information about Curiosity. <br><br>  NASAInSight ( <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAInSight">NASAInSight</a> ).  Soon there will be an interesting mission when it reaches, and it will happen in 2016.  So far, nothing interesting. <br><br>  CassiniSaturn ( <a href="https://twitter.com/CassiniSaturn">CassiniSaturn</a> ).  A blog about the exploration of Saturn, but not enough news, mostly beautiful pictures from the past. <br><br>  NASA Juno Mission ( <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJuno">NASAJuno</a> ).  It will also be interesting when the device reaches Jupiter. <br><br>  Curiosity Rover ( <a href="https://twitter.com/MarsCuriosity">MarsCuriosity</a> ).  No need to explain. <br><br>  Zelenyikot from Mars ( <a href="https://twitter.com/Zelenyikoteyka">Zelenyikoteyka</a> ).  Spread interesting photos from Mars from the Curiosity rover, repost links to their blog posts, and sometimes post hot news like organic matter found on Mars or a repaired Electro-L satellite. <br><br>  On this and finish.  What space twitter are you subscribed to? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364681/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364681/</a></p>
