Today's move by this company, apparently, is the last one on the way to losing customers; with this attitude, many will want to reduce their relationship with the company. <br>  From the category "My dear zhzheshechka" :) <br><br>  Today, a difficult time everyone knows and understands that effective managers in front of their subordinates put in the head of everything the receipt of a profit plan.  So today I am faced with an unpleasant move by this company. <br><br>  Also, I do not like very much any kind of imposing goods or services.  By the type of buying it, you should buy even this and that.  etc.  but the most disgusting thing is when they give it up in their hands not to understand what, and they say, they say you owe us this and that.  This will be discussed further.

      An SMS arrived with the text ‚ÄúHello service is connected to you‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I go to Google and find a description of the service and prices, so it is also paid! <br><br>  After a couple of minutes, the familiar calls with the words that che plays me instead of beeps? <br><br>  It was here that I wanted to throw out a SIM card, which I bought it about 5 years ago all the time ... <br><br>  Further, the epic with the return of the usual dial tone and disconnection from the service, at 0770, they just say that the service is ‚Äúalready connected‚Äù :) <br>  Tomorrow I'll go to the office to talk :) <br>  I‚Äôm tired of when an advertisement comes in a request for balance, I don‚Äôt like when something is ‚Äúconnected‚Äù to me without my consent :( <br>  It may somehow be possible to make a collective complaint or the like.  to the company's management. <br><br>  Further a couple of original steps from our OPPs <br>  <b>UPD1</b> <br><br>  One of the regional operators made a paid check of the balance of ~ 0.05 rubles. <br>  <a href="http://yarsk.ru/news/%3Fi%3D100042525">pufflink</a> <br><br>  Another large operator after a period of 3 months of not <s>using a sim</s> card transfers you to a fat tariff with an ab fee <s>of 600 rubles per day.</s>  <s>and connects you to the service "credit".</s>  <s>10-20 days after the loan is over, you get a subpoena.</s> <br><br>  <i>If MTS subscribers in the Moscow region do not use communication services, both paid and free (for example, receiving incoming calls, USSD requests), for 150 days, then the services will be charged in accordance with the terms of the ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù tariff plan (subscriber The fee for the ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù tariff is about 333 rubles per day).</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>This initiative is aimed at encouraging subscribers who may lose their number in the near future, keep the number behind them and remain an MTS subscriber.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I would like to especially draw your attention to the fact that subscribers do not accumulate debts.</i>  <i>The subscription fee is deducted only from subscribers who are ‚Äúsilent‚Äù and do not receive calls for 150 days, and only with a positive balance, the subscriber does not go to minus.</i>  <i>Therefore, to fear the accumulation of debt in the form of subscription fees is not worth it.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <b>UPD2</b> Apparently you can not further discuss this. <br><br>  <i>The MTS company decided to refuse to collect 10 thousand rubles from the ‚Äúsilent subscribers‚Äù.</i>  <i>monthly fee after a scandal by bloggers.</i>  <i>Recall, to encourage silent subscribers from Moscow and the Moscow region to communicate, the cellular operator decided to "ruble" by introducing exorbitant fines.</i>  <i>The unpopular measure caused a real commotion among customers - it reached the point that regional branches of MTS had to reassure the public.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The fact that exorbitant fines will not be imposed, on Friday, said MTS President Mikhail Shamolin.</i>  <i>According to Vedomosti, not only journalists, but also bloggers were invited to his press conference - Shamolin explained the company's decision to "the subscribers did not understand such a mechanism."</i>  <i>On the eve of the MTS notified subscribers in Moscow and Moscow region on the introduction of new rules from December 14.</i>  <i>If within five months the client does not use communication services and does not replenish the account, then it is automatically transferred to the ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù tariff plan with a subscription fee of 330 rubles.</i>  <i>per day, or 10,000 rubles.</i>  <i>per month.</i>  <i>Many users were afraid that MTS could owe significant sums, and this topic was actively discussed in blogs.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Instead, from December 15, MTS will transfer silent subscribers to the Basic tariff with a subscription fee of 3.35 rubles.</i>  <i>per day, or 100 rubles.</i>  <i>per month.</i>  <i>The funds are written off before the subscriber‚Äôs account reaches a zero balance, therefore the debt for services does not arise, MTS representatives say.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83742/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83742/</a></p>
