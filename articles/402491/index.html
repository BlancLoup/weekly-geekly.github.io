  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Programming the human nervous system. Reciprocal reflex reflex</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The main muscle, which is pumped in fitness clubs and gyms, is the rectus abdominis muscle (the so-called ‚Äúcubes‚Äù, or ‚Äúchocolate bar‚Äù).  And no matter how much swing this muscle, it is still flabby in most people.  Why it happens? <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8b/5dc/692/b8b5dc692c094e4f89061428023e7034.jpg"></div><br>  There are reflexes of inhibition of antagonist muscles.  I will show with the example of the arm: if you bend the arm at the elbow, the biceps work, the opposite antagonist triceps must relax, otherwise you will not bend the arm. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the spinal cord, everything happens unequivocally - if you activate the stretch reflex (read the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/286746/">article on Hicktimes</a> about it) - the impulse is transmitted to the intercalary inhibitory neurons, they inhibit the alpha motoneurons that control the antagonist muscle fibers, and the antagonist relaxes, allowing the muscle to agonist to contract under the action of the stretch reflex. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a8/024/b23/3a8024b23168465a8bb70d64f286dca4.jpg" width="300"></div><br>  At the same time, higher motion control centers and higher muscle tone regulation centers operate in a similar mode, only the antagonist muscle relaxation relaxation with contraction of the agonist is not always performed. <br><br>  When overstressed, the lower back muscles relax the abdominal muscles.  In our society, most people are slightly stooped, and one of the compensatory patterns is to bend over in the lower back to see something in front of you and not look at the floor.  Add joy and high heels for women.  The high heel unfolds the pelvis, naturally, there is a deflection in the lower back, tension in the lower back muscles. <br><br>  How long do you think you can pump a press a day?  Probably ten to twenty minutes.  Even if you are a fan of fitness, then more than an hour is unlikely you will be zealous.  Now calculate how much time your lower back muscles are strained with your usual stooped posture - usually all day and often at night also do not relax to normal.

      Reflexes of antagonist muscle inhibition at tension of the lower back muscles will constantly lead to "flabbiness" of the abdominal muscles.  As soon as the tone of the lower back muscles is normalized, the tone of the abdominal muscles is normalized. <br><br>  Thus, it is possible to tighten the abdominal muscles, without resorting to rocking the press.  In fact, active people who walk a lot, without any problems, climb and descend the stairs, bend over, rise, and the abdominal muscles are strong enough.  Such people, with normal muscle tone of the back, will not have the problem of "flabby stomach". <br><br>  Not all readers of Hiktaimes need details in the form of a lesson to relieve tension from the lower back - for them the next section, where in 5 seconds you can prepare yourself for a photo on the beach, because you should spend some time for your connoisseurs with their spoilers. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to relieve tension from the lower back muscles?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Both lessons will take about an hour.  Lessons are done lying on the floor.  Below are links to audio lessons. <br><br>  <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ag1bdTHZ9O7JibtB2KHLifKkg_VWNw">Lesson on stress relief on the front surface of the body (reduces slouch)</a> <br>  <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ag1bdTHZ9O7Jkr0SboFyyiusoonSLQ">Lesson on stress relief in the lower back muscles</a> <br><br>  <b>Lesson Rules</b> <br>  Each situation from the lesson should be worked out, following the rules for the implementation of somatic lessons: <br>  1. All movements are performed in the comfort zone - if you feel pain or you have to strain hard to make a movement, then reduce the amplitude, make the movement more smoothly and slowly, you can even work out the movement mentally.  Remember that it‚Äôs not the muscles and bones that learn - the brain learns.  Comfort is the main requirement for quality learning. <br>  2. The movements are performed at a slow and smooth pace - the slower and more smoothly the movements are performed, the higher the quality of your training. <br>  3. Do the movements of the lesson in the ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù mode, keep your attention focused on your sensations as you complete the situations from the lesson.  If you think about what happened or what will happen, chase them away. <br>  4. Look for the difference in the ease of performing the movements and in the sensations before and after working through the situation - the more differences you notice, the greater will be the effect of the lesson. <br>  5. Make mistakes.  The more you make and notice mistakes in the implementation of the lesson, the easier it will be for you to find precisely those opportunities for movement that will be the most correct, easy, and joyful for you. <br>  6. After completing the lesson do not rush to give the load in full force, trying a new quality of movement - you can activate old habits.  Try to move slowly, savoring every gesture - many lessons allow you to get a significant effect in completely unexpected situations.  For example, after performing the lessons of dynamic sitting on a chair, you will be able to note that walking has become qualitatively different and the posture has changed while standing. <br></div></div><br><br>  <b>Why does the ‚Äústupid swing of the press‚Äù work in some cases?</b> <br><br>  Remember that reciprocal relationships in higher centers are not always fulfilled?  Depending on the motor task, some of the higher patterns of movement can reduce both an agonist and an antagonist at the same time - when performing, say, an exact movement with a knife, when you need to cut it only to a certain place and stop;  or pushing the car when you need not to fall, if it starts and goes faster than your step. <br><br>  It is possible to activate a similar reaction during the "swing press" - then the result will be noticeable in the form of tension and the rectus abdominis muscle, and the lower back muscles.  There is a stiffness of the movements of the pelvis, increasing the load on the lumbar spine.  The external effect requires too much cost - the excess load leads to increased spinal wear and radiculitis at a young age. <br><br>  And at the same time, if you have subcutaneous fat in the abdomen, contraction of the rectus abdominis muscle will lead to the sternum approaching the pubis.  Due to this, skin tension will decrease and subcutaneous fat will drop even more. <br><br>  <b>Tightening belly for a photo on the beach in 5 seconds</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2be/066/4e1/2be0664e19d34a99b611a5396ece7dea.jpg" height="250"></div><br>  Just raise your hands up and look at your belly.  Now you understand why on the covers of glossy magazines golopuzy models often hold their hands behind their heads.  The same effect can be achieved with lowered hands, if we are able to repeat this internal organization in a new body position. <br><br>  <b>March 25th seminar in Moscow ‚ÄúProgramming the human nervous system‚Äù</b> <br><br>  What will happen at the seminar: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Current knowledge of the neurophysiology of human learning, supported by the practice of using this knowledge.
