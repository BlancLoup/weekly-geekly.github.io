The process of implementing the Unified State Automated Information System in 2005 was fraught with traditional Russian breakup and therefore proceeded quite merrily.  I have an attitude towards imports, so I will not talk about manufacturers - they have their own history.

      <b>The story of three parts</b> <br>  1. As it was before EGAIS. <br>  2. Implementation of the Unified State Automated Information System. <br>  3. What will happen after the USIS <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>1. As it was before EGAIS.</b> </h4><br>  The importer ordered finished excise stamps from the local customs authority and sent it to the factory for labeling on the bottles, since  each bottle had to cross the border with Russia with an existing brand.  At the factory, these stamps were pasted (and many factories at their own expense purchased equipment for the auto-static sticker of stamps specifically for Russia) and sent to us.  The stamps were of several types, depending on the degree and type of product.  For many years, manufacturers are accustomed to and the process was reasonably logical and perfectly debugged. <br><br><h5>  <b>2. Implementation of the Unified State Automated Information System.</b> </h5><br>  Rumors about the alleged ugliness went for a long time and now, in the spring of 2006, the first test implementations began.  I made sure beforehand that our company was included in the test group, so in St. Petersburg we were one of the very first companies that had this miracle.  Perhaps even the first. <br><br>  To begin with, I want to give some characteristics of the technical means in which the means of fixing and transferring information about the volume of production and turnover of ethyl alcohol, alcohol and alcohol-containing products into a single state automated information system for recording the volume of production and circulation of ethyl alcohol, alcohol and alcohol-containing products.  Yes, yes, it is muddy said :) In general, I translate from state-bureaucratic to Russian - the characteristics of computers, which are installed EGAIS: <br><br>  <b>Server:</b> <br>  processor - 2 Intel Xeon processors, at least 2800 Mhz <br>  memory - 4 GB <br>  SCSI RAID <br>  HDD count: at least 5 HDD SCSI 80GB <br>  Streamer type: external HP-5687B <br>  Modem (which is interesting, be sure to Zyxel or Courier) <br><br>  <b>Two ordinary computers</b> - necessarily Intel Pentium 4 with a frequency of not lower than 3000 MHz and 1 gigabyte of memory. <br>  <b>Printer sh / c Datamax I-4208</b> <br>  <b>Scanner of reading of a bar code PDF-417 HD</b> (high density) like Welch Allen IT3800 <br><br>  <b>Soft:</b> <br>  For Windows Server 2003 Server Std, MS SQL Server 2000 Standart Editions SP4, ViPNet (Personal Firewall). <br>  For jobs XP. <br><br>  At first, it was somewhat incomprehensible why such capacities are for the usual server-client applications, even in MS SQL.  But then, in the process of testing, the situation began to clear up - this buggy, written by students on the Delphi, simply shamelessly slowed down on weaker machines.  As it turned out even later, in the course of work, not only the server part of the program was inhibited, but also the not very well-designed sql-base.  However, more on that later. <br><br>  The developers of this complex were Federal State Unitary Enterprise ‚ÄúScientific and Technical Center‚Äú Atlas ‚Äùof the FSB of Russia, but the guys from Crystal-Service installed and set up the whole thing.  By the way, they are really well versed in the product and caught a lot of glitches. <br><br>  And finally, the complex is installed, everything is more or less configured, you can work.  But, as they say, there are nuances :) I will describe the process. <br><br>  1. There is some data - <br>  1.1.  Manufacturer Name <br>  1.2.  Product name and its characteristics <br>  1.3.  Certificate for this product. <br>  The whole thing needs to be entered into the Unified State Automated Information System and the tax in Moscow must assign unique codes. <br>  2. After assignment of codes, an application for bar-coding to customs is created. <br>  3. We receive confirmation of the application and finally print the stamps. <br><br>  Further, the process is almost indistinguishable from pre-EGAIS times. <br><br>  Now about the nuances. <br>  Paragraph 1 must be performed sequentially - first a request for assigning a code to the manufacturer, then a code for the name, and after binding the certificate.  And everything would be fine, but the Federal Service Management Center (command and control center), where codes are assigned, is one for the whole country.  And codes are assigned almost manually.  No, it is generated automatically, of course, but the operator needs to press the confirmation button each time.  Imagine how much time you had to wait? <br>  But that is not all.  Muscovites immediately sent their requests to the Federal TsUK, and the regions first went through the local TsUKi, where operators also have to click on the transfer button. <br>  If you think that the problems of the 1st item end there, this is far from being so :) It is understood that the system can exchange some information between end users - one, for example, is located in St. Petersburg, the other in Vladvostok.  What does this mean?  Routing mail.  And the curve.  Messages sometimes reach, sometimes get lost in whole packs, and sometimes go to the completely left TsUK and settle there.  Nothing like?  And I was visited by the thought that the EGAIS complex was developed by FIDOshniki, at least in terms of routing :) This is no offense to FIDOshniki (the former fidoshnik himself, even the hub), just very much reminded :) <br>  It was very amusing to search for your messages in all TsUKs of the country, especially when containers with goods are placed somewhere in the transit port (brands can be glued on the bottles not only at the manufacturing plant, but also on the way to Russia) and a considerable amount of money drips every day. . <br>  In the beginning, there was another interesting problem - if the naming code arrives, the certificate can easily disappear somewhere.  In this case, you had to use your hands to climb into the database, create a certificate and tie it to the product. <br><br>  Initially it was assumed that the administrators of the importing company would not have access to the server and database, but taking into account the inclusion in the group, so to speak, beta testers, the presence of permanent failures, as well as good relations with the Crystallists, I had full control over the server and well studied the structure of the base and the principles of the whole complex, which had a positive impact on further work.  Subsequently, I even wrote a small program (exclusively for internal use), which performed the necessary actions in the database. <br><br>  And finally, we are ready for point 2 and 3. There were almost no problems with routing, because we were connected to customs, also in the best traditions of FIDO - by modem.  And ‚Äúalmost‚Äù is because applications could also disappear at any stage of passage through customs.  I would even say that they could not have disappeared, but that they disappeared.  How the application can disappear on a direct path from point A to point B did not even know the Crystalloins.  But the developers probably knew (although they were silent as partisans), because  In one of the updates of the complex, the problem was fixed.  Updates, by the way, are a separate song - they were afraid of it terribly, because with every update something must have broken.  That stopped the application to leave, then just nothing started, then something else.  Then, however, accustomed. <br><br>  Well, the confirmation of the application for bar-coding is received, you can print stamps.  Strangely it happened, but the fact is that stamp printing was assigned to the IT department.  On the one hand, it‚Äôs logical and logical - the problems with the system are permanent, they need to be resolved promptly, but on the other ... The brands are smelly, the noise from thermal transfer printers is awesome, and it takes quite a lot of time from the main work - in general, it was a good reason to expand the department and significantly increase the level of wages in the department :) <br><br>  What are brands?  This is such a reel of blanks, with a volume of 5000 pieces, made on the State Sign.  Blank stamps are pasted on a strip of paper and rolled up.  The printer is smart, prints the stacker, determines the brand boundary, scrolls to the next, prints the next barcode, etc.  until the end of the reel.  Each brand already has a unique number, this number is in the application for bar-coding. <br>  And everything would be fine, but - GosZnak also likes to mow (interesting, and how do they print money?).  For example, there is no free space between brands, brands without a number, absence of a brand, incorrectly glued brands, mixed numbers, rough gluing in the middle of a reel, and other jambs.  What this leads to is that the printer prints absolutely not on the stamps on which it wanted and the numbering gets lost in the database.  Or simply chew on this reel and spoils the brand.  And everything would be fine if it were possible to take and correct the numeration.  But no, there is a protection in the system - after all, if the downed numbering could be corrected, then in the same way the left marks could also be printed.  Therefore, a mechanism for returning damaged stamps was provided. <br>  As always, the nuance - this mechanism did not work :) Much later, we found out that the mechanism worked, even described in detail in the documentation how to use it, but by that time they got used to it in a simple way - handles in the database :) Honestly, I just can‚Äôt imagine we did, if there was no direct access to the database. <br><br><h5>  <b>3. What will happen after the USIS</b> </h5><br>  Finally, the work is debugged, almost nothing is buggy, the epic is over.  There was a lot of things - there was work for 16 hours a day, there were overnight stays at work, nerves were at the limit ... Maybe everything would have been transferred much easier if it had not been crawling into the front row with a beta tester ... <br><br>  And why did I decide to write about it?  Because less than three years after the painful introduction of the Unified State Automated Information System from the Atlas, a new system appeared in the time, the Unified State Automated Information System from GNIVTS.  Now I‚Äôm finishing the implementation of this system.  Pain, as they say :) <br><br>  PS Invite, in fact, received, thank you. <br>  PPS Unified State Automated Information System from GNIVTSa also introduced, if it will be interesting, I will tell you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65437/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65437/</a></p>
