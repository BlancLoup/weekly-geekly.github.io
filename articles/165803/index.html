Telephone</b> <br>  Agree that when, in 1876, the United States issued a patent to Alexander Bell, no one could think that a modern device like an iPhone would still be called a Phone.  Just agree that the main mission of the phone - to transmit sound over long distances in the same iPhone occupies far from the first and not the second position.  I think that the release of Ubuntu Phone, which is expected in February, is not expected to transfer sound to an even more distant plan. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>2. OS</b> <b><br></b>  I caught myself thinking that recently there has been a sharp jump in the number of variously different operating systems, and the regular update of existing ones has clearly become fashionable.  Do you remember that the difference between Windows 1.0 and Windows 2.0 is two years.  Just think, Billy and company have been sitting and polishing the update for their OS for two years!  Try now to write a stunningly popular game, let's say on Android, let's say Angry Birds, release the first release and sit down for a sequel.  After a couple of years - voila!  You put your continuation on public, thinking that it will be just as popular by analogy with the first creation.  But no - it doesn‚Äôt need anyone.  Consciousness of users is hammered by other projects that are constantly updated, release add-ons, forget concepts on tables in cafes, and whose evil Chinese hackers have a twig source code, that is, they are trying with all their might to excite someone else's consciousness.  I do not call to reflect on the times that have sunk into oblivion.  Just for a second realize that the Android phone is on the table, you are reading this post from the tablet on Windows 8, your friend is involved in the development of Crome OS, you are looking forward to the release of Ubuntu Phone, and your wife asked for help to update her iOS .

      <b>3. Hardware</b> <b><br></b>  In other words, iron.  In my subjective opinion, this is the area that is currently stalled in place.  We will not go into the technical details, the fact is that five years ago, what was inside the system unit at home in the computer is now in the phone.  Yes, for ordinary computers, Intel and Nvidia continue to release something there, but in reality, this does not give a huge increase in speed and performance.  Personally, I remember very well, the feeling of replacing a pebble of Pentium 2 with a Pentium 3 <br><br>  <b>4. Applications</b> <br>  I propose to reflect on what we see on the screens of their devices.  Are there people among the readers who know what MS DOS is?  So I forgot.  What MS is understandable is a hedgehog, and DOS it turns out to be a Disk Operating System.  Today, DOS is exotic, what we see today is not at all like it, although the pros understand that this is like a Swiss watch - throw out at least one gear from the case and the clock will stop working.  GUI is that instead of DOS.  But still, the user interface instead of the operating system, it is strongly said.  And yet‚Ä¶ <br><br>  <b>5. Internet</b> <br>  Stuck forward with leaps and bounds.  The reason for this, it seems to me, are two things flowing and feeding one another.  The first is Social Networks, and the second is Consumer Society.  Virtually any product, in addition to advertising on the websites of the manufacturer, distributor, seller has its mark in social networks.  I would also suggest replacing the term ‚ÄúSocial Network‚Äù with ‚ÄúVirtual Social Network‚Äù, because as an ordinary social network, we all live with you, our parents even started registering there.  The main engine of the Internet is advertising, and advertising is the engine of trade, and demand creates supply and, as a result, trade.  As a result, we do not even have a circle, but a spiral-whirlpool, which all spins up and unwinds, simultaneously drawing in itself, dating sites, subject forums, torrent trackers, online stores and blogs, in a word, everything that we call the Internet. <br><br>  <b>6. WEB browser</b> <br>  Agree, the true king of the Internet.  Without it, nowhere at all, yes, Skype, ICQ email clients, clients of social networks and cloud services are perfectly fine without it, and everything else?  Remember, once upon a time, in Win ME, immediately after a successful installation and first launch, a phrase appeared on the Start button: ‚ÄúStart your work by pressing this button‚Äù; today such notification should be hung over a pre-installed browser (at least for the first Download the one you used to).  Currently, Google Crome OS is essentially a browser, not an OS, since for any reason it‚Äôs not accessing the RAM and the processor, but to the cloud.  Today, the browser is a god, a king and a porridge with oil on a modern PC, Tablet, Phone.  Especially on PCs, developers are trying to teach the Internet browser everything they can, from downloading torrents to collecting mail, only so that the user can open their brainchild and never close it. <br><br>  <b>7. GOOOOOOOGLE</b> <br>  All have long understood that Google is not just a search engine, it is a whole socio-cultural phenomenon that affects everyone.  I would not be surprised if the USA will soon declare war on Google and lose it the next day, since a clip will appear in youtube in which the White House and the Pentagon explode.  The soldiers simply will not go to war with anyone since they will be sure that their superiors are all dead.  All this would be funny if it were not so sad.  The scope that Google now possesses gives him, as a corporation as a whole, practically unlimited possibilities, how he will manage them depends on specific people. <br><br>  As you have already noticed, the devil has turned out to be some kind of philosophical one.  In any case, I was aiming at pushing thoughts.  Not on concrete thoughts but on the thought process itself, sincerely hope that I succeeded. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165803/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165803/</a></p>
