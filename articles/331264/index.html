  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Analytical tools: a review of lucrative offers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The harsh reality is that with all the variety of solutions for search engine optimization, analytics of mobile applications and tracking of user actions, teams are often forced to make their choice on the principle of ‚Äúwhich is cheaper‚Äù.  But even with this approach, you can get a good toolkit, if you're lucky enough to catch the moment.  Today we present to the readers a small selection of analytical services that currently offer their services for free or on preferential terms.  The list includes both very young projects and large, well-known players in the market.  Do not miss the chance! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c28/f69/8a6/c28f698a6b794b509ad4e7ed315df1c2.jpeg"><br><br>  <b><a href="https://ru.megaindex.com/">Megaindex</a></b>

      About Megaindex know, perhaps, all who had to deal with the promotion of the site.  In normal circumstances, this service can be considered a gift for the masses - it offers such a rich set of tools for SEO optimization and web analytics for free.  However, a number of interesting tools for comparative analysis with competitors, working with search queries (tops on queries, clustering), tracking external and outgoing links, downloading incoming links to any site, assessing the visibility and quoting of sites, still remain outside the scope of free access.  At the moment, project leaders are offering habrovans a tempting opportunity to try out an extended service package at no additional charge and on completely legal grounds.  To automatically connect to the Lite tariff for the next month, simply follow the <a href="https://goo.gl/ruQQoy">magic link</a> , register and enjoy access to the full set of applications from the company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://userx.pro/ru/"><b>Userx</b></a> <br><br>  Userx is a young project whose goal is to provide detailed data on user behavior for mobile applications.  Video analytics tools allow you to record sessions and capture gestures for later viewing and analysis.  Watching the sequence of actions of real users, the developer can get detailed information about typical patterns of interaction with the interface and problems in usability.  In the future, it is planned to introduce features such as a thermal touch map and a user behavior map and intelligent filters.  At the moment, the company offers early followers free access to the full functionality of the service.  The number of places is naturally limited, and there are few free slots. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fce/a5a/e14/fcea5ae148fd4d5ab33560f178cdf91c.png"></div><br><br>  <b><a href="https://attriboost.com/">Attriboost</a></b> <br><br>  Another project with the heat of the heat, a branch of Fiksu - a tool for analytics of mobile advertising.  The developers adapted part of the functionality for the needs of a wider audience and launched a service tracker that allows you to track user behavior within the application.  The list of opportunities includes: monitoring of metrics for basic types of events, audience analysis for effective targeting, cohort analysis, campaign and integration management.  In the future, the product will be transferred to the premium model, but is currently distributed free of charge.  According to the project manager, the solution will be especially useful for those who have not used tracking to promote the application, small teams with a limited budget, as well as those who are trying to optimize the cost of analytics. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://ux.hubspot.com/beta/web-analytics-dashboard">Hubspot</a></b> <br><br>  Hubspot is a very feature rich platform, very widely known and very expensive.  The services offered by the company are divided into three areas - CRM, marketing and sales, and the tools for web analytics are mostly concentrated in the ‚ÄúMarketing‚Äù segment.  For free, you can access only the most basic information on traffic and conversion;  all other, more interesting functions (segmentation, reports, A / B testing, detailed site analysis, work with advertising campaigns, review of competitors) are provided only for a monthly fee of $ 200.  It does not sound very encouraging, but there is one loophole: the Hubspot team is constantly recruiting beta testers from among its own clients to work with new functions, including analytical solutions.  To apply, just fill out a form on the site.  Restrictions related to what package of services - paid or free - uses the applicant, not stated. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4e0/edd/8b0/4e0edd8b0c2a44d896678a9e2fffc23b.png"></div><br>  <b><a href="https://piwik.org/">Piwik</a></b> <br><br>  Piwik offers an open-source solution for those who can host it on their own server.  The service includes a fairly wide range of functions: web analytics (standard KPI - visits, downloads, conversion, key positions, information about visitors, devices and sessions), statistics on ecommerce indicators (sales, conversion, average revenue per visit, percentage of abandoned baskets , similar logs for each purchase), tracking marketing campaigns, analytics for the intranet.  To make it easier to understand the data arrays, multiple widgets can be connected, grouped, and distributed to dashboards in accordance with personal goals and needs.  The actions of users can be observed both in real time and backdating, tracking the dynamics and trends - as the infrastructure belongs to the client, the history is preserved without restrictions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331264/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331264/</a></p>
