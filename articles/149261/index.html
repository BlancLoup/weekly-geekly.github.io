  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MTS again (this time the Internet)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In general, an adventure happened to me here.  In the near future I plan to move and decided to connect myself to the Internet at a new place.  As it turned out with the Internet in the center of Moscow in general trouble.  And, in general, the Internet from MTS (as I understand the former Stream) * remained almost the only alternative. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I went to their site and filled out an application, having difficulty making an error after 500 and acting like ‚Äúupdate‚Äù ‚Äúsend data again‚Äù.  It was possible to fill out the form and a letter with the application number fell in the mail.  I also indicated in the form what time to send the master to me (I would have managed without it, but I need a Wi-Fi router, and they probably have an agreement), the date was 5-6 days after filling in the application .  There it was stated that the master would contact me before coming. <br><br>  The day when the master was to come, came, but there were no calls.  It alarmed me that I decided to contact their support.  After going through the multi-menu, I went to the girl who checked the data, specified the phone number and asked to call back if no one would contact me within half an hour.  Needless to say that for two hours no one called.  I had to call the second time, I got to another support employee.  He asked a lot of things, such as if I had applied for them, and not at MGTS.  But in the end, after checking the data and asking if I should wait for the master, he gave an affirmative answer, yes of course, today you have from 20 to 22.  I even specifically asked if he was sure?  He was sure. <br><br>  Needless to say that from 20 to 22 no one came.  And finally, in the morning I still get an INCOMING call from MTS employees who tell me that they have run out of equipment and when it is not known.  They offer to either wait or, as an option, connect via MGTS (I know that, in fact, this is one office, with similar tariffs).  And the girl even offered to transfer my application there, to which I said thank you and said that I will contact them.  Yes, as it turned out, that was my mistake.

      I pre-check rates and conditions and draw up an application at MGTS (by the way, this is much easier for them than on the MTS website, which offer to fill out a 5-step form).  After half an hour, their employee calls me back and says that my line is blocked by the MTS and that they can connect me, it is necessary to unlock the MTS.  In general, they say, call them. <br><br>  I call again in the MTS, describing the situation.  I am asked to write an application for removal from the blocking line, attach a copy of the passport and the date of filing of the application and then I can still connect to the Internet via MGTS.  When I was asked to contact me with the girl who called in the morning and offered the ‚Äúeasy option‚Äù, they could not help me. <br><br>  I sincerely hope that such incomprehensible crap when working with clients in their single version. <br><br>  * I <sub>found out that in the house, in addition to MTS, there is also some kind of wire complat provider with tariffs that are not very adequate for Moscow (1,500 rubles for 30 Mbit).</sub> <br><br>  <b>UPD (08.21.2012)</b> : A day after the publication (I remind you that it was on August 8), they contacted me through Habr from the MTS support service and took my case under special control.  After another couple of days, MTS released the line, and they themselves transferred my data to MGTS.  Further, already from MGTS they reported that on August 15 a master would contact me regarding the installation of the equipment.  By August 20, I began to worry about where the master was and began to call in support of MGTS myself.  After the second call on August 21, they promised that in 2 or 3 days the master would call me.  I continue to monitor the situation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149261/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149261/</a></p>
