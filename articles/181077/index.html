I try the third time.  In order to avoid a misfire, I explain the idea ‚Äî a cherished one that the decade has been fostering ‚Äî from a different angle and literally on the fingers, there is no place to be easier. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Accounting social network has nothing to do with official accounting.  This is not just another project to automate existing accounting, but an attempt to distribute advanced accounting technologies in a non-standard way. <br><br>  What is this technology?

      Provide a small universal agent accounting program.  What it should be, I know.  The technical task was carried out on the basis of <b>accountology</b> - a scientific discipline developed by me in an attempt to comprehend the technology of ideal accounting.  However, now it is not about her, but about the possible application of its accounting principles in practice. <br><br>  So, there is a universal program-agent intended for maintaining informal accounting.  The arrival of objects, the consumption of objects, in the end the balance of the objects.  Of course, objects can be characterized by some properties that are used in the preparation of reports. <br><br>  It is important that the properties of objects: <br><br><ul><li>  first, set by the users themselves; </li><li>  secondly, their number is limited.  In the specification, 40 properties fields are assumed, although this number can be any, in principle. </li></ul><br>  Each of the users who have downloaded the agent program uses it to the best of their needs: someone takes into account the books in the library, someone - personal property, someone - goods in stock. <br><br>  The peculiarity of agent programs is in the methodology that allows to take into account: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>nesting</b>  Under nesting refers to the presence of the object components.  The program allows you to take into account the union of several objects into one and the division of the object into parts, thereby obtaining a list of parts of the object, parts of its parts, etc.  down to the elementary units.  In passing, I note that other accounting programs do not allow this, as far as I know; </li><li>  <b>transfer of an object</b> from one user to another, including through a trade exchange. </li></ul><br>  On point two I‚Äôll dwell more: this is the core of technology. <br><br>  How is trade exchange taken into account in modern accounting software?  In fact, in a disagreement.  Someone bought, someone sold: the parties exchanged goods and money and registered operations in databases that were not related to each other.  If desired, the data can be consolidated, having received joint financial statements, these possibilities of database interaction are usually exhausted. <br><br>  Universal agent-program allows a fundamentally different thing: to transfer a link to an object from one database to another.  The solution of the problem is facilitated by the fact that the database structure for all users is the same. <br><br>  In accordance with the concept of transferring objects from user to user, the new user - the current owner of the object - has the right to view in a foreign database the parameters of the received object.  If user A sends an object to user B, then user A acquires the right to view in database B all the information relating to this object.  This allows the new owner to: <br><br><ul><li>  learn the history of the received object, to which the owner has an unconditional right, it seems to me; </li><li>  do not re-register the properties of the received object, since they are registered in the database of the previous owner. </li></ul><br>  By transferring objects to each other, individual decentralized agent programs are concatenated into a single accounting space ‚Äî a new type of social network. <br><br>  What are the advantages of the stated approach? <br><br>  Imagine today as unrepresentable: all legal entities and individuals have universal agent programs and keep records in them.  How does the linking of individual databases into a single accounting space occur?  As it is said: by transferring the objects taken into account from the user to the user - trade interaction between the subjects of economy. <br><br>  Mining companies extract minerals and keep them, so to speak, initial accounting.  Fine. <br><br>  Further, mining companies transfer minerals to processing enterprises.  Together with the material objects, processing enterprises, in their databases, are passed links to the registered objects.  Pay attention: there is no need for the processing enterprises to characterize the minerals anew: why, if they have already been characterized in the bases of the mining complex?  Processing enterprises characterize objects - minerals - only to the extent they change them, in other words, as part of their production activities. <br><br>  Some processors transfer objects to others, as well as to the entire technological production chain.  Over this length, the properties of each of the objects change sequentially and are recorded in the same order, and in accordance with their nesting.  After all, production operations consist not only in changing the properties of objects, but also in re-arranging them: in combining (for example, assembling parts into a single mechanism) or in separation (for example, the total volume of mineral resources extracted).  The agent program, thanks to its methodology, keeps track of nesting: as a result, the new owner can determine by whom and from what materials both the object as a whole and any part of it was produced. <br><br>  In the end, the objects fall into the trade, from trade - to the final consumers. <br><br>  What does accounting social network give them - end users?  Same as for the other owners of the objects: complete production information about the product that they have. <br><br>  Now - a picture from the future. <br><br>  You get the goods in the store.  You pay, of course, with a plastic card - not in cash, really ?!  In a plastic card along with other data is embedded information about your account in the social network account.  When you come home, you find an email message, with a notification: a new object has been added to your account database.  If you wish, you can refuse to register it, but you can agree with the registration.  If you take into account all purchased goods, it is obvious that your universal program will include everything you own: personal property.  Of course, from time to time you will have to record the consumption of discarded or irretrievably consumed things. Provided that there is a universal and complete record, a decentralized database will appear, encompassing not only planetary production, but also personal property, in short, everything produced by humanity. <br><br>  An important detail regarding the commercial aspect of the project.  The transfer of objects to each other is carried out between registered users through the processing center - the manufacturer's service.  If the distribution of a universal program agent can be free at first, then the transfer of objects between users - the main attraction of the program agent - should be carried out on a paid basis.  Imagine the financial strength of the corporation that first implements and begins to control the global accounting network. <br><br>  Just do not say that what has been said for a long time is known and suggested: it is not known and in this form it was not proposed, although it suggests itself in connection with the general direction of computerization.  I assure you, a couple of years after implementation, this approach will become commonplace. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181077/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181077/</a></p>
