It was a real coup, with which widespread progress began.  People who had been enriched by borrowing the values ‚Äã‚Äãof other people saw a new path.  They realized that you can make money the other way, by trading.  The significance of this event is difficult to overestimate.  It was a change of centuries-old relations, which gave impetus and hope to everyone around for a wonderful future. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  People saw how things were changing around them, they believed in progress.  Even more than that, they were confident that this will and will continue.  Most of them were confident that the coming years will be a period of unprecedented technological progress.  Many considered themselves to be inventors and invent and even patented.

Then the growth rates slowed down noticeably, people found themselves in a situation where they had to work more and more for the same wage.  This probably affected all industries except IT. <br><br>  Nowadays, all than trade, from the goods, and ending with time and experience. <br><br>  At the same time, economic growth provides an increase in the standard of living, but most people do not receive equal benefits.  Think about this: people can not be equal (to have equal benefits), just because it would lead to an environmental disaster (can not be all on the car, iphone and yacht). <br><br>  Any change in production, whether writing websites or creating nanorobots, can be viewed from two sides.  This is a qualitative change or quantitative. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dac/5b4/1b9/dac5b41b9394aefdfb6458ea5a06cf2e.png"><br><br>  Quality is when technology comes in changes that give results that have never been seen before, for example, a reduction in the price of production or a greater audience reach. <br><br>  Either this is a quantitative increase, which is much simpler.  For example, we used to produce 10 cars now produce 100 - cool, but the quality remains the same or worse. <br><br>  Over the past 10 years - 20 years, we can see how globalization affects our community.  With the advent of transnational corporations, everything is changing.  They do not obey the laws of one country, they are focused on profit, and are ready to change everything around to get it. <br>  This is well illustrated by the example of China, India and other poor countries.  Residents who are used for the production of cheap products and obtain excess corporate profits. <br><br>  We can call such relations the market of globalism, they contribute to the asymmetry - that is, injustice in the trade relations between rich and poor societies.  The unregulated global economy also produces sweating working conditions that benefit transnational companies.  Where it is beneficial for the rich that the poor become even poorer ... <br><br>  In addition, deregulation of the world economy leads to the erosion of the welfare state and its protection.  These are violations of human rights and the establishment of slave relations under the influence of companies on the state.  It also leads to a net outflow of capital from some of the world's poorest societies. <br><br>  Did such relationships affect IT?  Of course! <br><br>  Probably the first precedent can be considered the moment when in the USA they began to resent Microsoft‚Äôs activities under the leadership of Bill Gates, in relation to emigrant employees (Hindus): work without bonuses, tax evasion, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/32c/23a/cde/32c23acde4a655f6d6130046f7ae0545.png"><br><br>  It was necessary to resolve the issue.  And then Bill dismissed all the emigrant employees, and then hired them out of the state through labor exchanges.  Where is the exchange, as if leased employees.  Thus, such employees have lost all benefits: premiums, appropriate salaries, bonuses, etc., familiar to full-time employees. <br><br>  This is a typical outsourcing scheme today. <br><br>  Developed countries produce most of the world's wealth, but lose their labor power, which is currently in the poorest countries.  The population of developing countries is much more difficult to survive because of low per capita incomes. <br><br>  Now we can observe the further development of such relations in IT.  This is freelancing, outsourcing, remote work in some places. <br><br>  The so-called outsourcing companies work according to the scheme of providing a large amount of unskilled and cheap labor, for the lowest possible price.  Now people move from one company to another, without changing their place of residence.  This creates unemployment in developed countries in some specialties (for example, recall GM, nothing came of IT from the head) and economic opportunities in other countries. <br><br>  Medical tourism, for example, is a form of highly skilled outsourcing that exports the work of doctors by attracting patients to low-cost medical institutions outside of their countries.  Or else doctors from poor countries sell their labor to people from rich countries. <br><br>  Outsourcing companies can not grow qualitatively, only grow and grow quantitatively.  Because they themselves do not produce anything, but work for someone.  For survival, they are forced to keep a low price for labor.  So live for example Belarusian outsourcers exploiting student work.  Representing them as seniors, for the "major American customer."  If the price of workers will be the average market customer will not be difficult to assemble your development team on site. <br><br>  Freelance is a form of outsourcing, where the intermediary disappears in the form of any company.  Here a person works 1 on 1 with the customer.  For the customer, such a scheme is beneficial as the employee works out of state, and this is no obligation for bonuses, insurance, taxes, etc.  And from the employee, when the necessary work was done, it is easy to get rid of. <br><br>  For an employee from the poorest countries, this is beneficial, since he can actually receive an equal salary with specialists from developed countries for his work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/00e/37d/8e2/00e37d8e26a1c46852bf76160256777c.png"><br><br>  An intermediate option between outsourcing companies and freelancing in its pure form, can be a studio.  Where the freelancer acts as an intermediary between the customer and the performers.  In the case of outsourcing companies, there can be no qualitative growth, only horizontal - a quantitative increase.  I want to note that this is the case if the studios do not work on the production of their own products for sale. <br><br>  Think about this - the largest and most powerful political and corporate global players are the USA, China, India, Google, Facebook, Honda, Samsung. <br><br>  But small communities / countries / projects can and do surpass them in quality terms. <br><br>  In fact, small countries occupy most of the top positions in polls that assign global ratings for quality of life, environmental performance, and even competitiveness.  Thus, small communities have advantages that may outweigh their disadvantages. <br><br>  This also applies to startups and small cozy companies.  There, people still have an understanding of what is happening around, and who are all these people ... Do not believe the article, ask your friends, acquaintances ... Personally, I experienced everything on personal experience after working on all sides of the barricades. <br><br>  In conclusion, I want to say: <br><br>  Those who spend power on a quantitative increase forget about quality, this applies both to companies and to countries as a whole. <br><br>  But if you are a young specialist, remember: it is better to start a career in large companies, the main professional activity should be carried out in small companies or somewhere on the side.  And you need to finish a career in large companies, you can in your own. <br><br>  P.c.  I wrote under the influence of the <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/UTAustinX/UT.3.01x/2013_Sept/">courses.edx.org/courses/UTAustinX/UT.3.01x/2013_Sept</a> , I advise everyone. <br>  I also advise you to read <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Logo">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Logo</a> , where there are excellent examples of globalization in various fields. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/194790/">https://habr.com/ru/post/194790/</a></p>
