      There are many remarkable methodologies and standards of project management and no less remarkable books that describe in detail the practices of PMBOK, CMMI, SOVNET, RUP.  This book does not purport to be considered a methodological reference.  The authors do not think that it thoroughly covered what has already been described in other sources. <br>  In an effort to develop the approach used in the first book of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/piter/blog/258807/">IT Professional Path</a> series, the authors cite only real practitioners and only good practices tested by them on their own experience in real projects, referring to recommended or basic methodological sources.  All practices are organized in blocks to help you quickly find the right recommendations and immediately start using them. <br>  The functions of the manager are not limited to the mechanical application of standards and methodologies.  The art of a manager is to select from their richest arsenal the ones that best suit the project, its environment and this organization, depending on its level of maturity and staff qualifications.  It is on this book that a serious emphasis is placed. <br>  From this point of view, the mission and purpose of the publication is to give impetus to rethinking existing experience, understanding what knowledge may not be enough to develop the underlying principles in managing software development and turn them into patterns with a clear understanding of the criteria for which pattern it makes sense to apply. <br>  This book - the result of more than 15 years of work of authors in the field of software development and information systems.  Its main advantage is practical orientation.  It analyzes a variety of cases and situations, provides examples of documents and templates required for software development.  In addition, the book structures a huge array of theoretical information, depending on what has been tested in practice and can be used in the work of professionals in the field of software development. <br><br><h5>  Who is this book for? </h5><br>  This book is for professional managers in the project or functional areas of software development, working group leaders, project managers, heads of departments / directors of software development departments. <br>  The book will be useful for both novice managers and managers with experience.  The first will be able to find in it new practices for themselves that are almost ready to be used in real industrial life.  The latter will be able to generalize and systematize knowledge, look critically from different sides on their own experience and the experience of the authors of the book, perhaps, to revise some patterns or decide to use some of the authors in their own practice. <br>  Of particular note is that the book attempts to fill the gap for the heads of departments / functional departments associated with software development.  There is quite a lot of literature describing practices and principles of project management, but similar aspects for functional managers are rather poorly covered.  In this book, this array of information is structured in a group of patterns of management of a software development department. <br>  The uniqueness of this book is that you will find practical information gathered in one place with links to theoretical materials from different areas of software development management: analysis, architecture, project management, leadership and personnel management - what you will need in your work on real production projects. <br><br><h5>  What you will NOT find in this book </h5><br>  In this book you will not find a naked theory.  We will provide only the necessary theoretical minimum to illustrate practices and methods.  The management, analysis and other disciplines of software development that are affected in the book are quite mature subjects today, and it will not be difficult for you to find materials on them in the Internet and textbooks for sale. <br>  We do not aim to give the reader a theoretical education.  The book is focused on the active reader, who has already understood that he must search and absorb the theoretical base independently.  You will not find in the book also the authors' confidence that only the described path of the manager and only the methods and techniques offered by the authors are correct.  On the contrary, several paths lead to the same goal.  We want to show you the path that we ourselves have taken, in which we are sure to give only those patterns that led us to success on this path. <br><br><h5>  About the authors </h5><br>  Andrei Dmitrievich Pererva <br>  41 years old.
