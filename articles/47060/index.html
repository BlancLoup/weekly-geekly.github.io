Such meetings are becoming a regular event, attracting more and more startups and sympathizing with them.  The next seminar, as always, was intense, intense and, as it seems, with the benefit of speakers and ordinary participants.  As in the previous cases, the event was co-organized by the <a href="http://rma.ru/">innovative education company RMA</a> . <br><br>  The format of the meetings remains the same as before - these are two-minute reports on projects (elevator pitch) with their subsequent uncompromising discussion (StartLinch).  However, there were innovations.  A new entity appeared - lincher, the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù opponent of the current start-up; the participants now have a ‚Äúkarma‚Äù that can grow as a result of the activity shown.  In addition, the proposal expressed at the last meetings was implemented - at the end of the meeting startups shared their secrets, whose projects have already stood up and are considered successful. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  At the beginning of the meeting, Vitaly Akimov, project manager for <a href="http://ochenhochu.ru/">OchenHochu.ru</a> , spoke about the format and program of the seminar and introduced the speakers.  Below is a description of the reports and questions asked by the speaker.

      <b><a href="http://flagatrip.ru/">Flagatrip</a></b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur project is designed for travel lovers.  In it, the user can satisfy basic travel-related needs, from planning a trip to sharing impressions, when, for example, he shares his reviews or posts photos.  Thus, your trips can be thought out, taking into account the reviews and feedback from other travelers.  We see the monetization of the project in advertising and additional paid planning services - booking, booking tickets.  We estimate the prospects of our development quite well. ‚Äù <br><br>  Lincher of this project was ‚Äúin the subject line‚Äù - according to him, he himself had developed a similar site for a long time.  On this occasion, he remarked: "We have been conducting our project for quite a long time and successfully, however, more successful competitors appeared on the market, and we leaked all the traffic to them."  In this regard, the first question linter was expected. <br><br>  <b>- Did you study the market before you start?</b> <br>  - Yes, they studied.  We are better due to the fact that initially focused on similar Western platforms.  At the moment, in RuNet, few people satisfy all the needs of a client in this area.  There are no decent sites among Russian services. <br><br>  <b>- What is your difference from the <a href="http://www.venividi.ru/">Venividi.ru</a> project?</b> <br>  - We looked at this project.  A very small part of our audience encourages such a site to share experiences.  Also, there are not enough additional funds for planning trips. <br><br>  <b>- How do you stimulate the exchange of impressions?</b> <br>  - In principle, we are moving towards vanity.  Although people are different.  Those who prefer to travel on their own - spend a lot of time planning.  At the same time, our project is multifaceted - not everyone wants to deal only with planning, some visitors just want to share their impressions, post their photos. <br><br>  <b>- Information about what travel can be found on the site?</b> <br>  - About any.  You can find information about a holiday in the Moscow region or a business trip where Obama managed to take a picture. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.video-english.ru/">VideoEnglish</a></b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn fact, the best exercise for mastering a non-native language is listening.  We have added the possibility of Internet technology to this process.  The essence of the project is a website that provides a database of videos in English.  The user listens to the text and tries to reproduce it in writing.  The intended audience is people of 20 years of age who want to improve their language skills. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>- Do you use videos only from YouTube?</b> <br>  - No, we all store on the server. <br><br>  <b>- Could you clarify your goals for the next six months?</b> <br>  - For now - just run.  Now the project is at the stage of a technical prototype.  The launch is scheduled for February 1 of the coming year.  In principle, I would like to have 4-5 thousand visitors per day. <br><br>  <b>- Where are you planning to receive content from?</b> <br>  - We are going to pay content builders.  That is, it will be professionals. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://siteheart.ru/">Siteheart.ru</a></b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur site is a product and service at the same time.  We provide the opportunity to embed in your website a billing system integrated into the chat.  Ways to monetize the project - a percentage of each payment that is made through our system, and paid services of the call-center.  The product is distributed mainly by selling it to large customers.  We do not feel the need for current investments, rather we are looking for a large strategic investor. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>- How are you doing with licenses for communication services?</b> <br>  - We have everything done via the Internet. <br><br>  <b>- Does your project have a license to accept payments?</b> <br>  - Yes, we have such a license. <br><br>  <b>- What is the essence of the product?</b> <br>  - This is an online chat that turns the operator into a sales assistant and allows him to conduct sales.  At the same time, the completion of the online store website is minimal. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.pokupator.ru/">Pokupator.ru</a></b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is the place where visitors come to buy something, and where the seller comes to offer something.  Sellers here are fighting for the order of the buyer.  Our main goal is to eliminate the possibility of fraud in sales.  In this regard, our main problem is the attempt of some online stores to work with us on the principles of ‚Äúcunning marketing‚Äù.  It is solved by the fact that we encourage the consumer to report all cases of fraud using all available communication channels. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>- Do you think that the market is ready for your service?</b> <br>  - Yes, we think that way.  And especially this contributes to the crisis.  Now the competition for the buyer will increasingly increase, and the stores will start to fight for the customer. <br><br>  <b>- How will you work with an increase in the number of users?</b> <br>  - Now we have two operators, but the system is scalable and can grow with the growth of transaction volumes. <br><br>  <b>- How do you attract online shopping?</b> <br>  - At the moment we have about 80 stores.  Previously, we went to them ourselves, and now, when we started, they go to us. <br><br>  After the completion of the first part of the seminar and a break, during which, in essence, there were ‚Äúsession sessions‚Äù - backstage meetings of participants according to their interests - Nikita Khalyavin, founder of the <a href="http://professionali.ru/">Professionalet.com</a> website, nominee of the Runet 2008, spoke to the audience. At the beginning of the report Nikita apologized for a slight delay: ‚ÄúToday I was late because of the pleasant complexity - we had a server because of the large number of visitors.  All, of course, has already been restored.  Today Professionals.Ru have reached their peak over the period of the site‚Äôs existence. ‚Äù <br><br>  Next Nikita Khalyavin touched the history of the project Professionali.ru. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNetwork Professionals.Ru is a network for experts grouped by various fields of activity.  The idea was born to me last summer, when I came to Moscow from Riga.  My first problem was that I did not know where to find business partners.  I saw that this niche was free, that the idea could be implemented, then I wrote a business plan and began to visit all my friends and ask who could give them money.  That is, I started from my circle of contacts, but then I went out to professional investors.  The most important thing is the experience that I received when I was refused.  If I now come to any venture capital fund with ideas, the likelihood that I will get the money is very high. ‚Äù <br><br>  After the speech of the founder of the project Professionali.ru, the creators of the startup <a href="http://waptalk.me/">WapTalk.me</a> told about the development of their project - they also took part in previous meetings.  The presentation by the <a href="http://news-reader.ru/">News-reader.ru</a> website <a href="http://news-reader.ru/">developer</a> , a project that serves to facilitate the aggregation of news RSS feeds from various resources, was also interesting. <br><br>  At the end of the meeting, participants traditionally discussed the past event and talked about possible steps to improve Startuppoint.  In particular, as one of the proposals, the possibility of applying to the RMA company with a request to invite to the meetings expert teachers whose reports would be of interest to the participants was considered. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/vitakimov/StartupPoint5">PHOTOS</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47060/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47060/</a></p>
