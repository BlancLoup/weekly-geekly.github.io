  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google vs. Microsoft</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Thursday, November 30, I was at HSE at a meeting with <em><a href="http://news.yandex.ru/people/leonov_vsevolod.html">Vsevolod Leonov, the</a></em> head of <a href="http://www.msn.com/">MSN</a> in Russia at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/rus/">Microsoft,</a> and <em><a href="http://news.yandex.ru/people/dolgov_vladimir.html">Vladimir Dolgov,</a></em> CEO of <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google-Russia</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Vsevolod came earlier, sat down on the table and was not at all interested in telling about the arrival of a new player on the Russian market.  Snobbery emanated from him, and ironic notes were heard in his voice every now and then.  About <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/">Yandex, the</a> head of MSN said that the leader of the Russian search is not our competitor.  "We will not search for, but implement various services, for example, MSN and <a href="http://www.live.com/">Windows Live</a> ." The general impression from this unnecessary performance was sent by a Microsoft trinket to have an opponent of Google. <br><br>  Vladimir Dolgov was delayed by the beginning of the event.  Leonov even tried to pin him up, that "they say Microsoft is late everywhere, and here and there: Google, it turns out no better."  The controversy that began, Dolgov quickly stopped: "I got here using the cards provided by Microsoft."  Although, I personally do not remember these. <br>  The Google presentation started (it was a PowerPoint presentation, and not a tedious Microsoft voice), and the speaker spoke very interestingly.

      All Google started on 15 computers.  The idea of <a href="http://news.yandex.ru/people/pejdzh_larri.html">Larry Page</a> and <a href="http://news.yandex.ru/people/brin_sergej.html">Sergey Brin</a> was as follows: download the entire Internet to your computer and optimize information.  To their great regret, the Internet grew much faster than they could download it to themselves.  Then they came up with a search script that searches for new sites and puts them in a special registry.  Instead of 15 computers, Google now has 450,000 servers worldwide.  It is the second largest IT company in the world after Microsoft.  But it is worth considering that Google makes its money on the Internet. <br><br>  Also liked the scheme of the company Google.  It sounds like this: 70-20-10.  So, <br>  70 - 70% of the time an employee of the company devotes his main job duties. <br>  20 - 20% of the time is engaged in a project that has good potential and can become one of the official Google services. <br>  10 - 10% of the time you can do anything: sit on the Internet, go for a walk, talk on the phone on personal affairs or DO INNOVATIVE PROJECTS, which has not yet received any approval or funding from management. <br><br>  For example, as a result of 10% of free time at work, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa blog was born, which is very popular in Brazil, and Google, of course, makes its money on it. <br><br>  Vladimir also talked about the effectiveness of advertising.  Showed the steps of evolution: <br>  Media ‚Üí Outdoor advertising ‚Üí Radio ‚Üí Banners ‚Üí Search advertising ‚Üí <b>Contextual advertising</b> ‚Üí Blogs <br><br>  Google now earns on contextual advertising, introducing various mechanisms in this technology.  "And let the Spout be engaged in blogs in the <a href="http://www.sup.com/">SUP</a> e." <br><br>  The AdSense service also faces various problems.  For example, the problem of localization.  Dolgov had a case where an Israeli complained about AdSense, they say, it‚Äôs not convenient for you.  As it turned out, the Hebrew words are longer than in English.  Therefore, the restriction on the number of initial characters does not allow for the effective placement of ad headlines.  Moreover, it‚Äôs not the end of the ad that gets, but the beginning (read Hebrew from right to left =)) <br><br>  There was also a ‚Äúsupport group‚Äù, as I called it - the guys who laughed at Leonov‚Äôs flat jokes.  They asked absolutely idiotic questions.  Respondents constantly referred to each other and did not give clear answers. <br>  I liked only the presentation of Google and the competent performance of the head. <br><br>  It‚Äôs not for me to judge the scope of Google‚Äôs entry into the Russian market.  Visible or not.  Will they take traffic from Yandex?  Or remain at the previous 15%. <br>  At the very least, google spoke in Russian in February 2006. This means that the script now understands cases, endings and other nuances of the Russian language. <br><br>  <a href="http://news.yandex.ru/people/nosik_anton.html">Anton Nosik</a> live on <a href="http://rbc.ru/">RBC</a> (‚Äú <a href="">In Focus</a> ‚Äù program): ‚ÄúGoogle has come to Russia ?!  Come on  He occupies a room below us in the Smolensk passage.  Google is simply represented in Russia. ‚Äù <br><br>  At the end of the post I would like to play with you.  What are the 3 most popular queries on Google? <br>  1. You would never guess for yourself. <br>  2. A word of 3 letters. <br>  3.
