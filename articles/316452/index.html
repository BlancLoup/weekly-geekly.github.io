  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is Microsoft Office 365 and how can it help the company?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Many Office users find it hard to understand what <a href="http://www.comparex-group.com/web/ru/enterprise-agreement/products/cloud-services/office-365/office-365.htm">Microsoft Office 365</a> really is.</i>  <i>He is often associated with the "classic" Office suite.</i>  <i>Therefore, users believe that they just get Word, Excel, PowerPoint and other applications "from the cloud."</i>  <i>But it is precisely this aspect that has new additional advantages.</i>  <i>Anton Naydel, a specialist company COMPAREX technology Microsoft, will tell you what they are.</i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc051c">1.1.</font>  <font color="#cc051c">What is the difference?</font> </h2><br>  Although Office 365 provides the actual Office suite, it is only part of the proposed components.  The real advantage is often underestimated or even omitted.  My personal opinion is that Office 365 creates an integrated and strategic direction within the enterprise.  In addition to features such as Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, or Skype for Business Online, Office 365 provides security features, data analysis, project work, online communication, social networks, and more. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#cc051c">1.2.</font>  <font color="#cc051c">What are the benefits of subscribing to a cloud service such as Office 365?</font> </h2><br>  There are a number of reasons.  Here are some examples: <br><br><ul><li>  The company wants to focus on core business, which makes a profit.  For most enterprises, this will require the creation and maintenance of a very complex IT infrastructure; </li><li>  Ensuring the availability and uninterrupted operation of the IT infrastructure will be too expensive for the company; </li><li>  The company does not have the human resources necessary to operate a complex IT infrastructure; </li><li>  The company wants to reduce costs, for example, for <a href="http://www.comparex-group.com/web/ru/enterprise-agreement/licenses/open-licenses/open-licenses.htm">software licenses</a> , the amount of memory for countless mailboxes and corresponding archives; </li><li>  The company decided to always use the latest software versions, but avoids any action to always check for the latest updates in its IT infrastructure; </li><li>  The company plans to work with third parties without incurring additional costs for licenses or security. </li></ul><br>  This is just a small selection of standard situations.  A much larger number of scenarios is possible if we consider the advanced features offered by Office 365. You can only answer the question of whether Office 365 meets the needs of a company by carefully examining the available functionality, possible restrictions, necessary efforts, integration complexity and a preliminary estimate of costs.

    <h2>  <font color="#cc051c">1.3.</font>  <font color="#cc051c">Why do companies use Office 365?</font> </h2><br>  We come back to the question of why we need to implement Office 365. Within the framework of this publication, it is impossible to give any definite answer to this question.  On this topic you need to write a whole book!  Therefore, we consider one example. <br><br>  Let's look at a medium-sized enterprise in the automotive industry.  Of course, the company must have a reliable IT infrastructure.  Therefore, to create a suitable IT environment, resources, technology, and budget are allocated.  In addition, in order to be reliable, up-to-date and always accessible, it must also be easy to maintain.  As our examples, we will look at maintenance and relevance.  Indicators in these two areas may be as follows: <br><br>  Service: <br><br><ul><li>  to provide proactive protection against downtime; </li><li>  to ensure effective work; </li><li>  to ensure their safety. </li></ul><br><h4>  How about relevance? </h4><br>  It is not only update management or security patches.  This is a question of creating a modern workplace. <br><br>  This is only one side.  The other side sets an even more difficult task for the company.  How can I introduce the concept of using employees' own devices (BOYD) without accepting it forever?  How soon can I deploy a new Office, and will it compare with my server?  What resources and budget do I need to manage such projects? <br><br>  There are many arguments in favor of new software.  Consider a couple of examples. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc051c">1.4.</font>  <font color="#cc051c">One software life cycle</font> </h2><br>  Let's take a look at how new versions or IT solutions are implemented in a company: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/729/323/f7b/729323f7b5c54122a98f18cd454a6033.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Source: Microsoft.</i>  <i>Software life cycle</i> <br><br>  2008: introduction of a new software solution that meets the expectations of its users.  In most cases, a few years after the introduction, nothing has changed.  This is due to several reasons: <br><br><ul><li>  No budget; </li><li>  No resources; </li><li>  No managerial expediency. </li></ul><br>  Therefore, the software remains in operation until the company stops it.  This may be affected by users or lack of further support. <br><br>  In 2008‚Äì2014, new software versions with advanced functions appear on the market.  IT decides to skip these versions.  As a result, received the following disadvantages: <br><br><ul><li>  Users are unhappy; </li><li>  New components are not available. </li></ul><br>  Moreover, it is becoming increasingly difficult to switch from the outdated version to the new one, if you skip several intermediate versions.  There are more than enough examples: from Server 2003 to Server 2012, from Office 2007 to Office 2016. And so on ... <br><br>  Using Office 365 allows companies to always use the latest software, without having to complete most migration projects or attract significant resources.  The latest version of Office, Exchange, SharePoint or Skype for Business products is always available.  That is why companies should opt for Office 365. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/316452/">https://habr.com/ru/post/316452/</a></p>
