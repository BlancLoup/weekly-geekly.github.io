  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The effect of saving and loading the game state on the game process</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  Despite the fact that the function of saving (save) and loading (load) of the game state (game state) refers rather to the system functionality, in certain cases they can also be viewed in the context of game design, as influencing the mechanics of the game process. <br><br>  The main thing that can be said about these functions is that they directly affect the ability to make the right decisions, without receiving penalties.  By fully controlling these functions, the player can ideally go through the whole game without receiving a single damage, or losing a single life, a penny of money, and the like.  Thus, it can be said that saving and loading affect both complexity, leveling all dangers and fines, and efficiency, if the game is played for a while and the state of time is also saved and restored. <br><br>  In addition, saving and loading allows, in principle, to avoid such a state as losing (game over).  This means, of course, not a failed attempt, but the impossibility of winning, not starting from the beginning.  From death as a result of falling into a pit, saving and loading do not save. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Saving and loading as a difficulty factor </h4><br>  In some PC games, there is a return to the ideology of consoles: the process of loading and saving is done in such a way that in case of an incorrect action the player has to roll back and repeat the passage of the section again.  At the same time, unlike some console games, as a rule, an infinite number of attempts is given.  To accomplish this, the interface eliminates the possibility of managing state preservation and transfers it to the game process itself as checkpoints.

      The first attempt to force the abandonment of F5 / F9 (author's note: a frequently used abbreviation for quick recording and quick recovery of the game state) in my memory was <b>Diablo II</b> <sup>(Blizzard, 2000, PC / MAC)</sup> , but it used <a href="">automatic state saving every 5 minutes</a> , that is, control points were arranged in time.  Saving in the menu was left only in the form ‚ÄúSave and exit‚Äù. <br><br>  Tier points are implemented, for example, in games such as <b>BioShock</b> <sup>(2K Boston / 2K Australia, 2007, PC / XBOX / PS3)</sup> , <b>FEAR</b> <sup>(Monolith Prod./Sierra Ent., 2005, PC / XBOX / PS3)</sup> and <b>Far Cry</b> <sup>(Crytek / Ubisoft, 2004, PC)</sup> .  When a certain level is reached, automatic saving takes place.  This kind of game-state management increases the complexity also due to the fact that right before the forced saving you can make erroneous actions (spend all your cartridges or health) that can be fixed only by passing the next level section.  This must be remembered by the game designer so that this method of saving does not lead to the need to start the game again. <br><br>  <b>Trine</b> (Frozenbyte, 2009, PC / MAC / Linux / PSN) implements a recovery mechanism from control points in the event of the death of the main characters.  Any surviving hero resurrects the rest.  In this case, a special penalty is applied - the minimum level of health of the resurrected characters.  Control points are magical objects, and in general the game‚Äôs universe is filled with magic, so it‚Äôs not surprising that characters can rise again. <br><br><h4>  Saving and loading as a factor of efficiency </h4><br>  The number of saves and downloads (rather than the first rather than the last) is sometimes taken into account when evaluating the effectiveness of the passing game, when calculating the top score.  Each save is a penalty in the calculation and, as a result, reduces the number of points.  Loading the game affects less or no effect at all.  This approach has been applied in <b>Space Rangers</b> <sup>(Elemental Games / 1C, 2002, PC)</sup> for the highscore table. <br><br>  In the above case, it is necessary to pay attention to the presence of an autosave mechanism in the game and take it into account separately, both from the point of view of efficiency evaluation, and from the point of view of influence on complexity. <br><br>  If the estimated factor is time, then saving / restoring is usually not performed, since using this mechanism without limit, you can achieve the minimum transit time at lower cost than without it.  In this case, either the control points are used (the countdown continues) or the level restart (the countdown begins again). <br><br><h4>  Multiplayer gaming sessions </h4><br>  In some cases, for example, in a multiplayer game, states cannot be saved.  As a rule, it concerns real-time strategies and shooters.  This is primarily due to the competitive mode.  It is hard to imagine a football match, which stops at the 22nd minute, and after three days they continue with the same arrangement of players and their physical condition.  Similarly in eSports. <br><br>  In addition, there is the complexity of the simultaneous onset of different players and rests on both the architectural and technical features, and in human psychology. <br><br>  In turn-based strategies, on the contrary, saving is welcomed by all means, since the length of gaming sessions can be very long.  There are no difficulties with simultaneous start, as there is no real time.  Players each wait their turn, indicating pre-readiness for the game. <br><br><h4>  Limit the use of save and restore </h4><br>  In some cases, it may make sense to limit saving and restoring by time (no more than N minutes), number (no more than 3 times per level), or level segments (for example, only be kept out of combat).  However, such restrictions, however, like any others, must be measured seven times before being cut off. <br><br>  Control points can also be restricted in use and saved / restored only during the game session.  When you exit the game level will have to pass again. <br><br><h4>  It is interesting </h4><br>  In the good old <b>System Shock 2</b> <sup>(Irrational Games / Looking Glass Studios / EA, 1999, PC)</sup> , a method of recording and restoring was directly integrated into the gameplay, and I would even say in the game atmosphere and the universe.  At the levels there were checkpoints in the form of special DNA replication booths (DNA replication chambers) that resurrected the hero in case of death.  Although in general, the game state management system <a href="http://boards.ign.com/system_shock/b7574/76577707/p1/">there was, to put it mildly, strange</a> . <br><br>  In the indie game <b>Braid</b> <sup>(Jonathan Blow / Microsoft Game Studios / Number None, 2008, XBLA / PS3 / MAC / PC / Linux)</sup> , the state recovery system was solved in the most original way (in my opinion) on the present day - there just happened a time reversal and the player himself could choose the starting point from which he could continue.  True, this was not a feature of the game state management system, but rather a side effect of game mechanics.  However, successfully performed the role of F5 / F9. <br><br>  In <b>Jagged Alliance 2</b> <sup>(SirTech Software, 1999, PC), the</sup> mode of impossibility of saving during the battle is even put into a separate level of complexity ‚ÄúIron Will‚Äù.  Such techniques allow you to increase the "sporting" interest, but carry another danger - the passage of particularly difficult places with a large number of attempts can discourage the player from the desire to play further.  As a rule, the inclusion of such modes is saved along with the game state and you can turn it off only by starting the game again. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>About the author:</b> <br>  I have been interested in games as a player since 1993, as a developer - since 2002. I am developing as a game designer (general game design, UX design, level design, consulting). <br>  Recently I worked on the following projects: <br><ul><li>  (iOS) Finger Physics (2009), physical puzzle, as a game designer; </li><li>  (iOS) Finger Physics: Thumbwars (2010), physical puzzle, like a game designer; </li><li>  (iOS) Viking Tales (2011), arcade-adventure, as a game designer; </li><li>  (iOS) Cut the Rope (2011), arcade puzzle game, as a level designer and beta tester; </li></ul><br>  Currently working as a game designer in one of the advertising agencies, making games and writing TK for applications for iPhone / Android.  In addition to game design, I am interested in designing user interaction, in my spare time I draw prototypes of applications that I would like to see. <br><br>  <b>About publication:</b> <br>  The article claims to be a reference material and was once conceived as part of a certain cycle under the general conditional name ‚ÄúGame Mechanics.  Handbook of game designer ".  There are intentionally omitted parts relating to user interaction, as well as the technical part, dedicated to what and how to save.  For this, a separate part is assumed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127520/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127520/</a></p>
