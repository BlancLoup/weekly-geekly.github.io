      We spent a lot of time talking about the future, and thought that it would be very nice to try to predict the 2015 trends from five partners of our foundation - <a href="http://www.emcap.com/people/gordon-ritter/">Gordon Ritter</a> , <a href="http://www.emcap.com/people/jason-green/">Jason Green</a> , <a href="http://www.emcap.com/people/brian-jacobs/">Brian Jacobs</a> , <a href="http://www.emcap.com/people/kevin-spain/">Kevin Spain</a> , and <a href="http://www.emcap.com/people/santiago-subotovsky/">Santi Subotovsky</a> - about developing corporate technology topics <br><br>  <b>1. The industry focuses on vertical cloud solutions (‚ÄúIndustrial Cloud‚Äù), which will create even more opportunities than horizontal solutions offer.</b> <br>  Gordon Ritter's partner fund was at the very heart of this shift in the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2014/03/25/industry-cloud-rising-five-hallmarks-of-an-industry-cloud-company/">industrial cloud</a> .  He noted that ‚ÄúThe successful breakthrough of companies such as Veeva Systems, Guidewire, and Opower, indicates upcoming trends that may change the current paradigm in the coming years." <br><br>  <b>2. Companies will start paying for corporate mobile apps.</b> <br>  The prospect of mobile computing has increased dramatically when Apple has greatly expanded smartphones.  There are still enough niches where you can build enterprise applications.  It practically works for 80% of the corporate market, which is still not included in the corporate IT system. <br><br>  General partner Kevin Spain said in the past ‚Äú <a href="http://www.kevinspain.com/the-mobile-enterprise-opportunity/">corporate mobile forum</a> ‚Äù: ‚ÄúThere is a huge opportunity to be useful for 2.5 billion employees who are not sitting at the desk. If you take a payment of $ 40 per year from an employee, then we will get the opportunity to earn an additional $ 100 billion on corporate technologies. I predict that we will see more corporate mobile examples in 2015 that will get real profits. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>3. Consumer trends will move beyond the corporation.</b> <br>  We love helping to mutate large user solutions into corporate ones (Facebook -&gt; Yammer).  General partner Jason Green believes that such things will gain speed in 2015: ‚ÄúCorporate technologies need constant improvements - we expect to see successful game mechanic experiments in corporations such as <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/facebook-prepares-a-business-product/%3F_r%3D1">Facebook</a> recently <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/facebook-prepares-a-business-product/%3F_r%3D1">announced</a> .  I think this will also work for wearable devices.  I predict that Apple Watch will do the same for iPad devices for tablets. " <br><br>  <b>4. The Internet of Things market will begin to evolve, creating a foundation for consumers and corporate segments.</b> <br>  Internet of things has great potential for corporate users, and general partner Brian Jacobs thinks that corporate examples will arise in 2015.  ‚ÄúI expect that next year we will see exciting examples, especially when we realize how important these things will be.‚Äù  We are optimistic about drones or unmanned vehicles that will become very valuable to corporations.  Partner Kevin Spain: ‚ÄúI expect to see how new devices and drones will revolutionize industries such as agriculture and farming, where replacing traditional approaches is very expensive and difficult.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>5. Google glasses will start working in healthcare</b> <br>  Although Google Glass is designed for consumers, we will see exciting applications in other areas in 2015, especially in healthcare, where doctors often have both hands, which can really help them in their work.  Partner Kevin Spain: ‚ÄúDoctors using <a href="http://www.augmedix.com/">Augmedix</a> solutions for Google Glass tell us that they would never refuse it.  They get an extra two hours a day, which they can devote to their patients, instead of filling out special forms. <br><br>  <b>6. Bitcoins will create serious precedents, spreading beyond the US</b> <br>  Partner Santi Subotovsky believes that there will be changes in 2015, all the prerequisites for which have already been created, but this will not happen in the US: ‚ÄúNow the basic infrastructure for bitcoins has already been created, in 2015 we will see many applications on this platform.  There are hundreds of international founders creating bitcoin applications and at least one will be big in 2015. <br><br>  <b>7. We are starting to see glimpses of productive technologies in the UI-less world.</b> <br>  The general partner Gordon Ritter thinks about the future, where user interfaces are gradually receding into the background.  He says ‚ÄúAll the time we‚Äú tap "and type in our phones and computers become useless - to increase productivity, we need new ways to extract the maximum in minimum time. In 2015, we will see innovations that will become the basis of the UI-less future." <br><br>  <b>8. 2015 will be the year of the return of venture investments</b> <br>  There is a debate about whether or not we are now in a browser, and 2015 will be a big year for returning venture capital investments.  General partner Jason Green says: ‚ÄúThe markets are now very sensitive, because there has been a big increase in the technical industry and we are now seeing big risks associated with stabilization, which will cause many to leave.  All these factors will form the basis for return on investment in 2015. " <br><br>  General Partner Brian Jacobs: ‚ÄúRight now we have a healthy IPO market and I anticipate a lot of mergers and acquisitions of large software companies, which will lead to consolidation of the industry during this year.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>9. $ 10 billion - new $ 1 billion.</b> <br>  Either you agree or disagree with the estimate of startups received today, but there are no more disputes that the estimate is $ 1 billion.  no longer cool.  General partner of Jason Green: ‚ÄúIt looks weird, but I think $ 10 billion is a new $ 1 billion.  Current standards require several billions, not one. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>10. Visual Urls (.photography, .florist, .wine, etc.) will become popular</b> <br>  The year 2015 will be a significant year when the Internet protocol names will move beyond .com, .net, .org.  Hundreds of visual domain names were published in 2014, and in 2015 we will see widespread use by companies such as Google, Donuts, and others around the world. <br><br>  Sign up and be sure to get cashback from your online purchases at <a href="http://kubish.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_content%3Dfooter%26utm_campaign%3Dit-trends-2015">kubish.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246893/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246893/</a></p>
