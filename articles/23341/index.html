  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Windows 7 concept</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We can‚Äôt touch Windows 7 with our hands, but we already know what the new OS will be based on.  The so-called ‚Äúpillars of windows 7‚Äù - the concept - are described by the aeroxp.org browser.  Below I will give a squeeze of five notes with AeroXP, which outlined the main ideas, the embodiment of which we will see in Windows 7. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <em>I have expressed my opinion in italics.</em> <br><br><ol><li>  <strong>Data security</strong> <br>  Data must be protected and once again protected.  And so on two times.  AeroXP does not report anything new, but it assumes that the new security scheme will pay special attention to external media. <br>  <strong>Responsiveness.</strong> <br>  In Vista, frequently used applications are preloaded by the system into memory in order to reduce the time of the first program launch.  Windows 7 extends this idea and transfers it not only to media applications, Internet surfing, but also to the whole system. <br>  <em>I dare to assume that access to any frequently used function or file will be faster.</em> <br>  <strong>Improved convenience when working with tablet PCs.</strong> <br>  Apparently, MS intends to gradually move away from the well-established tandem mouse + keyboard.  M + K scheme will be expanded to use gestures and touches.  In this light, Microsoft Surface is gaining more weight. <br>  <strong>Wireless connection.</strong> <br>  Simplified network deployment.  Increased reliability.  More convenient connection - both manually and automatically. <br>  <strong>Network profiles.</strong> <br>  It is supposed to minimize user actions when moving from network to network.  Ideally, the system itself will determine whether you are at home or at work, and then download the appropriate hardware profile.  The development of existing technology. <br>  <strong>Power Management.</strong> <br>  Windows will be optimized to use minimal mobile hardware as efficiently as possible. <br>  <em>It sounds good, but does not cause optimism.</em> <br><br><br><ol><li>  <strong>Updates.</strong> <br>  Windows Update in Vista already downloads updates not only for the system, but also the necessary drivers.  In Windows 7, they promise to do everything that has long been implemented in Linux - centralized updating of all applications, systems and drivers in one place. <br>  <em>In my opinion, a very useful innovation.</em>  <em>I want to believe that we will see him.</em> <br>  <strong>Easy upgrade.</strong> <br>  If earlier the user did not always understand which of the PC components he needs to replace and why, then in the new OS Microsoft is going to make the upgrade a more transparent and simple process. <br>  <strong>Windows Online.</strong> <br>  Online Knowledge Base, download resources and even assistance in choosing the right machine for a specific user.  In general, the system will differ little from the existing one. <br>  <strong>Community.</strong> <br>  The user will be able to upload information about his system for viewing by the community.  Windows Experts will help resolve current problems and answer questions. <br>  <strong>For family.</strong> <br>  Parental controls introduced in Vista will be extended.  The possibility of introducing blacklists for adult sites is being considered. <br>  <em>Children, of course, do not care.</em>  <em>But an adult full list of "bad" sites will be very useful.</em> <br>  <strong>Embedded applications.</strong> <br>  WordPad, calculator, Paint and other built-in tools that have not changed for ten years, will be improved. <br>  <em>Personally, I hope that, for example, Paint.NET will be the replacement for Paint.</em> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/7e7/1b3/064/7e71b3064083a82991f9146e0d902e4d.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10">

    <br><br><ol><li>  <strong>‚ÄúThis desktop is made for me!‚Äù</strong> <br>  The thing that I use must fit me.  In the case of Windows 7, the workspace can be completely redone for yourself. <br>  <strong>Cultural features.</strong> <br>  This refers to cultural differences between countries.  The user can not only set the language and time zone, but also select the so-called ‚Äúmarket theme‚Äù, which will reflect the cultural characteristics of a particular country. <br>  The author suggests that this will accelerate the expansion of Windows on computers of the third world. <br>  <strong>Access data from anywhere.</strong> <br>  The development of remote access.  Working with documents on a remote computer will look as if you are working with them locally.  The data transfer will be encrypted.  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãOffline Files will also be developed. <br>  The author suggests that remote access to home resources will be tightly integrated with Windows Live. <br>  <strong>Movable personal profile.</strong> <br>  Another feature that has tight integration with Live ID.  IE bookmarks, site passwords, perhaps even a whole user profile will be moved and accessible from anywhere. <br>  <em>The idea is wonderful, but it is not very clear how the security situation will be.</em> <br>  <strong>Home Networking.</strong> <br>  Simplified home network deployment and connectivity.  Some resources will be automatically shared, for example, printers.  Work data will remain confidential. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/b2f/632/6c0/b2f6326c05cba138139722b555933a6f.jpg" width="450" height="370" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br><br><br><ol><li>  <strong>HiFi graphics.</strong> <br>  It is supposed to be optimized for high resolution displays. <br>  <strong>Smart House.</strong> <br>  Wireless connection between devices and access to media data on them.  MS already has Windows Media Center Extenders, as well as Windows Media Player Sharing.  Also, the new scheme will include mobile devices. <br>  <em>Here, I somewhat freely translated Home Media Streaming, recalling the project ‚ÄúSmart Home‚Äù by CNews.</em> <br>  <strong>Improved media playback and display.</strong> <br>  Nothing new here.  Apparently, the Media Library scheme will be expanded. <br>  <strong>TV.</strong> <br>  There will appear mechanisms for access to any type of television: digital, cable, satellite or conventional (in our understanding).  Perhaps the emergence of premium services. <br>  <em>I look forward to adding the word "three-dimensional" to the list of supported TV.</em> <br>  <strong>Sound.</strong> <br>  The underlying Windows Vista stack will be reworked. <br><br><br><ol><li>  <strong>Data Recovery</strong> and <strong>Diagnostic and Health.</strong> <br>  Shadow copies, easy backups, reliability monitor, NAP - everything that was rich in Vista.  Significant changes from the current situation is not planned.  It may be easier to use the old features. <br>  <strong>Less UAC.</strong> <br>  Many actions will no longer require administrative access, for example, a change of DPI.  As a result, the UAC window will appear much less frequently.  In a corporate environment, this means less administrative effort. <br>  <strong>Migrating</strong> from Vista to Windows 7 will be much easier than migrating from Windows XP to Vista.  The browser is not sure about the normal migration of applications. <br>  <strong>Reduced TCO, increased reliability.</strong> <br>  Administrators will be able to deploy Windows 7 faster, thereby saving the company money.  At the same time, the network built on the new OS will be more reliable. <br>  <strong>Devices will just work.</strong> <br>  It is assumed that all devices will work without additional effort from the user. <br>  <em>Beautiful, but almost unattainable.</em> <br>  <strong>Quick install.</strong> <br>  The Windows 7 development team set out to achieve a complete installation in ten minutes with one reboot. <br>  <strong>Reducing IT costs.</strong> <br>  Improved group policies, expanded PowerShell.  This will save the command line.  For system administrators, a set of cmdlets will appear in the OS bundle - simple system configuration scripts. <br>  <em>I note that to Windows Server 2008, such cmdlets already go a separate disk.</em> <br>  <strong>Improved security of corporate data.</strong> <br>  Thanks to an improved audit, you can control which applications were launched and which data was accessed.  It is possible that you can even see the list of functions used in the application. <br><br><br>  Push. <br>  I think the concept of Windows 7 was not much different from the concept of Windows Vista.  Most of the ideas did not see their embodiment.  Nevertheless, it is interesting to me to find out how the future OS looks at least on paper. <br>  Some points seem interesting to me.  For example, centralized Update or moved bookmarks.  I hope that these functions will actually be implemented. <br>  In some points, I frankly do not believe.  For example, in the absence of problems with drivers or efficient use of hardware resources. <br>  Integration with Live ID.  Why not?  Just to ensure proper security. <br></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23341/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23341/</a></p>
