      An interview with me356 was posted on e-catworld.com (May 21).  The translation was made with the support of the magazine unconv-science.org. <br><br>  <b>What prompted you to start working on LENR replication?</b> <br><br>  From the very beginning, I was interested in alternative energy sources.  I wanted to be completely independent from the current power plants.  Later, with the appropriate knowledge, I began with repetitions, such as: Joule Thief Ringers, static electricity capture, ground batteries, etc.  With more or less success.  Once I saw the LENR and the work of Andrea Rossi.  I was immediately amazed, but there was not too much time for closer study.  Finally, Alexander Parkhomov's replications appeared, and I realized that I would repeat this.  It was a motivation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Can you say anything about your name: me356?</b>  <b>What is the reason that you do not disclose your real name?</b> <br><br>  It took me 2 seconds to create such a nickname.  There is nothing hidden.  Used only in the LENR area.  I had many reasons to remain anonymous.  I was sure that one day, it [LENR] will work.  It is just a matter of time. <br><br>  <b>Can you tell us a little about your experiments - how much time do you devote to this, and how often do you do experiments?</b> <br><br>  My business takes about 16 hours from me every day, including weekends.  I can always work if I want.  There is no such thing as ‚Äúwork finished‚Äù.  It must be constantly improved - competitors do not sleep.  It gives me enough money for everything I need.  But without free time it is quite difficult to do something else.  So I have to work even more if I want to do something else or accept a compromise (which always has negative consequences).  From the start, the LENR experiments were pure hobbies.  Now I spend a large enough amount of money to buy everything I need (especially materials). <br><br>  Since  we (in the company) have a very good experience in global business, we are working on new products, we can potentially also introduce something else.  For example the reactor on the LENR principle.  I do not depend on any investor or any grant, so I can spend as much on research as I need, and if there is success and a place for a product, it will become a reality.  If something does not work, there is no reason to worry.  We can work on the rest as usual.  So I can really do what I dream about. <br><br>  <b>When you talk about your business - is LENR a part of your business, or separate from it?</b> <br><br>  I can not disclose these details.  When needed, additional people will be recruited.  Soon the fully working prototype will be completed, then the situation may change. <br><br>  <b>What motivates you to continue your work?</b> <br><br>  Make the planet cleaner, better world, stop using fossil fuels, interest. <br><br>  <b>What do you think about the ‚ÄúRossi effect‚Äù (Ni-H-Li LENR)?</b>  <b>Is this effect real?</b>  <b>If so, why?</b> <br><br>  There is no doubt that he is real, at least for me.  I was sure that he was working from the moment I heard about it. <br>  At the moment, I made a lot of reactors, which gave a sure answer, where all ‚Äúno‚Äù were excluded (many times).  I can't be sure anymore, this is reality.  If this is not the case, then something in the universe is really strange. <br><br>  <b>Can you give brief information about the parameters in your replications (temperature, type of reactor, efficiency, etc.), or perhaps a link to a document?</b> <br><br>  Temperature (core) in the range of 600-1500 ¬∞ C, depending on the reactor.  Type of reactor - at least 4 different designs.  There are advantages and disadvantages of each option (design).  One of them is ideal at high temperatures, the other gives good efficiency, the third can be used for different types of products, another one has very good thermal convection characteristics, etc.  Efficiency - above 2. I do not know the upper value, because very often the reactor melts in a few seconds.  It may even be 10 (efficiency), but this is only a guess. <br><br>  <b>The first noticeable replication of an E-Cat-like reactor was the work of Alexander Parkhomov in early 2015.</b>  <b>There were many researchers interested in trying to repeat.</b>  <b>What do you think about the work of Parkhomov, and why do you say that people do not waste time trying to repeat his technique?</b> <br><br>  Replication without knowledge of the process is practically impossible.  Easy to build and very, very easy to fail.  It is like shooting blindly.  This is good for Rossi, but not very good for those who want to make a successful replication. <br><br>  <b>Do you think there are simpler methods than the Parhomov method to get positive results?</b> <br><br>  Already published reports that are not based on the work of Parkhomov.  Unfortunately, this is completely ignored.  As far as I know, nobody tried to repeat them. <br><br>  <b>Can you provide links to already published reports to which you refer?</b> <br><br>  Essentially, every report that has been published is helpful.  I do not want to point to any particular. <br><br>  <b>You said that there are two important parameters that are key to get successful replication.</b>  <b>Can you clarify?</b> <br><br>  Unfortunately not at the moment. <br><br>  <b>Will there be a moment when you share with the public, what are the critical parameters - if so, when will this happen?</b> <br><br>  Yes, I would like to share the details that allow for successful replication of at least E-Cat-like reactors.  The main problem is security.  When I will be completely sure that what will be disclosed is safe, I will publish these details.  LENR has so much potential that we cannot even imagine.  I believe that it will be used everywhere. <br><br>  <b>What do you think is the key to successful replication of E-Cat-like reactors?</b> <br><br>  Patience and time. <br><br>  <b>What other types of LENR reactions did you try to repeat, and what results did you get?</b> <br><br>  The current results are very good, but because of this there are technical difficulties that I have to solve.  It is quite difficult, but once they are all resolved, it will be just fine.  Then he will be able to allocate power at least 10 W, at least 10 kW - without any problems.  Progress is very fast at the moment - the only thing is that it takes a long time to wait for the necessary parts to arrive in order to complete some improvements. <br><br>  I spend hours thinking about a solution.  Then there are days for implementation to determine if this is really a good solution.  There is one prototype that I am very pleased with - it can be produced very cheaply and it will provide a stable output (thermal energy), but there is a problem with overheating in some areas that should not be too hot. <br><br>  <b>If there are things that you are not ready to disclose, you can explain the reasons why you do not want to do this?</b> <br><br>  Safety, security, patents, risks, and others. <br><br>  <i>(end of translation)</i> <br><br><h5>  <b>A photo</b> </h5><br>  Photos taken from the forum, where me356 talked about their experiences <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a8/8d5/41c/9a88d541c8da49a8a8f97170dc75fe5c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc6/b63/489/dc6b63489a834399b32796f359d31943.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/47f/c09/de2/47fc09de23e84287bd1b207f5f7307c3.jpg"><br><br>  Comments: <i>Reactor A (20160501-172719) right before triggering the excess heat.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It is a balmer series.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It is not possible to describe with a words.</i>  <i>Separated into a thin slices (chunks).</i> <br><br><h5>  <b>Is me356 real?</b> </h5><br>  Always when people play for their nicknames - the question arises - is there any real person who hides behind this nickname.  But he met at least <b>Bob Greenyer</b> .  Here is what he said: <br><br>  <i>Bob Greenyer (22 May 2016):</i> <br>  ‚ÄúPhysically 3 times over the past year.‚Äù  We provided a lot of materials, equipment, equipment, equipment, equipment, equipment, equipment, equipment, equipment, equipment, equipment. other parties. <br><br>  Celani wires (Constantan + Hydrogen) and Li Al Ni Hydrogen research.  Beyond one doubt. <br><br>  It was a couple of experiments and there wasn‚Äôt a lot of experiments. ‚Äù <br><br>  Now to the question - who is Bob Greenyer, and is he real :) <br><br>  Bob Greenyer is the founder of the Martin Fleischmann Memorial Project <a href="http://www.quantumheat.org/">www.quantumheat.org</a> - the goal of which is to openly explore the LENR effect.  And that year he came to Moscow to meet with Alexander Parkhomov, and made a <a href="http://my.mail.ru/mail/andrey_dolgorukiy/video/2/2.html">report on his project</a> at the seminar. <br><br><h5>  <b>Patent</b> </h5><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db1/ae9/72a/db1ae972a46b4df5a19cf9ab467db5ec.jpg"><br>  Already after the interview, on June 2, a <a href="http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO2%26Sect2%3DHITOFF%26u%3D%252Fnetahtml%252FPTO%252Fsearch-adv.html%26r%3D1%26p%3D1%26f%3DG%26l%3D50%26d%3DPG01%26S1%3D20160155518.PGNR.%26OS%3DDN/20160155518%26RS%3DDN/20160155518">patent</a> was published by a Japanese professor on the subject of plasma.  And some believe that the experiments that conducted me356 may be similar to those indicated by this patent.  And in particular, p. 0134 says ‚Äúthe output energy exceeding the output energy‚Äù. <br><br><h5>  <b>Interview</b> </h5><br>  As a continuation of this interview, <b>an interview with a Russian lenr-experimenter</b> is planned, which is among the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275724/">15 experiments</a> in the last publication.  He is not hiding behind nicknames, and is ready to answer questions - write in the comments (or in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1O_-MGKANKSIvSzsYKsiMuTVdc-fZTQXVKQTPK1ex4iM/viewform">questionnaire</a> ). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394741/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394741/</a></p>
