VeriSign told how it happened. <br><br>  In 2013, <a href="http://domainhit.ru/news/1663/">the CM.com domain was deleted</a> .  Satoshi Shimoshita, the owner of the domain since 2004, simply did not extend his registration on time, so the registrar deleted it.  Given the huge cost of such a domain, the actions of both parties look very strange. <br><br>  But the continuation of the CM.com story was even more unusual. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After deleting a domain, it cannot be re-registered according to the VeriSign rules, since all two-digit domains are reserved.  Remote domains also fall into the category of reserved.

      However, at the end of last week, the CM.com domain was unexpectedly registered in the name of CSC Domains.  According to VeriSign, the basis for this was the decision of the court. <br><br>  The fact is that until 2004, the owner of the domain was Michael Berry from San Diego, and before him - the company Internet Holding Group, now known as the Branded Holding Group.  In the period from 1998 to 2001, the domain was stolen from her account with Network Solutions registrar: someone sent a message to the registrar by fax on behalf of the domain owner. <br><br>  And now, 13 years after the theft, Branded Holding Group filed a lawsuit demanding the return of the domain stolen from it.  The lawyer of the company explained such a long interval between the domain theft and the claim by the negligence of Network Solutions and the inability to engage in legal proceedings due to financial problems.  As a result, CM.com remained registered to Michael Berry. <br><br>  The plaintiff drew attention to the fact that the previous owner of the domain Satoshi Simoshita used it to send spam for commercial purposes for more than ten years. <br><br>  During this period, the domain was registered with another registrar, and when Network Solutions (which now belongs to Web.com) was recently sent a notice of the claim, she did not respond to it.  For this reason, the court decided to return the rights to the CM.com domain to the claimant. <br><br>  Filing a lawsuit 13 years after the offense leaves many questions, since the respondent is no longer an interested party in the issue at hand.  The judge simply accepted as a fact the charges against which the respondent‚Äôs party did not present any arguments. <br><br>  The company Branded Holding Group is engaged in the domain business, and in her name are registered double-digit domains rg.com, mb.com and uf.com.  There are many other valuable names in her portfolio. <br><br>  Perhaps, after this incident, other domain thefts committed many years ago will emerge, and their former owners will demand rights to them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/248679/">https://habr.com/ru/post/248679/</a></p>
