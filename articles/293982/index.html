Do I need to look for the 25th hour in a day?  Is it important to fix your tasks and clearly follow the plan with the smallest detail 5 years ahead?

People have lived in their rhythms for centuries and also suffer / enjoy their own characteristics as we do.  Methods of fighting corruption in China, pensions in Greece, siesta in Spain, working day in the Czech Republic.  What do we want to be?  Where do we go?  We have national peculiarities, we live in a country with a constantly alternating climate, in cold weather we are active and mobile, in the heat - activity decreases.  This gives the body time to rest, time to practice itself and spending time without benefit, but with dedication to your own self.  I personally can not work all year round with the same efficiency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/912/c67/f41/912c67f41445e486a09347de619bb36f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This is the first factor that personally for me calls into question the construction of certain world standards in the ideal.  How does one know from the other side of the ball how best it works here? <br><br><h4>  Who am I? </h4><br>  Almost all management methodologies are written for rationals.  But this does not mean that there is not a single manager of the irrational in the world.  From the point of view of the rational, the irrational is a dolt.  But it is not.  This is a certain personality type, character class, role in the game, which has excellent innate abilities that the rational does not possess.  An experienced leader and team leader must have such a person in his team in order to cover all possible situations in his activity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/2c6/ae4/da3/2c6ae4da354cb3496be0c2b2a92507bc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I will not delve into the comparison of these two types, you can read about it in the link below. <br><br>  In the meantime, this is the second factor, which for me destroys the next item of the component of a successful person: the myth that it is always necessary for everyone to plan for the long term and to the smallest detail.  No, plans should not be abandoned, but for certain types of personalities, it‚Äôs enough to jot down a few points and they will still be ready to change them, so they will even like it more. <br><br><h4>  Me again? </h4><br>  Then there will simply be a stream of thoughts on the subject of laziness and procrastination, which the ‚Äúdisease‚Äù of modernity is actively popularizing.  Many believe that these are your blame on the Internet with cats, flash toys and social networks, and also messengers, iPhones and news feeds.  By the way, what do we have on twitter?  I'll come back ... Everything is in order, as always everything is fine. <br>  So what are we here for.  Well, yes, in general, one philosopher (Nietzsche) said: <br><blockquote>  Anyone who cannot devote two-thirds of his time to himself must be recognized as a slave. </blockquote>  24 \ 3 = 8. If you have never reproditized during a working day, reduced the time spent on food and other needs for a minimum, then you inexorably strive to become a slave.  Do you want this so much? <br>  ‚ÄúLaziness is the engine of progress,‚Äù and procrastination is only a branch of it, this is my opinion.  Probably there are more terrible manifestations of it, destroying the personality, entire companies, cities, worlds!  But I have not heard about this. <br>  The essence of man is always striving along the path of least resistance, minimal action, and maximum idleness. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/bf7/5fc/164/bf75fc16423f3fa6f5b7708e781993d8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Laziness - can serve as an indicator of body fatigue, it is not news for anyone that peak concentration over a task can last no more than several tens of minutes.  The gaps between these peaks can be filled, of course, by reading useful literature, studying useful knowledge.  But will this not increase the gap between your ability to concentrate?  Try, then tell. <br><br>  Surely you remember the moments when you were desperately hurrying to deadline and working in the literal sense of the word, oh no !, the whole 8 hours out of 15 spent at work, but how did you feel after that?  Did the desire to increase a little more than usual intensify? <br><br>  At all times, even without seals on the Internet, there have been and will be quitters and lazy people.  And also there have always been and will be hard workers who, without any of your GTDs, will plow 12 hours a day on weekends, to their uncle or to themselves. <br><br>  It is only necessary to grope that golden mean, which is suitable for YOU.  How many minutes a day you can safely spend on cats.  Do not forcibly deprive yourself of a minute of idleness, sacrificing your concentration and the ability to think soberly.  Learn to be friends with your needs by compromising.  But do not forget about your efficiency, which you contribute to the success of the common cause. <br><br><h5>  Hortmann's theory.  Theory of the hunter and farmer. </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/6ba/f91/102/6baf91102abfc16cc587f8c06d06272e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Who is that?  Director of large companies, a writer, NLP practitioner, with some awards in the field of homeopathic medicine, radio presenters and much more, plus seeing the Dalai Lama and the Pope of Rome.  In general, the bad will not advise!? <br><br>  So, he has a very attractive hypothesis about another so-called "disease" that fits perfectly into our modest conversation - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD);  English  Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). <br><br>  I quote from Wikipedia, suddenly it will be blocked again: <br><blockquote>  Hunter and Farmer Theory - a hypothesis proposed by Tom Hartman to explain the causes of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (in children - approx. Transl.) And ADD in adults, interpreting them as the result of adaptive behavior.  Hartman notes that most or all of humanity has been nomadic hunters and gatherers for thousands of years.  Then this standard gradually changed with the development of agriculture in most primitive societies and most people on earth became farmers.  Over the years, most people have adapted to growing crops, but people with ADHD have retained some of the traits that hunters have.  A key component of the theory is the proposal to consider the concomitant ADHD aspect of ‚Äúhyperfocus‚Äù as a gift or advantage.  The theory also explains the difficulty of concentration and inattention in people with ADHD, as well as a number of other characteristics, such as neglect of social norms, weak organizational skills and planning ability, disruptions in the sense of time, impulsivity and impatience.  It is noted that in cultures that existed at the expense of hunting and gathering and preceded agricultural crops, the hunter (most often the man) needed ‚Äúhyper-focusing‚Äù much more than the farmer (most often the woman).  Hartman argues that this sexual differentiation is confirmed by the fact that ADHD occurs in boys more than twice as often as girls. </blockquote><br><br>  And, well said.  Now the owners of ADHD and the irrationals must straighten their shoulders.  Not so bad? <br><br>  Thus, we come to the third factor, which for me personally nullifies the absolute danger of laziness and procrastination in a person, if we are able to use it correctly and in time, as one of the components of the whole mosaic of individual personality characteristics. <br><br><h4>  Well .... </h4><br>  If you fell unpopular personality type, not a pop role in this life, this is not a reason to bend and learn from a neighbor who does not look like you.  However, this is an occasion to learn how to use its features.  The first step to this is self-awareness.  Who are you?  The second step is to make a choice in favor of their features and abilities, what you get is better than the main mass.  Develop these qualities and apply in practice.  So that any reproach or complaint (and they will be and you already know about them in advance), you could always adequately object to a successful example from your personal life or a reasoned objection. <br><br>  There is no one pill for all diseases.  Yes, and tablets are not always needed, if you are a victim of marketing and think that you need to increase immunity all year round and drink live bacteria, then continue to break yourself and become another, that person on the other side of the monitor, instead of looking for your potential, individual unique gift and develop the abilities inherent in you. <br><br>  When writing this article materials from sites were used: <br>  <a href="http://bookap.info/socionica/stratievskaya/gl6.shtm">bookap.info/socionica/stratievskaya/gl6.shtm</a> <br>  <a href="http://big-frog.livejournal.com/90458.html">big-frog.livejournal.com/90458.html</a> <br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BE%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B8_%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D0%B5%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%BE%D1%82%D0 % BD% D0% B8% D0% BA% D0% B0_% D0% B8_% D1% 84% D0% B5% D1% 80% D0% BC% D0% B5% D1% 80% D0% B0</a> <br>  <a href="http://ru.knowledgr.com/17374645/%25D0%259E%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%2593%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">ru.knowledgr.com/17374645/%D0%9E%D1%85%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%9F%D1%80 % 82% D0% B8% D0% B2% D0% 93% D0% B8% D0% BF% D0% BE% D1% 82% D0% B5% D0% B7% D1% 8B% D0% A4% D0% B5 % D1% 80% D0% BC% D0% B5% D1% 80% D0% B0</a> <br><br>  ps and yes, instead of working, I wrote this article ... may my boss be just! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293982/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293982/</a></p>
