The most pleasant thing for me in this news is that one of the first stretch-heads is the enrichment of the Godot engine with templates and materials for creating adventure games.  The only bad thing is that the fees, despite the small amount requested, are sluggish.  11 days left, and only a third is collected. <br><br>  <b>Kickstarter page:</b> <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/942343365/the-interactive-adventures-of-dog-mendonca-and-piz">www.kickstarter.com/projects/942343365/the-interactive-adventures-of-dog-mendonca-and-piz</a> <br>  <b>Demo of the game</b> (User: ‚Äúlorenzo‚Äù Password: ‚Äúlamas‚Äù; Without quotes; Linux version is hidden in Windows version): <a href="http://www.dog.okamstudio.com/">www.dog.okamstudio.com</a> <br>  <b>Godot website</b> : <a href="http://www.godotengine.org/wp/">www.godotengine.org/wp</a> <br>  <b>Wiki on the engine on GitHub</b> : <a href="https://github.com/okamstudio/godot/wiki">github.com/okamstudio/godot/wiki</a>

      <b>UPD</b> : The minimum required amount of $ 30,000 collected! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df0/449/ce5/df0449ce555940d785a564bb51e735e4.jpg"><br><br>  It is a little about personal acquaintance to the Godot engine. <br><br>  Having got acquainted with him recently, I quickly became convinced that it was very pleasant and extremely convenient to work with him.  In fact, this is not only an engine, but also a rich in capabilities tool for game development.  And although the user interface is a bit confusing in some places, most of them are intuitive.  This is facilitated by a convenient concept of organizing the game of scenes, consisting of a hierarchical structure of nodes (nodes), each of which represents different entities, such as Sprite, Object with collision calculation, Animation (not only changing frames, but also any change of any parameters of objects) , Form, Vector and so on.  Moreover, the scene is not only a game level, but also a convenient means for decomposition.  You can select any repeating set of elements in it and use it in other scenes an arbitrary number of times. <br><br>  Inside, Godot uses its own scripting language, gdsript, in syntax much like Python.  Here is an example of the code describing the movement of the node by pressing the key: <br><br><pre><code class="hljs swift">extends <span class="hljs-type"><span class="hljs-type">KinematicBody2D</span></span> const <span class="hljs-type"><span class="hljs-type">MOTION_SPEED</span></span> = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">160</span></span> # pixels/second <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">_fixed_process</span></span></span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">(delta)</span></span></span></span>: <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span></span> motion = <span class="hljs-type"><span class="hljs-type">Vector2</span></span>() <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> <span class="hljs-type"><span class="hljs-type">Input</span></span>.is_action_pressed(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"move_up"</span></span>): motion += <span class="hljs-type"><span class="hljs-type">Vector2</span></span>( <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>, -<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>) motion = motion.normalized() * <span class="hljs-type"><span class="hljs-type">MOTION_SPEED</span></span> * delta move(motion) <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">_ready</span></span></span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span></span></span>: set_fixed_process(<span class="hljs-literal"><span class="hljs-literal">true</span></span>)</code> </pre> <br><br>  Unfortunately, I started to get acquainted with game devs at all just now, and I mostly have the first one, so it's difficult for me to compare it with other engines - the same Unity.  I only know that, unlike the above, Godot works natively under Linux, since Godot, as a tool, is written on its own engine. <br><br>  Now about the bugs.  Yes, they are.  For example, my randi function returned the same number, while randf worked properly.  And a couple of times in the process of working I had a feeling in the incorrect operation of the engine.  However, the engine is rapidly being developed, and, in an extreme case, it is open source. <br><br>  It also has good, as yet poor, but constantly expanding documentation. <br><br>  In short, that's all, and now let's get to know a little about the game that is being developed on this engine. <br><br><h3>  Plot </h3><br>  The game itself is an old school adventure and is based on visual novels (read comics) of Portuguese origin.  The plot tells about the legendary detective occultist Mendoza, nicknamed the Dog and the pizza delivery man, who by the will of fate turned out to be involved in the investigation of paranormal phenomena. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/936/872/737/93687273735f4374b05da3db3f8dc1f2.jpg"><br>  <i>That's what Dog Mendoza and the pizza peddler do in the comics of the same name</i> <br><br><h3>  Setting </h3><br>  For centuries, Lisbon was the scene of a clash of great forces, a powerful capital and a strategic point separating the Old World from the vast ocean that opens the way to the New World.  Today, little has changed.  A seemingly ordinary city hides beneath itself, like an iceberg, a huge web of secrets.  For the supernatural beings of this planet, Lisbon is a new Casablanca - a territory not owned by anyone, where the policy of the hidden world has developed, and ordinary citizens try in vain to arrange their lives among the participants in the conflict.  This place is a refuge for hordes of vampires, goblins and other similar creatures, but, as befits a similar place, it constantly falls under the influence of the interests of various political trends, secret societies and organized crime.  In Lisbon, every shadow has eyes, and every eyes are witnesses of new secrets. <br><br><h3>  Characters </h3><br>  <b>Joao Vicente "Dog" Mendoza</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df3/6f1/328/df36f132876f4ae0a5ceb2d7ad5fa1e2.png"><br><br>  Much can be said about the Dog.  At first glance, he looks, and he behaves like a lazy, unclean, slightly crazy charlatan.  But it is worth to be in his company a little longer and you will recognize in him a fierce warrior, tempered in countless battles, with a stern disposition and in some way a noble soul.  Much of it is still shrouded in mystery for us, but what floats to the surface makes one feel imbued with respect.  On top of that, he is a werewolf in full control of his curse, which he uses as a link between the world of people and the world of monsters.  His combat experience and knowledge of the secret world of Lisbon makes him the right person to go to if you have problems with unknown forces. <br><br>  <b>Euriko aka Pizza Delivery Man</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a18/5dc/9b3/a185dc9b39b84567adef67bb3a3135e8.png"><br><br>  Eurico - ordinary, no outstanding, a young man.  He is not particularly smart, and, if we talk about cleanliness, then he also has an appearance that is not very pleasant or very repulsive.  Unremarkable in all senses, his dedication to the secrets of the occult world happened by pure chance, so he clearly does not belong to this world.  In fact, he is you.  This is the connection between the player and the new world. <br><br>  <b>Pazul</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49c/abd/806/49cabd80629e47f1a1b46ee51f0b6a6b.png"><br><br>  Pazul is a six thousand-year-old ancient demon sharpened in the body of a little girl.  Not the best choice.  He is a long-time partner of Doga and in a good mood assumes the role of his personal assistant.  Being quick-tempered and laconic, his actions speak for themselves. <br><br>  <b>Gargoyle</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b5/ccf/88f/6b5ccf88ff5c43dd88228e7e4a2afd53.png"><br><br>  Gargoyle he ... he just is.  More precisely, there is his head, because the Dog decided that it would be fun to separate it from the body.  Do not worry, the body will eventually grow.  He is what is called the local Hochmach, although the Dog does not particularly pay attention to him.  He is much more capable and dexterous than trying to show.  Sometimes. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  Having played the demo version, I can say that everything looks very nice to the eye.  Sense of humor in the game is.  Riddles are not trivial, but not too complicated.  The soundtrack is extremely well chosen.  True, such a game clearly lacks the voice of dialogues, but one of the stretch-heads is just English dubbing. <br><br>  In general, the game and the more so the engine on which it is developed is more than worthy of attention. <br><br>  I wish the authors good luck! <br><br>  PS: Many thanks to <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/p0figist/" class="user_link">P0figist</a> for stylistic edits and one more person who wished to remain anonymous, for edits in translation. <br><br>  PPS: Godot on Habr√© already had two interesting articles from Comrade <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/zenogears/" class="user_link">Zenogears</a> : <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212583/">Part One</a> ;  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212837/">Part Two</a> ; <br><br>  PPPS: The title picture, the one on the right, I made myself using a screenshot from the game and the Godot engine itself.  It does not reflect the actual development process of the game being described, but was made in order to show how the engine toolbox looks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362275/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362275/</a></p>
