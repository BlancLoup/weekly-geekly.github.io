Big stage.  Official opening.  Vipy.  Among the VIPs is Sergey Sokolov, Microsoft‚Äôs chief executive officer for Russia (or the CIS ‚Äî the devil knows ‚Äî I don‚Äôt remember).  Could, perhaps, not to come.  Because all the same, all the attention of Alan Yustau - senior vice president of Google.  Eustace said something like: ‚ÄúGoogle ... blablabla ... 15 years ... blablabla ... gladly support ... blablabla ... thanks to ROCIT, hello to Moscow ....  The blablabla ... we will definitely support the next time ... ".  Actually, this programmatic speech has become one of the main events of RIW.  Google‚Äôs booth (it‚Äôs written on the Google wall, but there‚Äôs nothing more. Such a booth) gathered more people than all the other booths combined.  And on Microsoft, somehow somehow immediately scored. <br><br>  Well, that is understandable - among other things, Google's PR specialists tried - Maslov with partners, associates, subordinates and a support group that joined them, grabbed journalists (especially TV reporters) like a vulture - and for shkirman to Mr. Eustace.  Around the crowd.  In the far corner, lonely representatives of Microsoft hang out lonely.  First day - ek (in any case, the official part).  A curtain.

      <b>Day two</b> .  It seems to be planned Borodino (options - Vatreloo, Tsushima, Alyosha Popovich and Tugarin Snake, Dobrynya Nikitich and Snake without tugarin) - Silverlight against Flex.  The best minds of Adobe and Microsoft converge on the big stage and popularly explain why they are the best (offices, of course, and not minds - the minds of the best according to the criteria of the sample) (for example, I hoped to listen firsthand about flex I had such an infa at one time, but nothing super-revolutionary at the present stage! sic - you should not arrange a holivar - except for asynchronous data exchange with the server initiated by the server, I haven‚Äôt found it there yet).  Well, every freebie is distributed to the heap.  That is, it was planned, it was planned, but only Adob ‚Äã‚Äãactually appeared for the battle.  First - Cherkashin (lit in the "blue hall" - the neighboring backs were empty).  Then Enrique Duvos.  Cult adobovsky evangelist.  This one didn‚Äôt sing and dance (although it would probably be quite normal for an evangelist).  Duvos is on stage, a naked girl is roaming the desktop on the big screen (‚ÄúAnd let's all call Kelly and she will come to us again‚Äù), and Google‚Äôs website (sic!) Is spinning in the washing machine.  And, to the heap, the round table of Adob‚Äôs Russian partners is about how cool Adob‚Äôs community in Russia is (i.e., like, how cool they actually are).  It seems that Adobe had some other events, but I did not get there.  Meanwhile, the stand of the microsoftware silverlight (in the very corner of the pavilion), disappeared somewhere ... <br><br>  Well, that is, on the one hand, it is clear - PR specialists of RIW are engaged in Adobe.  An oil painting - Gurov, with partners, associates, subordinates and a support group that joined them, grab journalists (especially TV reporters) like a vulture - and for shkirman to Adob's tops.  Around the crowd.  In the far corner, lonely representatives of Microsoft hang out lonely.  The second day - ek (in any case, the official part).  A curtain. <br><br>  <b>Third day.</b>  <b>Epigraphic.</b> <br>  <i>‚ÄúDoctor, why do you all hate me ...‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Gone in the ass, fucking crap!</i> <br><br>  The third day for Microsoft turned out as in Montipaytonovskom Grail: "if you now do not get out, I will humiliate you again!" <br>  Round table on ICT in science, education, etc.  etc.  The bureaucrats stupidly and protractedly discuss this very education.  Oleg Syutin (one of the directors of Microsoft in Russia), declared as the main participant, begins the report.  Exactly three minutes later it is interrupted by deputy minders.  Politely so.  Type: "Thank you, sit down."  ‚ÄúBut how is that?‚Äù, Suetin tries weakly to resist.  ‚ÄúObserve the rules!  You are not alone here.  Thank you, I said, ‚Äùthe deputy minister replies.  And another half an hour some hrenoteni.  That is understandable - on such a round table and from Microsoft there would be the same (well, or similar) crap.  But still, in the best traditions of the memory of Rafik Nishanov, ‚ÄúI finished, I didn't finish - the 3 minutes time limit‚Äù ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, okay, not in the first for us,‚Äù say the microsoftovtsy, and at the press conference (at the press center of the ‚ÄúBig Infocom‚Äù).  Three journalists are sitting at the conference (the most famous edition seems to be called the ‚Äúclub of agrarian journalists‚Äù or something like that; no one has heard of the others before).  Microphones do not work.  In the next room is a rock concert.  A curtain. <br><br>  The conclusion from this story is simple and paradoxical.  Google has PR managers - Maslov and partners.  Adob - Gurov and partners.  At Microsoft - it seems like internal reserves.  And it was necessary to rename these same reserves.  For example - Reserves and partners.  And they would be a great joy.  Well, tomorrow (or rather, today) the microsoft will have another attempt to get to this great joy.  Good luck <br><br>  PS Most of the above impressions are my own.  Others (try to guess which ones) are a verified insider. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43175/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43175/</a></p>
