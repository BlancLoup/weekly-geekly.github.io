  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Domain of the Russian Federation - All-Russian hysteria, glee recorders</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Domains of the Russian Federation managed to register more than 294 000 and the increase continues.  During the first day of open registration, 240,040 domains were purchased.  Until the end of November, I think the figure can get to half a million.  (For comparison, there are only 89,000 domains in the su zone, 3.06 million in the ru).  All normal words, the name of medium and small cities, all two-letter and two-character domains are already registered. <br><br>  The PR of the flawed Cyrillic RF was a success.  The first government agencies began to buy, registering not only the names of their companies.  Then cybersquatters set to work, registering trademarks for the domains they needed.  The media and public organizations such as the Vodka newspaper or the Iota N Open Independent Logistics Association (abbreviated: ONLINE) followed this. <br>  When it came to open registration, the real meat grinder began.  The registrar servers simply did not cope.  Ru Center constantly hung, <a href="http://webnames.ru/">RGTIM</a> generally fell regularly, others had no better situation.  The excitement is such that even those who were not going to buy it, and who were going to buy dozens and hundreds of domains.  Commercial organizations are also forced to buy their name, according to the principle - if I don‚Äôt buy it out, what if competitors suddenly take it?  The bulk buys unnecessary domains, keeping in mind the success of the zone RU.  Suddenly in 5-10 years, handsome. RF can be sold for the same money as RU is now.  However, the most delicious domains do not go to these people. <br><br>  Most of all at the registration in the zone of the Russian Federation registrars profited.  And more than other recorders - the all-powerful monster <a href="http://nic.ru/">RU-CENTER</a> . <br>  Let's look at the statistics for the first day of free registration.  294,000 domains registered.  Of these, 49.5% <a href="http://info.nic.ru/node/3403">went to the</a> Ru Center.  This happened at the expense of own capacities (two of their registrars) + technical agreement with four more registrars, according to which they acted in the interests of the Ru Center.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <a href="http://cctld.ru/ru/press_center/news/news_detail.php%3FID%3D971">Statistics of the distribution of names</a> for the evening of November 11.  I think the distribution of forces will not change much further. <br><br>  RU-CENTER - 49.5% <br>  RELCOM - 14.8% (in the interests of Ru-Center) <br>  Hosting Community (R01-REG-RF and CENTROHOST) - 14.3% <br>  REGRU-REG-RF 7.2% <br>  ELVIS-REG-RF 6.2% <br>  NAUNET-REG-RF 5.5% <br>  DOMENUS-REG-RF 5.5% <br>  SALENAMES-REG-RF 4.7% <br>  DEMOS-REG-RF 3.8% <br>  NETFOX-REG-RF 2.7% <br>  REGGI-REG-RF 2.7% <br>  REGISTRATOR-REG-RF 1.9% <br>  REGTIME-REG-RF 1.6% <br>  REGISTRANT-REG-RF 1.1% <br>  AGAVA-REG-RF 1.1% <br>  101DOMAIN-REG-RF 0.4% <br>  RTCOMM-REG-RF 0.1% <br><br>  That is, approximately 147 thousand RF-domains have already been registered through the Ru Center.  Price for partners - 90 rubles.  For all others - 600 rubles.  The partner price was unexpectedly reduced several times before the open registration.  My guess is that the partners submitted more preliminary applications and more domains went to the Ru Center auction (about the auction a little later). <br>  The cost price of the domain for the registrar, as well as in the ru zone, is about 83 rubles.  Suppose that every second domain was bought by partners.  Then Ru Center received from users 50.71 million rubles.  Minus the cost of domains, we get 38.5 million rubles!  Not a bad profit in 1.5 days? <br><br>  In fact, the profit will be higher - we remember about the auctions.  According to the regulations of the coordination center, whoever submitted the application first, starting at 12-00 on November 11, registered the domain.  For this purpose, the registrars collected preliminary applications from their clients. <br>  In theory, Vasya Pupkin submitted an application for Vasya.rf in R01.ru, which means R01 does not accept an application for this domain from other people.  Olya Sinkina submitted an application for Vasya.rf to Regtime and he also does not accept an application for this domain.  At 12-00, the registrars will spam the register of the focal point and whose application will be the first to arrive is well done.  Lucky either Vasya or Ole. <br>  In reality, everything is not so.  Ru Center is a big fan of auctions.  Allegedly in the interests of customers, he decided to accept many applications for the same domain, and register it first on himself.  Due to its capacity, most of the delicious domains were picked up by the Ru Center.  Next will be the internal auction among the company's customers.  Prices there cheat be healthy!  As a result, the domain inherited by the registrar for 83 rubles will be resold for thousands of rubles, and a number of single-word keywords and for tens of thousands. <br>  An auction is an opaque event.  No one has proved, but it is rumored that registrar bots participate in such auctions, filling the price higher.  If the domain is not redeemed by the winner or the vice-winner, then it goes to the open auction of the Ru Center, for everyone. <br>  In addition, even after the sale of the domain at auction, Ru Center will remain its administrator for another year!  Because according to the regulations. RF can not be sold / transferred during the year. <br><br><br>  Regtime also distinguished itself, in fact having failed the filing of applications of its clients, began to offer to buy domains of the form: <br>  DOMEN.KOM.RF <br>  DOMAIN.NET.RF <br>  DOMEN.ORG.RF <br>  The offer looks mocking.  At the Domenforume they <a href="http://domenforum.net/showthread.php%3Ft%3D113010">write</a> that they do not just offer, but register them without the knowledge of the buyer, whose application of the type DOMAIN.RF he could not satisfy. <br><br>  I am sure that registrars (especially among small ones) registered quite a few domains simply for themselves, for further resale.  This is our domain business; registrars are not prohibited to register domains for themselves in any quantity. <br>  The next zone that they are going to promote to the masses is .Moscow.  If it is allowed to create, companies will once again make good money.  The more agiotage, the higher the profits of registrars, the main squatters in the domain market. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108057/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108057/</a></p>
