Video can be recorded using a webcam or mobile phone, and then published in a personal video microblog. <br><br>  12seconds is an analogue of the Twitter service, which allows you to post messages with a length of 140 characters.  Only in this case, we are talking about the video.  When Twitter first appeared in 2006, few people believed in its success and many made fun of it, however, gradually, it became a popular and useful tool.  As a rule, it is used to report operational reports about personal adventures.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  ‚ÄúMicroblogging is really gaining popularity,‚Äù said the founder of 12seconds, Sol Lipman.  However, text messages cannot always compete with video.  ‚ÄúI suppose that the video, if viewed as a medium, is more exciting than the text,‚Äù Lipman believes.  ‚ÄúIf there are any interesting events near me, I would prefer to show them than to describe them.‚Äù <br><br>  The startup was founded a few months ago, solely on personal funds.  According to Lipman, the team includes from seven to ten people, depending on the amount of work, and five of them work part-time.  On July 24, 12seconds launched an alpha version of its service (as a rule, the alpha version offers less features than the beta version) and allowed four popular blogs, including <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a> , to distribute 500 invitations to their readers. <br><br>  Not surprisingly, 12seconds was such a dramatic success among a limited audience.  Millions of people use the Twitter service, and many of them are looking for additional ways of micro-expression.  Liz Loli, director of the Center for Information Technology and Social Studies at the Rochester Institute of Technology, reports that posts with a reference to 12seconds began to appear on the tweeter. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI find it quite entertaining ... I like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãexternal constraints,‚Äù says Loli, referring to the maximum length of Twitter messages, which should not exceed 140 characters and the 12-second video length limit in 12seconds.  ‚ÄúI believe that restrictions only contribute to the birth of creative ideas.  Without limitations, our actions would lose their emotionality and elegance. ‚Äù <br><br>  However, Loli notices that video microblogging does not necessarily become the next stage of microblogging.  12seconds is now trying to circumvent the same rake that keeps video blogging from defeating text blogging: it takes too much time to view a single video post.  Loli says that it takes about 6 seconds to view the entire page of 25 postings on Twitter, and this is enough for her to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe meaning of each post.  In addition, she can view the tweet tape without interrupting other activities, for example, being at a conference.  At the same time, the video requires not only visual, but also auditory attention, and does not allow to catch the meaning of a series of postings, just gliding over them.  ‚ÄúThis is the audio and video vulnerability,‚Äù said Loli.  ‚Äú12 seconds is too long for one post.  On the one hand, it allows you to communicate more directly, but on the other, it is too inconvenient. ‚Äù <br><br>  Lipman hopes that the interest that users have already shown to 12seconds will allow the company to grow.  In the next few weeks, 12seconds will release a special software that will allow third-party developers to create their own applications based on the technology of this startup.  Twitter, by the way, largely owes its popularity to the fact that third-party developers can write their own programs for this service, and thereby promote it.  Actually, according to this principle, the entire social services industry is built. <br><br>  Another lesson that can be learned from Twitter‚Äôs biography is that the sharp increase in users carries certain dangers, as Lipman believes.  Over the past year, Twitter has fallen many times.  One of the reasons for this is that the programming language in which this service is written ‚Äî Ruby on Rails ‚Äî is simply not designed to create large services with high loads, like the one that Twitter has turned into.  Lipman believes that his team uses a different programming language that is perfect for 12seconds tasks, however, this does not mean that the service is immune to problems.  ‚ÄúThat's why we start with the alpha stage,‚Äù explains Lipman.  "First, we have to break in the system and identify possible errors." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bb6/4de/261/bb64de261f0853ab5bdfe68f2914eadf.jpg"><br><br>  <font color="gray"><i>The kitchen at the headquarters of Twitter.</i></font>  <font color="gray"><i>Recently, the project received an additional $ 15 million investment.</i></font>  <font color="gray"><i>Initially it was 5.</i></font> <br><br>  <b>Translation from English:</b> <br>  <a href="http://studio-bloger.livejournal.com/profile">Roman Ravve</a> <br><br>  Especially for <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/worldwebstudio"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b4/e5f/93f/3b4e5f93fec698b310e33c06b7cb2d3e.gif"></a>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/worldwebstudio">worldwebstudio</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37062/</a></p>
