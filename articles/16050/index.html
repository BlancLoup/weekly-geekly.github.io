  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Creative promotions of mobile operators</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> How lucky we are, after all, that those distant nineties finally passed when only well-to-do people could have the advantages of cellular communication.  And in the market that was not yet formed, there was a customer struggle for the operator, and not vice versa.  But, justice nevertheless triumphed and with the capitalism that came to the market of cellular communication came the competition.  Which, at the beginning, announced competitions for someone with a lower tariff, and then, when the services of mobile operators were almost equal in price to the services of ATS, she introduced a new law of survival - the client chooses creativity.  Therefore, today, in our review, we will see what progress our advertising operators have achieved in the field of advertising creativity, and compare, so who is the best at this point in this respect? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Erotic</strong> <br>  And perhaps we will start with the most beloved in our, and not only, the country of erotic advertising companies. <br>  The most popular promoters of cheap communication for the coolest are Tele2.  For example, one of the last erotic actions ‚Äúmade‚Äù not only a wide smile on the face of the male population ... Just imagine: an evening, near the Moscow metro station Mayakovskaya, two model-looking girls wearing miniature shorts of pale blue walked from the hip and a white wrestler, on which in the chest area it was written large: "Relax with me is cheaper!".  Promoters ‚Äúcaptured‚Äù a huge audience of customers, it‚Äôs a pity that the Tele2 logo between the blades was noticed by not all, therefore the girls ‚Äôoffers to‚Äú go in to connect ‚Äùfor the first few seconds caused passers-by to a share of embarrassment and a modest smile.  But, why hide the new subscribers, especially teenagers, the operator still got.  And therefore the action was a success. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/568/f92/f02/568f92f02f3b38caa73ce07145132c9e.jpg" width="226" height="400" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>Viral</strong> <br>  I think that you do not want to switch to other topics for the time being, therefore we will consider a more hot version of erotic companies.  Of course, everyone remembers the movie ‚ÄúBeeline‚Äù ‚ÄúStart with Tens‚Äù.  So, this was just the beginning.  Just a couple of days after the video was released, an obscene version of the video appeared on the Internet, where everything remained the same except for one moment - the girl ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to put on her panties for shooting. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/f1c/35a/563/f1c35a5638d5cabdcbcf8b5fd60bb65f.jpg" width="450" height="360" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Naturally, the delighted Internet public quickly replicated the clip even in the most deserted corners of the network, which caused a mass resonance.  Judging by the quality, the video was not subject to any editing, and this can only mean that Beeline intends to release the video to the network for the purpose of a broad viral company.  Such a knight's move has become especially popular lately.  After all, at minimal cost - as we can see, it is enough to remove an item of clothing or slightly correct the text, the advertiser gets a huge audience reach and a positive image from customers.  And despite the fact that the operator denies everything: <br>  ‚ÄúCurrent graphic editors allow you to work wonders.  And in this case, it is not known who, with their help, decided to strip the heroine in our video. ‚Äù <br>  We can safely put him 5 for courage and perfect performance of the action. <br><br>  <strong>Internet</strong>

      Unfortunately, and perhaps fortunately with eroticism, everything is for today, so we turn to a topic of no less urgent interest - the use of the Internet in advertising.  Computer, and to be more precise, ‚ÄúAlbanian‚Äù slang is so firmly settled in the heads of network users that they are ready to buy everything that is at least somehow connected with this topic.  Therefore, choosing the right moment, the Ural operator UTEL announced the launch of a new campaign with the loud-speaking name ‚ÄúPeschy Ischo :)‚Äù and did not lose. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/507/d83/9fc/507d839fc7fa570b0f8a60725822f82a.jpg" width="450" height="352" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  First, according to statistics, those who want to become a subscriber of a progressive operator have become much more.  But secondly, the rest of the country not only learned about the presence of such a company, but was also ready to meet it in its region with open arms. <br>  Despite the fact that the action is still underway, we can safely conclude that services with a similar name will soon appear with other operators.  After all, free additional advertising on the network has not prevented anyone yet ... <br><br>  <strong>Prize</strong> <br>  And now we will again switch to another type of advertising creativity - competitive promotions.  What not to say, but our people love to find free cheese, even if it frankly lies in a mousetrap.  ‚ÄúAnd what if you are lucky!‚Äù - under the invocation cry, all without looking, they rush into this mousetrap and what is most unusual for the ‚Äúvictims‚Äù - come across.  So it was, so it is and it will always be that way - apparently the gene of freebies has been laid down in man since ancient times and that the most, perhaps offensive, is forever.  Therefore, for lovers of everything at once, be sure to find their own ‚Äúmousetrap‚Äù.  This method is used not only by crooks, but also by decent companies, such as, for example, mobile operators ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/011/482/dad/011482dad39e000b91df786fb3bf1ede.jpg" width="350" height="270" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Most recently, MegaFon widely announced its mobile lottery.  The essence of which was as follows: you need to send an SMS to the short number, costing only 35.40 rubles, and then you had the opportunity to win a ‚Äúclear German car‚Äù.  All would be nothing, but only members of MegaFon can participate in the promotion.  And then, as luck would have it, all sorts of ads, they say, choose what model of Mercedes you want, and how can you resist the temptation?  So people bought new contracts, replenished their balance, forgetting that the action must pay for itself.  As a result, saying goodbye to several cars, MegaFon received not only profit, but also new subscribers.  Thereby proving that this kind of advertising creative, not only has the right to life, but even leadership among its other varieties. <br><br>  <strong>Starry</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  And now we are back to Tele2, which in September of this year made an unusual gift to its subscribers, in the form of bringing the real Italian mafia to Russia, which has already managed to catch the fancy of us on famous commercials. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c2b/837/db1/c2b837db12f9bdbc4436eb39b50457ca.jpg" width="450" height="301" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  The arrival of the main roof of Tele2 was timed to connect the millionth subscriber in the Leningrad region.  However, who would doubt that the Italian mafia will come just like that? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/7e8/239/f97/7e8239f9743b3667dd7af9494d98302b.jpg" width="450" height="301" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Sonny, Tony and Don Gross traveled through the main sights of St. Petersburg, each of which was equipped under a press center, on a chic convertible to the soundtrack of the Godfather, which attracted considerable attention of local residents, many of whom, even throwing all their things were moving carefully behind the gangster machine.  A lot of smiles, balloons, autographs, satisfied passersby - something like this can be summarized as a unique image campaign from Tele2, which ended with great success, which allowed the company to confirm its positive image with subscribers. <br><br>  <strong>Call from Beeline</strong> <br><br>  Not less unique action in the spring of this year decided to conduct Beeline‚Äôs management.  Instead of spending on creating commercials, time spent on TV and other needs not postponed for an advertising campaign, the operator decided to ‚Äúget through‚Äù, or if it‚Äôs more accurate to reach future subscribers directly.  Thoroughly seeding the phones, Beeline employees began to ring up subscribers of other networks in order to make them an advantageous offer, namely to connect to them.  The costs of such calls were small and easily covered by other Beeline subscribers, people slowly, but still connected to the operator, and it would seem that there is happiness.  But it was not there, the raspberry did not last long, and a few days after the launch of the action, employees of the Federal Antimonopoly Service knocked at the door of the operator‚Äôs office and scientifically popularly explained that such a campaign was a violation, so, dear, let's turn off your bells.  And to prove the intentions, a fine of 100,000 rubles was presented. <br>  Moral: Miser pays twice. <br><br>  <strong>Happy end</strong> <br><br>  Having finished with calculations about the benefits of operators, let's finally pay attention to us - simple subscribers.  After all, this is for us to show eroticism for free and arrange lotteries, it is we come up with all sorts of creatives and actions.  In the end, the same we are the judges in the competition operators for the originality.  Therefore, now we can only relax and get ready for the next battle of mobile operators for their subscribers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16050/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16050/</a></p>
