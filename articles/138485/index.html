".  And the result will often be exactly the error <a name="habracut"></a>  , their own mistakes, those on which they love to learn and appreciate. <br><br>  From the interview: <br>  Employer: Tell us about your completed projects. <br>  Applicant: In the past, 4 projects completed on time and successfully, without going beyond the budget <br>  Employer: Have you failed? <br>  Applicant: Well, there was one ... <br>  Employer: And what kind of experience did you get out of it?  just want to make sure that you don‚Äôt step on rake again .. <br><br>  ITIL is developed based on the experience of thousands of companies, their successful implementation of processes and their mistakes, which is why it is called ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù (Best Practice, to understand where the phrase is and not to be afraid of it).  There are already so many mistakes made by companies in the world that if you write about each at least a couple of lines, then more than the ‚ÄúSoviet encyclopedia‚Äù will work out.  Do you think it is not reasonable to take into account the mistakes of others ?? <br>  This ends the background and come to the main premise of the topic.

      Before publishing the material on Habr√©, I always look for the presence of already published and drew attention to how little they write about ITSM and ITIL as a whole, how few translations and links to articles about them, but there they laid the foundation for all the processes taking place in IT and at least become familiar with them, pro use for the benefit of themselves and customers just keep quiet.  But in the ITSM communities the material is unmeasured, and in personal blogs. <br>  Here it is worth remembering about the Knowledge is power card from the <a href="http://www.vanharen-library.net/abcofictanintroductiontotheattitudebehaviorandcultureofictenglishversion-p592.html">ABC of ICT</a> methodology from Paul Wilkinson and Jan Shilt. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e63/9bb/c12/e639bbc126fa966b170fda2310639a32.jpg" alt="image"><br>  It displays one of the most popular mistakes in ITSM - the reluctance to share knowledge, believing that it will make you irreplaceable.  Seeing ourselves in the mirror?  - isn't this the reason for how little material about ITSM is placed on the cake, maybe it should be closer to those who use ITSM?  I dare to disagree with the fact that creating another blog about ITIL or ITSM is effective for popularizing the framework (except for self-promotion, and then, will there be many who remember ITIL blogs here? Especially Russian-speaking). <br>  I would like to believe that this is <s>in no way connected with the maintenance of demand for ITSM consulting and the value of services in this direction, but</s> due only to the fact that sometimes the techniques themselves should be applied, and not only for customers. <br><br>  PS writing a topic inspired by a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/htranslations/138209/">comment</a> to the translation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138485/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138485/</a></p>
