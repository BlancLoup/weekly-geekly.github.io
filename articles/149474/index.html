On the way to creation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Such concepts as leadership, non-linearity, openness, self-organization, creative thinking are gradually beginning to enter into modern management.  It all starts with those companies that have decided not to take ready-made templates and build their own business on their basis, but to create their own internal rules, which as we eventually become, become the benchmarks. <br><br>  The issues of personal effectiveness in one degree or another concern each of us.  Someone is obsessed with these issues and spends a daily struggle with his ego in an attempt to start doing something that he really does not want to do, someone does it more naturally, and every day becomes a day of life, not a struggle. <br><br>  Modern management, like the science of organizing and managing people, like no other discipline, feels so deeply all this confrontation that takes place in a person.  But the neutralization of this internal struggle means that the energy spent on this struggle can be directed to the creation and implementation of new concepts and ideas. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, it has long been understood that it is impossible to impose development paths on any complexly organized system; rather, it is required to facilitate the formation of one‚Äôs own path.  This is not only an evolutionary view of things, these same laws apply everywhere.

      Those who were engaged in biology and biochemistry know that for complex systems there is no rigid predetermination - there are always several alternative ways of development.  It is also known that all living things strive for self-organization, and self-organization is the first sign of the beginning of evolutionary changes.  However, at present, humanity does not have a holistic view of self-organization.  Modern management only approaches the understanding of this issue and is just beginning to learn how to use human resources in a new way. <br><br>  If we shift the experience of the biological evolution of all living beings to management, it becomes obvious that the mechanisms of rigid selection and competition are not the only correct ones and there are dozens of other ways that allow to achieve high-quality results while reducing time and effort. <br><br>  The heuristic potential of leadership and self-organization based on this leadership is not yet fully evaluated and studied.  Management remains linear.  he continues to scare the chaos and lack of control.  Chaos is a purely destructive start.  Self-will was so long and carefully banished from the minds that several generations were grown not capable of openly manifesting their own self. This created a ‚Äúworld of trapped minds‚Äù in which people were taught how to think and reflect, beat their heads with facts and figures and put their lives on reaching others‚Äôs goals . <br><br>  For several years we have been working on a concept that would allow us to get away from the classic linear management.  The result of our work was the emergence of the concept of <a href="http://www.proven-group.ru/pages/%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582">Energy Management</a> , which I will try to describe in the next article.  If I were asked to tell you what the essence of management is to which you need to come, then I would describe it in three words: non-linearity, self-organization, creative thinking. <br><br>  <b>From openness to self-organization</b> <br>  Openness is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the self-organization of the system.  Every self-organizing system is open, but not every open system is capable of self-organization.  It all depends on whether heterogeneities in an open system will form or, on the contrary, dissipate. <br><br>  Linear models allow linear processes to be described, but in the real world, the principle of linearity does not work.  The randomness of the choice of the path of development at the time of bifurcation is inherent in all systems already at the atomic level.  What is called laid by the creator of design.  We can see the realization of this principle in the real world.  In economics, this principle is known as ‚Äúmoney for money‚Äù, psychologists also revealed this pattern and the maximum success in implementation is not those who have tried many times and failed, but those who have already had success, which is called ‚Äúsuccess to success‚Äù .  By the same principle, autocatalytic processes also take place. <br><br>  Linear is used to describe sustainable systems, but who said that sustainability is good and generally possible?  Sustainability is not just stagnation - it is death.  All living things evolve.  And this evolution is due precisely to instability and instability.  Instability is not evil - it is a guarantee of dynamic development.  Only unstable systems are able to spontaneously organize themselves and develop.  Sustainability is a dead end of evolution. <br><br>  Relying on my experience working with a business, I can say that inside any serious company there must be an element that will initialize the continuous withdrawal of the system from the state of equilibrium and check its boundaries for strength. <br><br>  Linear thinking in the modern world is still the dominant type of thinking, but now it is insufficient and may even be fundamentally dangerous in a non-linear world.  It leads to dogmatism and blind fanaticism.  Everything new is born out of chaos. <br><br>  Self-organization is associated with the possibility of choice.  The transition to the paradigm of choice (the implementation of the very non-linear management, or in my concept of Energy Management) will allow the subject to choose for himself his own way of social evolution, to realize his unique probability, which begins at the subatomic level and ends with the manifestation of the transcendental personality traits: logic, thinking , love, creativity, reflection ... <br><br>  Any complex system at a certain stage of its evolution undergoes a certain evolutionary leap, which is a consequence of the system going beyond the sum of its constituent elements.  In other words, the system has a certain new quality, which cannot be reduced to the sum of the qualities of the elements of the system. <br><br>  Take, for example, man.  It is made up of cells and is a complex system that has a new quality that is not found in every single cell of it ‚Äî consciousness.  Consciousness is a new stage of revolution and consciousness itself is the very structure that, like the individual cell, must form something bigger.  Vernadsky calls this something more the noosphere, but the noosphere can begin only where there is thought free thought. <br><br>  Man has already gone through a long biological evolution, then a social one has followed, and now the next wave of evolutionary development is underway - the evolution of consciousness.  This evolution should lead a person to the realization of the role of his own thoughts in the formation of intentions, and the realization of this intention in the material world.  Awareness of the role of thought is the very transition to that subtle world of particles, which lays the realization of probability in the material. <br><br>  Despite the apparent metaphysicality, everything described is quite real, just like the law of thermodynamics is real.  I see the goal of modern business, and its manager's management, to come to a new level of work with the team, which would allow to reveal the potential of each person and unite people in the new field of co-creation.  So I wish everyone as much non-linearity and free play with reality as possible! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149474/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149474/</a></p>
