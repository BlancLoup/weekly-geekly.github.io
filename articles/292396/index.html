And this suggests that "kolbeki" are popular and in demand. <br>  In the end, all callback services are almost the same: they connect the site visitor with the sales department, collect statistics and increase conversion.  The rest is small technical subtleties: variation of settings, telephony parameters, strategy and position of the company in the market, technical support. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68e/439/525/68e439525df34547b20022417576bc9f.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  How to choose the most convenient and necessary option for your site?  We have carried out work more than once in comparison with competitors, and we know how difficult it is to form an objective opinion based on real characteristics.  We appreciate your time and are ready to share the results of our analysis.  The Cashmyvisit team prepared a digest of the most popular widgets, based on the site <a href="http://www.similarweb.com/">similarweb.com</a> , and today we will tell you about the strengths of each of the callback services. <br><br>  <b>Callback haunter</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c2/ab7/280/4c2ab72805064a5cae98c69bb26bebcb.jpg"><br>  CallBackHunter is a pioneer in the field of callback widgets.  Having been on the market for almost a year, Hunter is one of the few widgets that has a broad base of almost 30,000 registered users.  Recently launched a new CallBackHunter 3.0, which promises to connect the client with the manager in 8 seconds;  The previous version offered 26. For the sake of fairness, we note that it is possible to customize any connection time in other widgets too.  The CallBackHunter team and their product won the audience at the International Youth Prize in Entrepreneurship GSEA-2014.

      <b>Perezvoni</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cae/c14/580/caec145807f64745bb46f453660b0fc1.jpg"><br>  Perezvoni was the first widget to focus on deep customer tracking: where it came from, how it behaves, what pages it looks like.  For example, if a client asked google: ‚ÄúWhere to buy ten kilos of buckwheat?‚Äù, The dialog box will read: ‚ÄúWould you like, we will call you back in 28 seconds and tell you where to buy ten kilos of buckwheat?‚Äù.  Perezvoni also has a text change function in the dialog box: the widget re-welcomes the one who came in the second time, or offers to quickly get the necessary information to those who view the pages as a sprinter. <br><br>  <b>Uptocall</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8bc/838/b14/8bc838b140cd464aa0e14a129229d0ce.jpg"><br>  This young service (the company launched the widget in February 2015) has one weighty advantage - the price.  Uptocall tariffs are lower than those of competitors - sometimes even several times.  And the basic functionality is almost the same: integration with Yandex.metrics, engagement tracking, flexible settings.  The latter, by the way, are becoming more and more flexible day by day: news about various improvements and innovations continually appear in the blog of the company-creator.  For example, the color of the mini-widget has become possible to change, or add some more manager numbers. <br><br>  <b>2calls</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf7/5d8/a4b/bf75d8a4be3d4b809c0b790f4bc890f9.jpg"><br>  2calls calls itself not a callback widget, but a "service to increase conversion": its creators immediately make it clear that their main goal is to help make money.  According to the creators, the potential client should be impressed with the numbers: during the entire service operation time, 3,670 sites have connected to it and they have caught 53,000 calls.  In addition, 2calls, judging by the reviews of existing customers, boasts a decent technical support. <br><br>  <b>Chaser</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/360/c6c/335/360c6c335e134181887d31a4f3023a0c.jpg"><br>  The creators of Chaser were the first to create widget templates in which to insert a photo of a person.  And thus, they gave a human face to their dialer service, and their customers - the trust and loyalty of their customers.  By the way, Chaser has been a project of a fairly large Traffic Lab company engaged in Internet marketing since 2003.  So, you can solve all the problems with all your sites in one place at once. <br><br>  <b>Rocket callback</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d47/128/4d0/d471284d0bba403ca4889366114c3baf.jpg"><br>  The creators of Rocket Callback are the initiators of new products in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcustomer service.  So, this company is ready to offer round-the-clock technical support.  Even at 5 am, you can dial the number and clarify: how to make the widget jump out when you want, and not when it pleases.  Calculating the most suitable tariff is also not necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãit is the only one, a fixed price for a certain number of fire minutes. <br><br>  <b>Callbaska</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/243/b65/5c7/243b655c7cb846db914701d6bbfbb67f.jpg"><br>  The service with the touching name ‚ÄúSausage‚Äù will surely attract those who doubt: does the callback widget really need at all?  That's because Callbaska offers 30 test minutes for free.  How much is enough depends on site traffic.  But, most likely, during these XX days you will be able to understand whether you need a callback service and what it should be taking into account the peculiarities of your business. <br><br>  Of course, our digest reveals not all the pitfalls of the callback-services market.  In the beginning, we said that all callback widgets are very similar.  Everyone copes with dialing, recording a conversation, tracking customer behavior and collecting statistics.  Then where, you ask, such a difference in price?  Companies providing their services at higher rates spend more money on design, invest in innovation, provide a more flexible service.  On the monitor screen, the difference may seem big;  but in fact, the owners of sites with little traffic will spend only a couple of hundred rubles more.  But the volume of benefits will be significant. <br>  That is why we tried to highlight those characteristics that really should be paid attention to when choosing a widget.  Decide what is important to you: a solid market experience, thoughtful analytics algorithm, flexible settings, or good technical support.
