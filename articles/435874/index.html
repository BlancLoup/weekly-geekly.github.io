    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Hello, said contact, but I found your phone on hh, and you are not interested in work a bit? <br>  Of course, I agreed.  Announce your offer: what, where and how much? <br>  I carefully buried correspondence with HR, but believe me - there was nothing new and interesting there.  Young HR was <s>not young</s> , moderately good-looking, but she couldn‚Äôt explain at all what such perspectives could be in an organization where I was already interviewed 1.5 years ago, and there they were then offering exactly the same salary and exactly the same conditions as and today. <br>  For a year and a half, a large and promising (TM) organization never bought a coffee machine ($ 500), and did not move from the class office "just half an hour on foot through the snow drifts from almost the farthest metro station."  It did not work out for us to sell out mutual love, but, nevertheless, the correspondence itself made me think, what questions should be asked even before going to the office and on Skype interviews?  I have already written <a href="https://habr.com/post/334212/">what to ask about non-material motivation</a> , but these questions still have to be reached. <br><br>  <b>First question.</b> <br>  In my opinion, the simplest first question to ask for saving both your and other people's time is the question about money. <br>  If HR is unable or unwilling to voice a payroll fork - on the whole, further conversation does not make any sense. <br>  There are, of course, exceptions: firms with a constant recruitment and a well-known reputation as a whole. <br><br>  There are several reasons for this seeming simplicity of the question, and the sharp dislike of HR for such simplicity. <br>  <b>The first reason.</b> <br>  Quote: <i>The main problem of IT people in the Russian Federation is that they are not needed.</i>  <i>In the Russian Federation, there are practically no serious IT businesses, and businesses in Russia are tight.</i>  <i>In government offices everywhere, the approach will ‚Äúcome together‚Äù, therefore</i> <i><br></i>  <i>a) total nepotism (nepotism. Owl <a href="">knows a lot about it</a> )</i> <i><br></i>  <i>b) they don't care for advancement (certificates, skills, knowledge).</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In this case, IT people in the Russian Federation more than necessary, because</i>  <i>a country with a historically strong school.</i>  <i>But they have nowhere to work, so the competition for a place (of course so-so, of course) is above average in Western countries.</i> <br><br>  However, IT does not need somewhere more, but somewhere less.  Where HR is sent for searches without specifying money, the frames are not needed at all.  It happens - maybe you need to imitate search activities, maybe you need to show a thick pack of resumes to some specialist and say what you see, Evgeny V.!  In your place so many people can be found. <br>  The method is certainly not very honest, but about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DMxO4y9Kp5NY">7% of</a> managers can use it and not. <br><br>  <b>The second reason.</b> <br>  No matter what they say in lectures of HR to themselves about intangible motivation and ‚Äúmoney is not the main thing and works only in the short-term version‚Äù, however, non-material motivation works only under comparable or better working conditions.  In the first place almost always and almost everyone has money in the wording ‚Äúno less than‚Äù - <br>  <i>The staff of Russian companies motivates "decent monetary remuneration", and demotivates "incompetent management".</i>  <i>To keep people in the easiest way, by offering them a pay rise, analysts at Hays have established.</i>  <i>The amount of remuneration is both the main motivating and the main demotivating factor for the majority of Russian workers, follows from the results of a study by the recruiting company Hays.</i>  <i>93% of the 3,600 surveyed employees of 486 Russian and international companies operating in Russia, primarily in Moscow, pointed to the particular importance of this factor.</i> <br>  Source: <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/5af58eb99a79476f46f88331">RBC</a> <br>  Since there is no way for RBC to decide when to block something, here‚Äôs a <a href="https://antirabstvo.ru/blog/analitiki-nazvali-glavnye-prichiny-uhoda-rabotnikov-iz-rossijskih-kompanij">spare link</a> . <br><br>  <b>Second question.</b> <br>  The second question is even simpler - who, in fact, are looking for, and did the future manager read the job description? <br>  If HR cannot answer the second question at all, except for ‚Äúwell, there are computers, servers, DHCP, ReFS, Proxmox, NoSQL‚Äù, or confidently answers ‚Äúno, I did everything myself (a)‚Äù - it means that the employee is not really required , there is an image of stormy activity. <br><br>  In such circumstances, asking about studies in the specialty, LCA and others is already meaningless - in fact, what can we expect from an organization where the department‚Äôs management does not care who and how they are looking for HR? <br><br>  It is easier to say (or write) ‚Äúthank you very much, I‚Äôll carefully read your offer a little later and, if it seems interesting to me, I will answer you.‚Äù <br>  It saves time, and yours, and HR. <br><br>  Of course, there is a risk of being blacklisted by ‚Äúwicked and greedy‚Äù - these were recently published for Ukraine, and I have no doubt of their existence in the Russian Federation, but black lists for distribution among organizations where personnel are not needed have value ... only among such same organizations. <br><br>  <b>The end.</b> <br><br>  <b>PS Stream of consciousness about aluminum forks.</b> <br>  TL: DR As always, at the end of the text is a stream of consciousness without any structure. <br><br>  The labor market in IT in terms of system administration in Moscow is in a strange state, or so it seems to me, maybe I just don‚Äôt have enough breadth of coverage, but for a number of links, the picture is similar. <br>  References: <br>  <a href="http://kuzpress.ru/economy/29-12-2018/64899.html">One</a> , <a href="https://rb.ru/news/rossiyane-salary/">two</a> , <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/newspaper/2018/12/03/5bffdf6d9a79472a1871e0e2">three</a> . <br><br>  On the employer's side, sometimes Yaroslavna (or even Natasha Rostova) is crying that ‚Äúthere are no personnel with the necessary qualifications‚Äù.  In general, this is not the case, there are personnel, just the employer is a little silent that the whole phrase sounds like this - ‚Äú <i>there are no personnel with the necessary qualifications for the specified salary, or our HR do something else, but we cannot admit to ourselves</i> ".  According to one of the references there is a complaint of the form ‚Äúwe are not ready to pay as much as they want.‚Äù <br><br>  From the workers' side, it seems that there are no jobs with a salary of NNN (in this case it is not particularly important, NNN is 100 or 500 thousand rubles). <br>  This is also not the case; there are such vacancies, but almost never get into public access beyond a certain amount.  For example, vacancies for 100-150 thousand rubles are found on hh much more often than 2 years ago, there are almost no vacancies for 200+ in public access, although in fact there are such vacancies, and these are not leadership positions.  But, again, you need to understand the owl.  Owl <a href="">knows a lot about it</a> <br>  A similar problem, ‚ÄúI want to receive, not earn,‚Äù unfortunately, has not gone away either. <br><br>  On my personal side, it seems that the labor market in system administration in Moscow (and the Russian Federation) is generally narrowing under the pressure of various factors.  These factors include: <br>  - Stagflation in the economy, including accompanied by nepotism (cronyism). <br>  - The growth of productivity of the equipment, when problems became possible to be solved ‚Äúsimply by purchasing an SSD‚Äù. <br>  - Facilitate the deployment of virtualization systems.  Method XX (and in production) <br>  - Increased availability of clouds and cloud services, starting with Office 365 and ending with AWS. <br>  - Moving non-core spheres to an outsourcing, in modern monitoring and task management services, it‚Äôs almost all the same how many points to follow - 100 or 500, which makes it possible to optimize personnel (more precisely, remove it from Moscow), and in some places remove a woman, put a machine . <br>  - Kroilovo on the ground. <br>  - Reluctance to invest in a specialist as a kroilov subspecies (with variations). <br><br>  About the last two points I will write in more detail. <br>  <b>- Kroilovo on the ground.</b> <br>  The development of demand for IT in Moscow was uneven.  In the wake of oil money and in the absence of such a variety of clouds and tools as it is now, before the crisis of summer-autumn 2008, the demand for personnel grew.  From the moment of the crisis, from autumn 2008 to 2012, the market was, accordingly, crushed by a large number of personnel, among whom were highly qualified personnel (with experience and real certificates). <br>  As a result, among the part of both personnel specialists and HR, there appeared an opinion that there is a good IT specialist on the market, and inexpensively, and there is nothing difficult in finding such a specialist in particular, and in IT in general.  That is, you can hire anyone and his qualifications will be sufficient. <br>  However, at the same time, the flow of specialists from IT administration to related areas has increased (development, testing, and sometimes even in 1s and in accounting). <br>  In addition, somewhere from the same 2008, the outflow of specialists from the Russian Federation as a whole grew (and it did not stop).  By itself, in hundreds of people a year, this outflow is imperceptible, however, never enikei and not younger administrators are leaving - on the contrary, serious specialists leave the Russian and Russian-speaking IT community.  This is indirectly confirmed by an earlier analysis of the blobs ‚Äúin Russian,‚Äù and the sad fate of a previously known site, which, in pursuit of advertising, merged marketing, coworking and space stories, plus headphones with a warm tube sound in one heap. <br>  Unfortunately, such a public analysis (of jobs) is not conducted by the only remaining major portal on work - HH.  With this, the HH portal provides an API for tracking employee loyalty, and it is rumored that the base can be obtained anyway, but there is no public statistics on it, as well as no tools for an employee to assess vacancies. <br>  Perhaps, the statistics on staff outflow can be obtained from the accounting systems of certifications, the same VUE. <br>  Perhaps the outflow of personnel can be assessed indirectly through published lists of various kinds of experts. <br><br>  <b>- Reluctance to invest in a specialist as a kroilov subspecies (with variations).</b> <br>  Another knock at the bottom is heard from the management and the staff, and it is called ‚Äúno need to learn, otherwise it will run away‚Äù. <br>  This is due, in my opinion, to the fact that even cheap ($ 500) training can give the specialist an understanding that he is more expensive in the market than he is offered ‚Äúhere‚Äù, and as a result the specialist leaves after training.  As a result, in the overwhelming majority (in pieces) there are no training organizations, and the implicit (non-advertised) ban is even free education - even though it is online, although there are open pizza-eating contests.  Sometimes it is not even possible to assemble your own stand, at least to check for updates of various services.  Variations are found in the form of a mandatory additional period on the gallery in the form of ‚Äúeither working out for study or returning NNN% cost‚Äù, or a drastic change in the authorities about this seemingly promising, including the approach ‚Äú <i>develop your qualifications yourself, I read books in your years</i> ‚Äù . <br><br>  <b>Total.</b> <br>  Now all of the above gives the results in the form of a knock on the bottom of the species: <br>  ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm a student, I was told to update the test box, we installed it from torrents, we bought SSD, but it still doesn‚Äôt work as it should, help is good, there‚Äôs no money for support.‚Äù <br>  - Oh, there is no frame trouble. <br>  - Oh, what is not clear to learn, they still don‚Äôt add money for certification, 100 (200, 300) thousand don‚Äôt pay anyway. <br>  - oh well, in my age there will be enough work, and there 65 years and a pension, let's live! <br>  - frames in some places NO ALL.  And you are in Moscow, and the tasks are in the regions, so this is your problem,% username%. <br><br>  The last point (frames in some places is NOT ALL AT ALL) should also be analyzed separately. <br>  1. Erosion of personnel from the regions. <br>  Almost all the sensible personnel from the regions either have already settled down normally, or moved to Moscow (St. Petersburg) and then got on the tractor.  Exceptions are few, although they are. <br>  2. Optimization of what is left has led to the fact that there is simply no frame that can do something that is needed once a year.  There is a substitute of his type if necessary, but this ‚Äúsomething‚Äù is not his specialization. <br>  3. The same applies to the maintenance of all small things, such as cash registers, computers, monitors, and so on.  This is small things, but this, too, needs to be known and done, along with this **** touch and at least the same *** accounting system for wine-vodka products, EGAIS. <br>  4. The situation is worsening in spurts, because generally speaking good specialists must say 10 ‚Äútotal‚Äù per 100,000 people, approximately (in the pp 3 market, where there are small things).  The jerk will be at the moment when the next specialist either moves a heart attack, or he moves to Moscow \ Peter.  Immediately, the situation will go down a notch. <br>  For example, take a small city of thousands per 50 population.  It has a conditional network store, any one - little coins - Pyaterochka - magnets - dixie - tape - a crossroads - who else is there.  But there is.  In the store there are cash registers, in fact - small PCs with a printing device screwed on an insulating tape and a card terminal, which somehow send sales reports.  There are SKS installers in the city. <br>  Someone who is able to understand the problem of the ‚Äúprint not print‚Äù level and flash or repair or decide to replace the computer - printer - payment terminal - no longer exists.  There, in general, there is nothing complicated.  But.  But the next shots sit for 100 kilometers.  They don‚Äôt mind driving over these 100 km - you just need to drive two cars along fierce roads (and two because they drive only one car in the summer, and in the winter - well, risk it), and the price tag for their services immediately * 10 - because that two cars and two drivers and risks, and this is a day, and they have current work at the place of stay. <br>  The same with any case is a little more difficult to ‚Äúsaw off with a grinder‚Äù.  Well, yes, there are some personnel to ensure the current functioning, everything else is not or very little.  Not needed. <br><br>  <b>What to do with this, someone might ask, how to live, <i>I would be glad, but ... <a href="http://www.beerpanda.ru/%3Fp%3D164">(c)</a></i></b> <br>  Nothing new has been invented here. <br>  - VUE certification (Prometric, etc) <br>  - IELTS (TOEFL, CELPIP) <br>  - LinkedIn (monster, etc) <br>  - Three widely known outputs. <br><br>  <b>For those who read it.</b> <br>  For many, SUDDEN discovery that the Internet is full of not just courses on YouTube, but ready-made courses, laboratories and simulators, all without the possibility, that is, for nothing. <br>  Without SMS and at high speed. <br>  I will list the most famous: <br>  AWS and Azure.  Suddenly, there and there they give from one month to one year ‚Äúof the type for free,‚Äù however, in Azure, the ruble, the dollar, the dollar will be written off, and then they will be returned. <br>  MS <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/handsonlabs">Hands-on lab</a> <br>  and MS Hands-on lab - <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a> <br>  The above mentioned pizza cues: Microsoft 365 Intelligent Communications Global Azure Bootcamp 2019 Russia <br><br>  VMware <a href="https://labs.hol.vmware.com/HOL/catalogs/">Hands-on lab</a> <br>  and their same <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/vmwaretv">channel on YouTube</a> <br>  and their newer VMAN <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vmug.ukraine/posts/459859591085989">training</a> <br><br>  DSS <br>  List of VSA Virtual Storage <a href="https://www.flackbox.com/list-vsa-virtual-storage-appliances-storage-simulators-san-nas-demos">Appliances and SAN Storage Simulators</a> <br>  Some simulators are just GUI or CLI, some full-fledged virtual machines. <br><br>  Network. <br>  Network simulators are described even here - from packet tracer to GNS3, where even ASAs can be inserted with known tricks. <br><br>  <b>How does all this relate to the original heading?</b> <br>  Simple enough. <br>  The labor market in the world as a whole and in the Russian Federation in particular, is being compressed in system administration, and it is becoming more and more difficult to re-learn.  As a result, it may happen that the choice of work will no longer be, at least some is good, but, in my opinion, this situation should be avoided, and for this to follow both the trends ‚Äúin general‚Äù and your own prospects with terms of growth (both wages and qualifications) and stability.  For this, you need to spend less time on interviews in obviously unpromising places, and even less time on working in such places, if, of course, you don‚Äôt have a desire to suddenly find yourself at 50 years old with the knowledge of a sample of 2005 for an interview to a place where people are not and need. <br>  <b>In my opinion, it is much better when you call or not to call back,% username%</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435874/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435874/</a></p>
