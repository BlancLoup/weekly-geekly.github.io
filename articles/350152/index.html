It has new NVMe disks.  You get good performance "for the same money."  But there are two nuances.  The nuances are as follows: it is good in the ratio ‚Äúcost per GB + performance‚Äù and it is not American, that is, it is suitable for those who are under sanctions. <br><br>  We calmly tested it ourselves, when suddenly a very agitated customer appeared on the horizon.  He had a hybrid storage system with ended support, where the controller flew.  Storage is not the newest and drives a hundred.  Without a controller, performance is very low.  Wait a new six weeks.  Colleagues fought in panic, simultaneously begging us to somehow reduce the delivery time of the new controller.  KROK can do anything.  Sometimes even more.

      We on tests had a new piece of iron Dorado.  I didn‚Äôt have time to do it properly, but it seemed to be normal.  They explained, looked at each other - and let them drive just as long as the new controller was to sail.  During the day, they all migrated, but left the old system as a reserve. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The new controller still sailed even a little earlier than expected.  It's time to change back.  Reported that they are ready to carry out work on the replacement.  In response, we were told an amazing story about the fact that reports are now generated an order of magnitude faster, and he would consider this piece of iron for good.  And the old, as it were, is no longer necessary.  The client has standard database operations: the closing of the day, the report for the month, etc. These operations did not accelerate an order of magnitude, of course, but according to our measurements a little less than three times. <br><br>  We were generally not against giving the patient, but we wanted to finish the tests.  Therefore, when the controller arrived, they took it for two weeks to themselves, pulled the parts, mocked, re-evaluated and returned to the customer.  Users who had time to get used to the good, by this time finished finishing the admin body.  They counted everything.  It turns out pretty in the market.  In general, normal money, a competitive solution, but the client has already lowered the budget for this year.  We offered him an array in installments for three years.  Business approved, accounting approved, the question is already at the finish. <br><br>  Now why is Dorada cheaper than the market?  A cheaper array because Huawei makes half of the chips with his own working hands.  Street-price price is the same as for competitors, but there are more discounts - thanks to the vendor's own production, there is much to fall on. <br><br>  In the line of two arrays: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cy/tq/vt/cytqvt7nh6rhma1ocxydi0bq0so.jpeg"><br><br>  Active \ Active dual-controller arrays (disk shelves are connected via SAS3.0).  If desired, there can be even more controllers (at the moment - up to six, and after NG they promise as many as eight). <br><br>  FlashLink provides up to 4 million IOPS with a stable delay of no more than 500 ¬µs.  The HyperMetro functionality provides a stretched logical drive operating in the Active-Active mode, ensuring data availability at the 99.9999% level with a 1 ms delay. <br>  The disk developers on this project (both hardware and firmware) worked in conjunction with the storage developers.  As a result, the firmware was optimized for hardware and for the logic of work - the effect is visible not only in performance: everything began to work with less influence on the productive element, but also in additional functionality, such as replication and instant snapshots. <br><br>  Fault tolerance also became higher.  Departure of three disks allows you to continue working without interrupting the service. <br><br><h2>  Slides </h2><br>  Scale: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/99/6z/u5/996zu58bpa6spwb_wxodg3p4ndu.jpeg"><br>  <i>OceanStor Dorado5000 V3</i> <br><br>  Filling: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rh/ca/7z/rhca7zzhzbeuvxjld3kfb7la2wu.jpeg"><br>  <i>Array controller</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2a/tw/ru/2atwrubyjpedfq5bmyri2wafvjw.jpeg"><br>  <i>NVME disk</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zr/xv/oz/zrxvozr4fkxel1h9tzxxp44x2hu.jpeg"><br>  <i>Power supply and UPS (battery)</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1y/pc/vc/1ypcvc6cbzwopqqojdlbu0i70oe.png"><br>  <i>OceanStor Dorado6000 V3</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/co/bl/hvcobluvoeee990gctracnx273g.png"><br>  <i>OceanStor Dorado6000 V3 Disk Enclosure</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jg/zl/yq/jgzlyqezaxlnfnxst-p9xyxpq-g.png"><br>  <i>OceanStor Dorado5000 V3</i> <br><br><h3>  Extended array functionality </h3><br>  1.

Active \ Active Metro-cluster (replacement of synchronous replication) <br>  6. Replication (asynchronous).  OceanStor BCManager software integrates with the butt and allows you to do asynchronous replication in application-consistent mode. <br><br><h3>  Tests </h3><br>  Testing was performed on the OceanStor Dorado5000 V3 storage system with 25 SSD drives.  Two moons of 2 TB in size from the array were given to the virtual machine on the ESX host.  Before the tests, the moon was filled with 100% random data. <br><br>  According to the test results, the array showed excellent performance for all types of access. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r0/me/i9/r0mei958kxwjt2nv-k-0cksw4sw.png"><br><br>  Results: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ excellent performance; <br>  ‚Ä¢ nice and responsive interface; <br>  ‚Ä¢ there is almost all the necessary functionality (except for synchronous replication), there is a metro cluster, compression and deduplication; <br>  ‚Ä¢ installation in 5 minutes. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.croc.ru/solution/business-solutions/smartstorage/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Ddvs_smartstorage">DSS</a> is suitable for solving 99% of tasks requiring Full FLASH DSS.  On tests and in battle, she showed herself perfectly.  And even Huawei can be carried out as <a href="https://www.croc.ru/solution/services/independence/">import substitution</a> , which is another good plus. <br><br>  The piece of iron is great for heavily loaded applications.  The main focus of its creation was placed on high performance, reliability and low response time. <br><br>  By the way, we have another such piece of hardware in our demo fund.  We are happy to provide an opportunity to test everyone. <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IhclB0B87Y0">Here's</a> another video. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/350152/">https://habr.com/ru/post/350152/</a></p>
