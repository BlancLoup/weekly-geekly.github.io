Insurance case of the return of stolen money</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c7744d8c/7129efe0/513f312d/2bbccb76.jpg"><h5>  Intro </h5><br>  This story began in the month of June, when one morning, I received SMS messages about writing off $ 30 from a card on my phone.  This morning began on Saturday, when, after a hard working Friday, I did not immediately understand what was happening.  The second SMS came after 15 minutes, after reviewing it, I again saw the debiting of $ 30.  Immediately, my brain began to wake up and I began to realize that my money was leaving the card somewhere, there was a certain site that I saw for the first time in a text message.  From the domain name it was clear that this is some kind of billing. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The first thing I decided to call the bank to find out what was happening with my card.  After providing all the data, the operator immediately informed that fraudulent actions were taking place on your card at the moment and you need to block it urgently, but before that I have to withdraw all the money from the ATM, which was more than $ 1,000.  After the words "fraud", I immediately began to dress and went to the nearest ATM.  While I was driving, another sms came to me, for a total of $ 90 was written off.  Upon arrival, I immediately removed the cash and started calling the bank operator.  The card has been successfully blocked.  My questions on how I can get my money back were instructed.  Come to the nearest branch of the bank and write an application to challenge the transaction.  After the conversation with the operator was completed, another new message was burning on the display, while I was talking again $ 30 was written off.  And after 5 minutes another SMS came, an attempt to write off another $ 30 was rejected by the bank.  Total was already 120 dollars, and this is almost 3,500 rubles. <br><br><h5>  Following the instructions </h5><br>  I followed the instructions of the bank operator.  He came to the nearest office, took a printout of transactions, wrote an application to challenge transactions.  The girl immediately warned that today is Saturday, the department dealing with your application will only work from Monday.  She also added that usually these issues are resolved in the company Visa itself and if it is proved that these were fraudulent actions, then you will be refunded in 60 calendar days.  If it is decided that you yourself spent them, the refusal will come within a month.  I still did not have any options, but it was interesting what eventually will come out. <br>  The first month was in waiting, but to my happiness no one called.  I was glad that apparently my question would still be resolved in my favor.  Over time, I just forgot about it, was loaded with work affairs.  A few days ago I receive a text message in which it is written about crediting funds to a blocked card.  The next day I go to the Internet bank, I see in the account the amount of 1231 rubles.  I understand that this is not the amount and at the same time nobody called me again.  I start to call myself, the next bureaucracy, dozens of redirects, each explain a new situation.  An hour later, I finally get out on the right person, who says that your question is resolved in July, the money is transferred to your account and you need to get a new card to which funds will be transferred with the card blocked.  Trying to figure out why the amount of 1231, when it was stolen 3,500 rubles. <br>  And here is the result of the whole undertaking: The insurance company does not reimburse the client‚Äôs 100% loss! <br>  I understand that this issue cannot be resolved in Russia, I say thanks to the girl for the information and hang up.

    <h5>  Reflections </h5><br>  Itself at this time I scroll through the picture in my head.  For the last 2 months, I have entered into an agreement with RURU to work with him as a payment aggregator.  They took 70mb of scanned documents from me, that's all.  Charters, Inn, Ogrn and a bunch of company documents.  That is, in order to receive the services of an acquiring bank, I must almost give them my soul.  Why, then, billing writing off my money, so easily continues to work on.  American business?  Banking system kickbacks? <br>  I am very glad that they didn‚Äôt steal $ 1,000 from me, otherwise I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôd refund 100-150 bucks from them and everyone would come out clean. <br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  The moral of the story is this: do not keep money on the cards, do not pay them on the Internet, for this there are special virtual cards!  There is no law and justice not only in Russia, but also in other countries.  Unfortunately the result is sad. <br><br>  PS: I am not in the right to say anything and blame someone, but having been in this situation, I got exactly this impression.  And I am really glad that I responded in time and the amount of my losses did not become too large. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126715/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126715/</a></p>
