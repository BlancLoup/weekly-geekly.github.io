  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How we searched (and did not find) new tools for communication with customers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am in charge of the GLASHA Linguistic Online School.  And more recently, our company most often used e-mail and Skype for communication.  But the culture of communication is evolving.  Numerous unsuccessful updates of Skype turned many users away from this program.  Many of our students massively demolish this program from their gadgets.  In addition, people refuse e-mail, replacing it with FB and VC messengers.  Non-urgent phone calls are now considered a violation of etiquette, an invasion of personal space, and simply a move.  Companies have to adapt to these changes in communication. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  And although most of the communication takes place in social networks, WhatsApp is the favorite of the customer-oriented service.  This is the perfect tool for communication.  Some lessons in our Skype school are held with the help of this service.  Teachers can send students files, games, photos, videos - make the lessons interactive and fun, which is especially important for children. <br><br>  Most students and their parents install this particular messenger on the phone.  It allows you to promptly report on the cancellation or transfer of the lesson.  We can call teachers anywhere in the world for free.

      But whatsapp can not use several different people from the same number.  For example, in a corporate Skype, around-the-clock, we have operators on a common account on duty, imperceptibly replacing each other.  So we quickly review the history of messages and monitor lessons.  If the student and the teacher have a green light, then as a rule, this means that both are online and the lesson is regular. <br><br>  After numerous global crashes of Skype, almost all teachers switched to Zoom.  The quality of communication in this service is much higher, and the functions for teaching are much more.  For example, the ability to preload files is built in, and thus, time is saved to open them during the lesson, you can correct errors with the teacher.  In a word, both for conducting lessons and for their coordination, Skype, unfortunately, is hopelessly outdated. <br><br>  We tried to do a group in WhatsApp with a student and three operators, but this turned out to be extremely inconvenient.  WhatsApp Business is not very clear, as it allows, as we think at GLASHA, only to write the name of the company, but it does not allow people from different phones to log in to the same account. <br><br>  Our second important channel for communication is social networks: Facebook, Instagram, VK and LinkedIn.  With the help of these messengers, we not only recruit new teachers, but also conclude contracts. <br><br>  The best strategy for a company with customers around the world is to combine all channels of communication.  Therefore, our operators at the same time open all possible contacts of students and teachers, starting from their Facebook profile, ending with completely forgotten ICQ in case of force majeure. <br><br>  This allows you to always "keep abreast of the pulse" and instantly respond to any requests from students and teachers, but an ideal program would be to unite these channels.  I try to monitor new developments in this area, but so far I do not see anything appropriate, although the need for such a system has long been overdue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446502/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446502/</a></p>
