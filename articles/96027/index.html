  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apple iPhone 4 Comparison - Google Nexus One</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Apple has finally introduced a new model of iPhone 4, in its characteristics far superior to the iPhone 3Gs. <br>  And it‚Äôs clear that the new Apple iPhone 4 is the clear answer to the most important competitor - the Google Nexus One.  Because  The previous model, Apple iPhone 3Gs, in many respects began to yield to Google Nexus One - see this topic for: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/iphone/95654/">‚ÄúiPhone 3GS vs.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/iphone/95654/">Nexus One</a> . <br>  If we compare the purely technical (digital) characteristics, we find that the Apple iPhone 4 diligently does not want to give way to the Google Nexus One, and by some parameters even began to exceed the latter. <br><br>  Let's start, let's just compare the main characteristics. <br>  Characteristics taken from official sites: <br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html">www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/phone/static/en_US-nexusone_tech_specs.html">www.google.com/phone/static/en_US-nexusone_tech_specs.html</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  [In brackets will be given the distinctive characteristics that have a very close analogue of Google Nexus One - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/89440/">HTC Desire</a> model, taken from the Russian HTC site: <a href="http://www.htc.com/ru/product/desire/specification.html">www.htc.com/ru/product/desire/specification.html</a> ] <br><br>  <b>Apple iPhone 4</b> - <b>Google Nexus One</b> <br>  <b>1.

And often an indication of a large number of megapixels - is just an advertising campaign for the sellers of photographic equipment in the fight against competitors! <br><br>  Steve Jobs himself said at the presentation that the human eye does not distinguish more than 300 ppi per inch, and the display of the iPhone 4 - displays as much as 356 ppi - why so much, maybe for aliens !? <br>  At the same time, 300 dpi is the limit of the most ideal human vision, and which of us has perfect vision today ... <br>  The display of the iPhone 4 - gives obviously much more points than a person with the most perfect vision can see. <br>  And, respectively, buying the iPhone 4, the buyer simply overpays for these extra and unnecessary more than 300 ppi, which he can never see. <br><br>  But the Google Nexus One display - just gives out a little less than 300 ppi (more precisely 256 dpi - only 44 dots are not enough to reach an ideal 300 ppi) - i.e.  just as much as you can actually see :) <br><br>  If we compare the contrast of displays, then it is obvious that technically (in numbers) loses Apple iPhone 4 with <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2596%25D0%259A-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">IPS-LCD</a> (Retina Display) = 800: 1 vs. <b>100,000: 1</b> = <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active-Matrix_OLED"><b>AMOLED</b></a> (Active-Matrix <a href="http://mob.ua/terms/tehnologii_i_standarty/oled.html">OLED</a> ) of Google Nexus One. <br>  ‚ÄúOf course, many may begin to argue about these figures, based on the difference in measurement techniques, because it really seems unrealistic that the IPS-LCD contrast is 125 times less than the contrast of the AMOLED display, but still these figures are shown on official websites - where not taken to deceive. <br>  Today, AMOLED-technology has some drawbacks, but there are obvious significant advantages - see the article: <a href="http://criticus.ru/%3Fp%3D333">"AMOLED- and TFT-displays - a comparative review</a> . <a href="http://criticus.ru/%3Fp%3D333">"</a> <br><br>  Why Apple has not used the AMOLED display in the new iPhone 4, presumably there are several reasons: <br>  1. Korean Samsung, and Taiwanese companies TPO Display and Optronics are currently the only manufacturers of AMOLED displays, and they cannot handle existing orders even for less popular models from other manufacturers, and Apple is not interested in creating an excessive shortage of devices. <br>  2. The cost of AMOLED display is almost two times higher than that of classic SMD (LED displays), which are used in iPhone 3Gs. <br>  3. In addition - studies have shown that the classic type of SMD display is more suitable for reading.  And this is also an important position for Apple, since it is actively promoting the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmobile reading. <br>  These reasons are found in the following articles (and comments to this topic): <br>  <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/fullnews/main/2010/May/27.shtml">"Fourth-generation iPhone models can differ not only in memory?"</a> <br>  <a href="http://criticus.ru/%3Fp%3D333">‚ÄúAMOLED and TFT Displays ‚Äî A Comparative Review‚Äù</a> <br><br>  Of course, I understand that a lot depends on the subjective feelings of Apple iPhone 4 users. And one such user has already expressed his opinion: <br>  ‚ÄúHaving turned my hands on a new iPhone, I almost stopped doubting that my Nexus One was no longer the last word of technology‚Äù - see: <a href="http://deepapple.com/news/37485.html">‚ÄúQuote of the day.</a>  <a href="http://deepapple.com/news/37485.html">Issue 82</a> . <br>  But I think that it is not enough just to turn it in my hands, but it is probably worth making judgments at least after several weeks of using the gadget :) <br><br>  What do you think of it? <br><br>  PS: The purpose of the topic is not holivar, but simply an attempt to show that competition between companies leads to the release of great products (to the delight of consumers).  And if it were not for Google Nexus One, then it would have been unknown if Apple iPhone 4 was such a wonderful :) <br>  This article compares only the technical (digital ‚Äî that is, the objective and available on the manufacturers' websites) characteristics of smartphones and their software component is not compared, since  I cannot objectively compare OS and software (Apple iPhone 4 has not yet gone on sale and few people have it in hand, and I don‚Äôt really want to compare software). <br><br>  PPS: What kind of Russian Habra people are holivarny, why not just discuss the topic, why do you need to look for the enemy and kill any dissident :( </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96027/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96027/</a></p>
