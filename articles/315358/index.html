Nikiforov stressed that the law has already entered into force, and its observance will be ‚Äúmore and more often checked, regardless of what kind of company it is.  It can be both Russian and foreign companies. ‚Äù <br><br>  Roskomnadzor <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/282492/">demanded</a> to limit access to the business social network LinkedIn due to the fact that the portal violates the law on personal data.  The ministry explained its initiative by the fact that the social network has not yet transferred its servers to Russia, and also allows for the leakage of user data. <br><br>  One of the main arguments of the plaintiff was ‚Äústoring and collecting data of unregistered users‚Äù.  According to Roskomnadzor experts, LinkedIn social network collects such data, namely, information about ip-addresses, browser and cookies.  According to the newspaper, in early August, the Tagansky court granted Roskomnadzor's request to block LinkedIn.  Representatives of the social network challenged the decision in the Moscow City Court.  The Appeals Board in civil cases of the Moscow City Court left the decision of the Tagansky District Court of August 4 of this year unchanged.

      But so far, despite the seriousness of the situation, access to LinkedIn on the territory of the Russian Federation is still not limited. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚ÄúWe will add LinkedIn to the register of violators of the rights of personal data subjects.  This means that the site in Russia will be blocked, ‚Äù <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/10/11/2016/58247db29a794720818ab902">said</a> Vadim Ampelonsky, a representative of Roskomnadzor.  He clarified that this will happen as soon as the service receives a court decision: "It usually takes a week to do it." <br><br>  On September 1, 2015, Federal Law No. 242- came into force, which requires companies to provide basic types of processing of personal data of Russian citizens using servers located in the territory of the Russian Federation.  Sites that violated the law, on the basis of the relevant decision of the court Roskomnadzor will make a special register, and in case of failure to comply with the instructions, the sites will be blocked. <br><br>  After the entry into force of the amendments on the storage of personal data, Roskomnadzor demanded to transfer information about users to Russian servers and from other large social networks - Twitter, Facebook. <br><br>  But going to court against LinkedIn was primarily due to the multiple leakage of user data from this platform.  The largest of them <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-hacked-167-million-accounts-sale-dark-web-chris-haines">occurred</a> in May of this year, when information about 167 million users appeared on the Web.  Data on 117 million of them, including the required for logging into the account, were sold on the Internet for 5 Bitcoins (approximately $ 3.65 thousand), for the remaining 50 million only e-mail addresses for access to accounts were sold. <br><br>  What will happen after LinkedIn stops working in Russia?  How will this affect the business of HR companies?  What alternatives to finding IT professionals will remain in their arsenal?  Or LinkedIn was not so popular in our country to talk about any significant consequences? <br><br>  We asked the players of the Russian recruitment market to express their opinions. <br><br><h4>  Nadezhda Styazhkina, Manager of Antal Russia Recruiting Company: </h4><br>  <b>1. Did your company use LinkedIn to hire or search for potential employees?</b>  <b>How many employees were hired by the service?</b>  <b>Did your company have a ‚Äúbusiness page‚Äù within this social network?</b> <br><br>  As a recruiter, I can say that LinkedIn is popular, especially if we are talking about finding middle and top management.  We actively use this tool for networking, maintaining professional contacts and searching for new candidates for client positions.  Our company also has a page on LinkedIn, and we also attract colleagues to teams, including through this tool. <br><br>  <b>2. After blocking in the Russian Federation - what alternatives do you consider for finding new employees (especially in IT)?</b>  <b>How actively do you plan to participate in communities, and not just post vacancies on sites without a social component?</b> <br><br>  Although according to LinkedIn in the Russian segment of registered users, 35% are working in the IT field, this is not the only personnel search tool in this area.  Other social networks, professional forums, boolean search, and handhunting will continue to be used. <br><br>  <b>3. Will you continue to use the service using a proxy / VPN (for lack of alternatives), or will you fully switch to other resources to find employees?</b>  <b>Foreign or domestic resources for you in priority?</b> <br><br>  Bypassing a lock is relatively simple; those who work in the IT field know this; therefore, if you are looking for IT specialists, you need to keep in mind that they will not leave LinkedIn at all. <br><br>  <b>4. What is your general attitude towards blocking professional (and not entertainment) resources?</b>  <b>Do you think LinkedIn locks are worth it?</b> <br><br>  LinkedIn lockout will make life more difficult for the professional community.  However, the fact that the management of the social network allowed this situation, partly confirms that for LinkedIn Russia was not the most priority market: because of the economic situation and because the monetization methods that this service uses (premium accounts, paid vacancies, etc.) , in our country were less in demand than abroad. <br><br>  <b>5. What consequences for HR / recruiting in Russia do you see after blocking the world's largest resource on this subject?</b> <br><br>  In Russia, LinkedIn was still not as popular as abroad, and 5, and even more so 10 years ago, the Russian user base was extremely small, and there was practically no such tool for recruiters in our country.  However, there were other methods that still work effectively: building personal professional contacts, headhunting, etc.  For experienced recruiters, blocking LinkedIn will weaken the competition and give odds to strong recruiters with experience that have many more tools in their arsenal, and not just access to professional social networks and work sites. <br><br>  At the same time, recruitment will become more difficult and costly for internal HR services.  Since now in the arsenal of HR specialist will be one tool less.  LinkedIn competitors in the face of work sites and other professional social networks will also benefit from blocking.  They will reach a new audience. <br><br>  According to our annual labor market research *, only about 2‚Äì3% of applicants find work through social networks.  However, about 18% of candidates say that they have found a job through professional contacts, and LinkedIn helps them to find and establish, including largely.  Also, about 17% of employees say that they changed jobs after an employer directly addressed them, who could also contact a person through a professional social network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29f/e63/c7f/29fe63c7fe70424198cb959db92eceb5.png"><br><br>  In addition, according to our data **, most employers use social networks as an additional source of information about the candidate and check the pages of applicants on social networks before inviting them to work.  According to the results of our survey, 74% of companies, at least sometimes, view profiles of candidates in social networks before making a final decision on hiring a person.  Of these, 11% of particular attention is paid to the business profile of a potential employee on LinkedIn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/735/2c0/c1f/7352c0c1f8a242caa9da8c4d3c604b6f.png"><br><br>  * The study was conducted from April 6 to April 29, 2016 through an online survey, which was attended by 5,574 employees of Russian and international companies from different regions of Russia. <br><br>  ** The survey was conducted from February 15 to February 27, 2016 through an online survey, in which 207 Russian and international companies operating in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kazan and other regions from various sectors of the economy took part. <br><br><h4>  Zulia Loikova, independent HR: </h4><br>  <b>1. Did your company use LinkedIn to hire or search for potential employees?</b>  <b>How many employees were hired by the service?</b>  <b>Did your company have a ‚Äúbusiness page‚Äù within this social network?</b> <br><br>  Yes, quite actively, about 30% of the total closed vacancies mostly looked for and found good sales, developers, marketers, financiers, HR and highly specialized experts in a particular area, and the resource also helped us to repeatedly find cool professionals in the European and American markets. . <br><br>  The service page is an indispensable part on LinkedIn, which makes it possible to effectively touch interesting candidates and acquaint them with the specifics of the activity. <br><br>  <b>2. After blocking in the Russian Federation - what alternatives do you consider for finding new employees (especially in IT)?</b>  <b>How actively do you plan to participate in communities, and not just post vacancies on sites without a social component?</b> <br><br>  After blocking, I consider the possibility of searching through add.  functions FB, VK, if we talk about vacancies in IT, as before - My Circle, Amazing hiring, work sites, github, spec.  forums.  community and stuff. <br><br>  <b>3. Will you continue to use the service using a proxy / VPN (for lack of alternatives)?</b> <br>  I think that yes, as well as the ban Rutracker.org gave the opportunity to learn users to go to a resource in the bypass. <br><br>  <b>or completely go to other resources to find employees?</b> <br><br>  Partially. <br><br>  <b>Foreign or domestic resources for you in priority?</b> <br><br>  Both those, and others, primarily focus on the incoming flow of candidates from the resource and ease of use. <br><br>  <b>4. What is your general attitude towards blocking professional (and not entertainment) resources?</b>  <b>Do you think LinkedIn locks are worth it?</b> <br><br>  Any ban attracts more popularity and attention to the resource; LinkedIn is a really useful resource; it has been used in its work for more than 9 years; many of my colleagues are now experiencing this news, working through the add.  options for finding staff. <br><br>  <b>5. What consequences for HR / recruiting in Russia do you see after blocking the world's largest resource on this subject?</b> <br><br>  On the one hand, all that is connected with the prohibition of one resource will enable the development of other additional resources and search sites.  I think that the headhunting market will have more opportunities to make money in this case. <br><br><h4>  Nadezhda Nedorezova, Rambler &amp; Co selection team leader: </h4><br>  <b>1. Did your company use LinkedIn to hire or search for potential employees?</b>  <b>How many employees were hired by the service?</b>  <b>Did your company have a ‚Äúbusiness page‚Äù within this social network?</b> <br><br>  In LinkedIn, Rambler &amp; Co has a corporate profile for publishing company news, information about running projects, people who manage divisions of a group of companies, as well as vacancies.  A small number of staff we really hired thanks to this resource. <br><br>  <b>2. After blocking in the Russian Federation - what alternatives do you consider for finding new employees (especially in IT)?</b>  <b>How actively do you plan to participate in communities, and not just post vacancies on sites without a social component?</b> <br><br>  Regardless of LinkedIn, we use various specialized communities to post vacancies and search for the necessary specialists, especially as regards IT selection, and we will increase our activity in them. <br><br>  <b>3. Will you continue to use the service using a proxy / VPN (for lack of alternatives), or will you completely switch to other resources to find employees?</b>  <b>Foreign or domestic resources for you in priority?</b> <br><br>  We also see the opportunity to work with remote consultants who can carry out the necessary resource searches for us in other countries.  But initially the benefit of the network itself was precisely that the candidates themselves used it to look for work.  Now it is expected to decrease this efficiency at times. <br><br>  <b>4. What is your general attitude towards blocking professional (and not entertainment) resources?</b>  <b>Do you think LinkedIn locks are worth it?</b> <br><br>  Like everyone else, blocking LinkedIn gives us inconvenience, but the law is one for all - we honor and respect it. <br><br>  <b>5. What consequences for HR / recruiting in Russia do you see after blocking the world's largest resource on this subject?</b> <br><br>  We believe that professional communities will increase their growth rates and it will be possible to find many alternative solutions in effective communication with candidates, both potential and those who are already actively considering job offers. <br><br><h4>  Julia Salandaeva, HR Director, Netrika: </h4><br>  <b>1. Did your company use LinkedIn to hire or search for potential employees?</b>  <b>How many employees were hired by the service?</b>  <b>Did your company have a ‚Äúbusiness page‚Äù within this social network?</b> <br><br>  Many IT professionals have LinkedIn accounts, and we are actively using the capabilities of this professional network.  The resource has a very high-quality audience - approximately 50% of the relevant resumes are on LinkedIn.  Now, some of the candidates selected there for a month pass our testing and interviewing stages. <br><br>  <b>2. After blocking in the Russian Federation - what alternatives do you consider for finding new employees (especially in IT)?</b>  <b>How actively do you plan to participate in communities, and not just post vacancies on sites without a social component?</b> <br><br>  The resource ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù shows itself quite well, which has completely reoriented itself to IT specialties.  From the point of view of the interface, it is even friendlier in places than LinkedIn.  In addition, we will be more active to conduct a point search in specialized communities and other social networks: for example, on Habrahabr and Google+. <br><br>  <b>3. Will you continue to use the service using a proxy / VPN (for lack of alternatives), or will you completely switch to other resources to find employees?</b>  <b>Foreign or domestic resources for you in priority?</b> <br><br>  For our company, there is no such option: since we work in the segment of informatization of the public sector, all the processes and software that we use are as legal and transparent as possible. <br><br>  Therefore, blocking LinkedIn will, of course, make it difficult to find employees and reduce our capabilities.  For the successful and early selection of appropriate personnel, it is important in our work to use different channels.  As far as I know, Facebook plans on its resource to implement tools for candidates and employers - we hope that one of the resources will close the resulting niche. <br><br>  <b>4. What is your general attitude towards blocking professional (and not entertainment) resources?</b>  <b>Do you think LinkedIn locks are worth it?</b> <br><br>  The question is not so much whether the resource locks or not.  To comply with federal laws is required for each site, regardless of its focus.  On the other hand, the provision of personal data is the personal right of every person.  If he does not want to write something about himself, he will not do it.  Such a decision in a coercive manner, will cause for many users only bewilderment and the development of alternative channels of access to this resource.  Therefore, the development of the situation that is ideal for all is to find ways to implement the legislation through negotiations. <br><br>  <b>5. What consequences for HR / recruiting in Russia do you see after blocking the world's largest resource on this subject?</b> <br><br>  The lack of such a resource will affect both employers and applicants.  After all, LinkedIn is not only a field of activity for recruiters, but also a tool for developing the labor market.  Candidates could successfully get real-life feedback from people in a particular company, find better conditions and develop a network of professional contacts.  Other social networks are not intended for this.  We still hope that the management of LinkedIn will be able to find a way to enforce the law, and the resource will resume its work for Russian users. <br><br><h4>  Vladimir Vinogradov, President of the Pro-Vision group of companies: </h4><br>  <b>1. Did your company use LinkedIn to hire or search for potential employees?</b>  <b>How many employees were hired by the service?</b>  <b>Did your company have a ‚Äúbusiness page‚Äù within this social network?</b> <br><br>  In Pro-Vision, we used LinkedIn to search for middle-level employees (middle managers) and top managers.  Since this is not just an HR resource, but a social network for professionals, it allows not only viewing resumes, but also communicating directly with candidates.  And this is a good opportunity to make an effective acquaintance: even if a particular candidate does not resemble our vacancy, the right person can often be found on his recommendations or through his ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. <br><br>  Of course, LinkedIn is a convenient and, importantly, free platform, unlike some others.  Nevertheless, for us this is only one of the channels for searching for candidates, and it cannot be said that we found someone from the workers only thanks to this network.  We did not lead your page. <br><br>  <b>2. After blocking in the Russian Federation - what alternatives do you consider for finding new employees (especially in IT)?</b>  <b>How actively do you plan to participate in communities, and not just post vacancies on sites without a social component?</b> <br><br>  Without LinkedIn, recruiting in Pro-Vision won't die for sure.  After blocking the site in Russia, we will continue to use those resources that were accessed earlier: HR portals, specialized communities in social networks, specialized chat rooms, etc. As regards active participation in these public sites, we constantly monitor professional communities and, if necessary, can connect to chat. <br><br>  <b>3. Will you continue to use the service using a proxy / VPN (for lack of alternatives), or will you completely switch to other resources to find employees?</b>  <b>Foreign or domestic resources for you in priority?</b> <br><br>  We work only in Russia and are focused on the search for Russian specialists.  If the network is blocked for them, why go there "bypass"?  Yes, the portal is convenient, but there are other channels to search for employees. <br><br>  <b>4. What is your general attitude towards blocking professional (and not entertainment) resources?</b>  <b>In your opinion, does LinkedIn lock deserve?</b> <br><br>  I am not a supporter of locks, especially since this, as a rule, does not solve the original problem - the workarounds are known everywhere.  The question here is not whether LinkedIn deserves blocking or not, it‚Äôs not ethics, but the legal norms adopted by our legislation.  If the network itself is important Russian market, then soon it will resolve the situation itself. <br><br>  <b>5. What consequences for HR / recruiting in Russia do you see after blocking the world's largest resource on this subject?</b> <br><br>  For companies that are interested in finding foreign specialists, this will complicate the process.  Restricting access can be a problem for new applicants who are focused on the international market, but do not have an account on this network.  The rest will continue to use other sites. <br><br><h4>  <b>Other experts believe that after blocking in general, nothing will change.</b> </h4><br><h4>  Natalya Rushkevich, Director of HR and Corporate Communications at the IT company LiveTex: </h4><br>  <b>1. Did your company use LinkedIn to hire or search for potential employees?</b>  <b>How many employees were hired by the service?</b>  <b>Did your company have a ‚Äúbusiness page‚Äù within this social network?</b> <br><br>  Of course, we always used LinkedIn as one of the recruiting tools.  We did not create the business page of the company and simply communicated with the candidates we were interested in.  LinkedIn is a really high-quality platform for finding top employees, as well as IT specialists.  Unlike well-known job search sites, LinkedIn is a sieve through which experts are sifted with sufficient quality.  You do not have to "wade" through the jungle of irrelevant and poor-quality resumes, such as, for example, on standard job search sites. <br><br>  <b>2. After blocking in the Russian Federation - what alternatives do you consider for finding new employees (especially in IT)?</b>  <b>How actively do you plan to participate in communities, and not just post vacancies on sites without a social component?</b> <br><br>  First of all, we will use our already established databases, including those that have been developed using LinkedIn.  I suppose that in many companies, recruiters are now frantically keeping contacts from LinkedIn, but you can‚Äôt download the whole site! <br><br>  I think that a considerable part of IT specialists will ‚Äúgo‚Äù to ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù and will more actively use ‚ÄúHabrahabr‚Äù for job search.  By the way, aren't Theme Media yet planning to ‚Äútake over the world‚Äù after the news of LinkedIn blocking?  ( <i>irony</i> ).  We will also continue to actively post vacancies on professional portals and groups, and take part in the life of the IT community, because you can never guess exactly where the employee of the dream can meet. <br><br>  <b>3. Will you continue to use the service using a proxy / VPN (for lack of alternatives), or will you completely switch to other resources to find employees?</b>  <b>Foreign or domestic resources for you in priority?</b> <br><br>  Since we work in the Russian market, our specialists are our priority, therefore we work in the ‚Äúdomestic‚Äù segment.  As part of the company's strategy, we do not assume the use of lock bypass.  But, of course, we will not be able to keep a very active recruiter from searching for an employee, including LinkedIn, from his home computer. <br><br>  <b>4. What is your general attitude towards blocking professional (and not entertainment) resources?</b>  <b>Do you think LinkedIn locks are worth it?</b> <br><br>  The problem of saving and processing personal data is rather far-fetched.  We all understand that as soon as a person leaves his mark on the Internet for the first time, his data are already available.  This is Forever, there is no other option, and no laws on oblivion will save!  Therefore, we do not support LinkedIn blocking.  This is only a drop in the sea, which does not solve the problem. <br><br>  <b>5. What consequences for HR / recruiting in Russia do you see after blocking the world's largest resource on this subject?</b> <br><br>  In Russia, I don‚Äôt expect global consequences after blocking LinkedIn.  You know, it is not without reason that in our fairy tales there is Ivan the Fool, who, thanks to his wit and ingenuity, comes out dry from various troubles.  I am sure that in our country, companies will come up with a way out of the current situation, get out, and the most proactive will create at least a quality service to search for top employees and IT-specialists, pump it and feel good. <br><br><h4>  Dmitry Larin, Head of the Business Direction, Personnel Recruitment and Interplace Computing: </h4><br>  <b>1. Did your company use LinkedIn to hire or search for potential employees?</b>  <b>How many employees were hired by the service?</b>  <b>Did your company have a ‚Äúbusiness page‚Äù within this social network?</b> <br><br>  LinkedIn used and will continue to use, there is a premium account.  The number of applicants found there is significant, because customers often expect it to be ‚Äúmined out of the ground‚Äù professionals, rather than a summary of shortcuts that have long been visible, or they themselves respond to a vacancy.  There is a page there, of course! <br><br>  <b>2. After blocking in the Russian Federation - what alternatives do you consider for finding new employees (especially in IT)?</b>  <b>How actively do you plan to participate in communities, and not just post vacancies on sites without a social component?</b> <br><br>  Let's remember that LinkedIn is a network for establishing business contacts and professional communication, and not just a party of recruiters.  It is also a marketing tool with a very ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù audience, industry and professional groups and other gadgets. <br><br>  There are a lot of alternative networks (Xing, Viadeo, Moy Krug is more suitable for finding IT people, Professionals.ru, narrow professional forums: kaggle.com, stackoverflow.com, etc., corresponding groups on Facebook.), But none even came close to LinkedIn in its convenience and functionality.  Even if Facebook launches its own job search application, the entire base of professional contacts will not move there by itself - and these are thousands of people and years of work to establish these links. <br><br>  We will continue and strengthen the participation and search for candidates in narrowly professional communities, but this is done for a specific specific project.  We do not always publish vacancies - from the cannon on the sparrows is not the fastest and most effective way. <br><br>  <b>3. Will you continue to use the service using a proxy / VPN (for lack of alternatives), or will you fully switch to other resources to find employees?</b>  <b>Foreign or domestic resources for you in priority?</b> <br><br>  Like most large companies, we strictly follow all the subtleties of the legislation and information security standards, so the options are now in coordination with IT and SC.  But without LinkedIn, we definitely will not stay - choose from what.  For applicants, however, everything is extremely simple - 1 minute of time to ‚Äúproxy‚Äù (for example, I liked the names snowdenway and hidemyass), and better than 5 minutes to install a VPN or TOR browser. <br><br>  We use both foreign and domestic resources - everything for the project, no one has also canceled a direct search. <br><br>  <b>4.

In our company there is no employee who came directly from this network. Candidates for positions in sales, marketing, products and projects happened, but not the developers. Profile sites, job search sites, social networks, and most importantly recommendations, have always given greater results for closing vacancies in development. Another thing is that you can ask for recommendations in the same LinkedIn. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Projects and products coming from LinkedIn, with great pleasure, recommend colleagues with whom they have ever successfully collaborated on projects. But Facebook in this matter for me is much faster and more convenient.</font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. After blocking in the Russian Federation - what alternatives do you consider for finding new employees (especially in IT)?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> I am always open to the consideration of new alternatives to search, but for me these searches for new channels are not related to the closure of this service. My experience says that people active in LinkedIn are often active in other professional communities and social networks, so my LinkedIn audience will remain with me. For me, the personal network of acquaintances always has more weight (here it is necessary to insert the fashionable word ‚Äúnetworking‚Äù), contacts of such a level of personal and professional trust, when you can get almost any information I need.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, the rule of ‚Äúsix handshakes‚Äù no longer works, it was transformed into the rule of ‚Äúthree‚Äù. The time between these handshakes has been reduced to a critical minimum, has become very ideological in nature, and the cooperation has become even warmer, longer and more productive. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Maintaining dry contacts faded into the background, and warm professional relationships lined up for many years! Recruiters and HRy help each other in finding the right contacts, including Western colleagues will always help in finding the right contact, even on LinkedIn. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3. Will you continue to use the service using a proxy (for lack of alternatives), or will you completely switch to other resources to find employees?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> I will leave everything as it is and watch the situation.</font></font><br><br> <b>4.

HR        ?</b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I know a lot of HR and recruiters, for whom LinkedIn was the main resource for finding and attracting employees, a platform for HR branding, professional communications, as well as communication with foreign colleagues. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Also, many candidates who did not want to ‚Äúshine‚Äù on job search sites were active on this resource. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We will take measures to strengthen other channels, we will not bet on a single resource, become more flexible and choose other search strategies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's roll over the head, stand in a steady position and go on working! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is Russia baby, we are no stranger! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, or I have completely deteriorated in 7 years in IT startups! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">( </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">irony</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ).</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Executive Director of the marketing agency "Biplan" Evgeny Karyuk: </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How many times have we not tried to ‚Äúmake friends‚Äù with LinkedIn, reacting to the growing popularity of the site and the positive feedback from colleagues in the shop, it all came down to the simple opinion of HR - ‚ÄúHeadHunter and Rjob are closer and more convenient for me‚Äù. You can‚Äôt argue with a specialist, especially considering the fact that she regularly offers potentially interesting candidates. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After a while, we thought about creating a ‚Äúbusiness page‚Äù, exclusively for expanding ways of communicating with specialists and promoting the brand in the market. Roskomnadzor postponed this idea for later. Perhaps we are just underestimating LinkedIn, although we are confident that the Russian medium-sized company will have enough Russian counterparts to solve their problems in finding new specialists.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Periodically, we use specialized communities to post vacancies and increase audience coverage. We resort to non-standard content delivery, adding a touch of creativity to the usual functionality. In the future we plan to increase the momentum and more often interact with the thematic communities. For example, we are now looking for an HR who knows how to manage all the new and old resources. Suddenly, ‚Äúthe same specialist‚Äù will read this comment.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We believe, like most adequate employers, that blocking is useless, senseless and merciless. We can discuss the secrecy of data storage of our fellow citizens for a long time and look for workarounds that are fairly easy to find on the Internet, even if you have not previously encountered a similar situation. As a leader, it is important for me to have a choice, to see the prospects and advantages of each individual candidate. Many of them duplicate their resumes at several sites, but this does not interfere with our monitoring.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Representatives of large companies and corporations will be extremely difficult without the world's largest resource. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They are focused on finding top managers and area managers with their entire background and portfolio. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For them, a personal conversation or meeting is not enough, the path to success, the desire and desire with which you climbed the career ladder is important to them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each employer is waiting for you ready-made solutions and interesting ideas, just someone has time to wait, while others do not. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I don‚Äôt see a catastrophe in the transition to other resources, in the end you can take advantage of the new development prospects of Facebook, before Roskomnadzor has reached it.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Yulia Epifantseva, Business Development Director, PROMT: </font></font></h4><br>     LinkedIn   ,  ,  ,    :     HH,       Rusbase. <br><br>    b2b   ‚Äì   PROMT     ,          .   ,    ,   e-mail, . <br><br>      LinkedIn.   ,      ,    ¬´¬ª 4  . <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But you need to understand that LinkedIn is not a traditional social network like Facebook or VKontakte, it has certain tasks - the interaction between each other professionals in various fields, business communication, recruiting, and so on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is one of the world's largest professional communities, and I would not want Russia to fall out of it.</font></font><br><br><h4>  <b>What to do?</b> </h4><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Dmitry Chekin, founder of CSSSR: </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To be honest, blocking Pornhub is a big </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">irony</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> tragedy </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Elizaveta Yanovskaya, Executive Director, CSSSR: </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">LinkedIn for us personally has always been more a tool for sales and finding the right connections, not HR. It is much easier to find the ‚Äúdecision maker‚Äù you need than the developer. It is especially convenient to look there and meet foreigners - again, with managers, managers, directors. Personally, I keep my LinkedIn exclusively for connections, most often outside of Russia and the CIS. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Once we decided to try LinkedIn to search for candidates. A paid account was very expensive, and free functionality made us suffer. The results did not impress: of all the candidates to whom we wrote, only three reached the initial interview, but none of them reached the test task. The conversion is sad, especially for manual search.</font></font><br><br>  ,   LinkedIn   .      ‚Äî hh.ru, moikrug.ru   .        . ,    ,      -        .  , ,   . <br><br><h4>  ,        Cornerstone: </h4><br>    LinkedIn   , , ,  HR-.    : <br><br>    LinkedIn ‚Äî     , ,    , , ,    . <br><br>  ,        ,  ,     . <br><br>              . <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For internal recruiters (HR managers), working with the service allowed you to save money on external recruitment, as well as on database management platforms. Paid accounts allowed to do everything within the system: to spot candidates, to correspond with them, to draw up a resume, to sort, to leave the necessary comments. In addition, the corporate page on LinkedIn worked perfectly for the company's HR brand, it was possible to publish vacancies, communicate with applicants and shape the image of a modern efficient employer, win loyalty to the target audience, stand out among competitors, attract the best to yourself.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, as always happens, for a Russian person any ban is a chance to figure out how to get around it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it will be possible to use LinkedIn with the help of special programs and sites configured to connect the user not through Russian IP, they are already being tested and working. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the activity of Russian users will still fall, and this can not help but sadness.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Founder of the online ecosystem of design projects and repairs of PricerRemont, Rewedo and Rerooms Yuri Goldberg: </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our development director "marked" post on the topic. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Commentators sadly supported the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbypassing the lock. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">LinkedIn has long been turned into a direct sales platform, spamming with sales offers spilling constantly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I don‚Äôt use LinkedIn, HH.ru too much for solving the problems of hiring staff.</font></font><br><br>  What to do? <br><br> 1.  . <br><br> 2.   ,   : -&gt; My network -&gt; Connections -&gt; Settings -&gt; Advanced Settings -&gt; Export LinkedIn Connections.        2 .   . <br><br> 3.
