And here it comes out, what are we going to do with it. <br>  Starting conditions, a cohesive team of the department into which it merges, a couple of dozen working projects, five manager managers, with their Wishlist, anticipating in advance more completed tasks.  And the new man, who so far can not be charged with virtually nothing. <br>  Well and you, the head who is responsible for everything made by the zryaplata. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The following text is purely personal experience and a description of my actions. <br>  First, a little about motivation, why I will teach a person, to gain knowledge, and just what I want to get. <br>  And I want to get an employee who, with high quality and in a clearly defined time frame, will do what he was assigned.  He will not whine, he will forget the words ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know this‚Äù, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how‚Äù, ‚Äúwhy me?‚Äù, ‚ÄúOr maybe it‚Äôs better to do it ...‚Äù.  Forget whether he can do it or not (to doubt for him is my work).  Always be ready to help a colleague.  That's so slightly cynical.  But, my salary will depend on his work.  (but by the way, it does not depend on it :)) <br><br>  From the above it becomes clear that the development of technical skills alone is not enough.

      The man came.  The first day is quite ordinary, we will spend on the company, we will show everything, imagine everything.  Managers will once again ask when it will be possible to add tasks :).  Well, then let him read a little, get acquainted with the development system, internal programs and systems.  I will not ask what he understood.  Approximately imagining what kind of knowledge is needed for the first task, I will give links to the docks, I will clearly say what needs to be clarified and ask some questions later. <br><br>  Everything, the entry is over, and now work.  The only difference from the current employee is ‚Äúno deadlines‚Äù from above. <br>  For each task I ask - ‚Äúwhen will you do it?‚Äù Not ‚Äúfor how much will you do?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWill there be enough N days?‚Äù.  When!  The answer to this question is the date and time.  After the answer ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know‚Äù, ‚Äúprobably then‚Äù, this answer will be in 100% of cases - I will tell you why they do not mean anything, do not interest anyone, and why a person needs a clear answer and what he will give to him personally. <br><br>  All tasks from the outset for combat projects.  All that will be done, everything will work.  No theoretical and educational tasks. <br>  To pick up such tasks is sometimes incredibly difficult.  Even harder to build the necessary chain of them.  But this must be done; a person from the very beginning must feel responsibility and his own usefulness. <br><br>  The tasks for the first time I set very clearly.  Get such a project, such a library.  You need to make this feature work exactly this way (I don‚Äôt mention that there is some formulation that formally describes what functionality we should get from the user's point of view, we believe that it is).  You will encounter such systems (with explanations, where to find out about them, or from whom).  You will need to know this (with links to the docks).  If you have a misunderstanding, such a one will help you (of course, ‚Äúsuch a one‚Äù has already been warned and will then be asked about what was asked of him). <br>  Then gradually the degree of independence increases.  At some stage the task is set as follows.  Here is a statement from the menegers, look, and come to me tell me what you will do and how.  Purpose: after passing the chain of tasks, a person must master all the necessary technical skills, each put into practice, work with the bulk of our projects and learn how to make decisions independently. <br><br>  The first time I watch all commits.  For each line that I don‚Äôt like, I give an explanation of why, and I ask you to redo it.  And so it will not be "good."  I answer any questions, but I try not to say the answer, but to tell how to get it, or find it.  We must teach a person to quickly find the answers yourself. <br><br>  In parallel, 2 more learning processes are launched.  First, books on the theory of programming.  There is a replenished library for this.  The sequence and the need to determine individually.  Of some, please read only certain chapters.  The read material is fixed by using the "correct terms" in the discussion of tasks. <br>  Second, communication.  You must set the right mindset to communicate with colleagues, with testers in particular.  For example, I tell you in advance how to communicate with people who are looking for your mistakes, that you should be happy when they find them that these people help to do your job better.  That the answer to all their words can be of 2 types, or corrected, or a detailed explanation of why this should work that way, with their consent in return.  No emotions in this dialogue except positive are allowed.  The first time is to listen carefully to the dialogues and interfere.  I do this with colleagues; I give some of the tasks to work together.  The statement is usually very simple, it‚Äôs necessary to help this, he does this kind of work with such a deadline, he doesn‚Äôt have time.  (he does it in real time or not, it doesn‚Äôt matter :)))) Separate duties yourself.  Everything, no more details.  Then I communicate with both, draw conclusions, if necessary, I make corrections.  As a rule, a person has time to work with several colleagues before the end of the probationary period.  At the same time I tell you that when a colleague came to him, he must answer his question and help.  References to imaginary ‚Äúemployment‚Äù are unacceptable. <br><br>  Well, in the completion of several independent tasks to which a person speaks when he does them. <br>  The fighter is ready.  However, he has already done a lot.  His resume is substantially replenished.  He can work in a team and independently. <br><br>  Some moments may seem cruel or cynical.  But it is not.  A person can always come to me and ask any question.  I will answer and solve any of his working problems.  Or just come and talk.  We work together and work long. <br><br>  Not everything that was described was applied to everyone; it worked out with each person individually. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/36844/">https://habr.com/ru/post/36844/</a></p>
