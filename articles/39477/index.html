Perhaps, after the recent <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/38591/">announcement on Habr√©</a> , some of you even tried your hand as a ‚Äúinventor‚Äù of the original domains, names and slogans for companies.

      I will not describe the process of registering and working with the service itself - since this topic is written in the blog Modern Technologies of Creativity, we are not talking about this particular service and its advantages and disadvantages, but about why we need it specifically. <br><br>  Why do I go to Vot at least once a couple of days and spend from a few minutes to half an hour to invent domains for people I don‚Äôt know and most likely will never know? <br><br>  The thing is not at all in those 10-20 dollars that I can earn on every order with a good deal - I would do it for free (to be honest, this payment even bothers me - you might think that I work for food :)).  Another thing is important - I have the opportunity to train my brain every day - or rather, its creative component.  And it is interesting to do this on ‚Äúlive‚Äù tasks, taken from the real life of specific people.  Services like VoteName allow the brain to give such a daily intellectual warm-up exercises. <br><br>  In addition, I personally here is interesting as a springboard for practicing creative technologies ‚Äúby request‚Äù, which are used when you need to engage in creative activities not in rare moments of inspiration, but when it is necessary for business.  But more about that another time. <br><br>  And in the end - everyone who thinks that it‚Äôs easy to come up with an order domain - try to do it yourself.  For example, to me, a person who considers himself quite creative, it was useful to go down to earth, when many of the options that I thought were ‚Äúgold‚Äù were rejected by the client without hesitation (and some even at the stage of moderation by the service).  Suffice it to say that I put forward my options for about 20 tasks, while my option was chosen by the client as the final only in a single case (well, several times the options had the status ‚Äúlike the client‚Äù). <br><br>  Maybe you got better?  Boast in the comments :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39477/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39477/</a></p>
