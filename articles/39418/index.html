  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IPod inventor and other losers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Loser inventor.  This type is often found in books and movies.  Embittered at all, an unrecognized genius looks ridiculous or pathetic.  Throughout history, he either remains a clown, or, thanks to his beloved friends, overcomes himself and succeeds.  The story of the Englishman Kane Kramer has not yet been completed.  At the end of it, he may be lucky, or he could remain a loser.  But in any case, he does not look angry, pathetic or ridiculous, despite the fact that he recently had to close his own factory for the production of designer furniture, sell the house and move into rented housing with his family.  This is despite the fact that Kane Kramer de facto invented the iPod, bringing Apple 90 billion pounds. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>This is not a joke, dude!</b> <br>  In 2005, Apple received a claim from Burst.com.  The document required the payment of licensing fees for patents, allegedly used by the Yablochnik when creating the iPod.  In particular, it was about some principles of the organization of catalogs, navigation and management.  Steve Jobs and the company gave Burst.com a turnaround.  Then they went to court, demanding as much as $ 60 million. <br><br>  Apple lawyers were asked to search and not to pass.  And they found.  Kane Kramer.

      Here's how he talked about his first conversation with Jobs's lawyers to the Daily Mail newspaper: ‚ÄúI sat and painted when the bell rang.  The first thought was a joke.  But then I was invited to testify in California and had to believe. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>How I became a loser</b> <br><br>  In 1979, the 23-year-old Kane Kramer came up with the first digital player, although at that time only the first developments were being made on CDs, and no one even thought about mp3.  His device was a small box with a screen and navigation buttons.  The idea was embodied in plastic.  A prototype called IXI could play only 3.5 minutes of music - that was how much it was in his memory.  But at the same time, he was a real, one might even say, modern player. <br><br><img src="http://www.kosht.com/pics/_news/ixi.jpg"><br>  Kramer received a patent for the invention, which operated in 120 countries.  But in order to extend it in 1988 he needed 60 thousand pounds.  The inventor did not have such a sum and his intellectual property became public property. <br><br>  Cramer‚Äôs testimony was needed by Apple to prove that Burst.com‚Äôs patents aren‚Äôt so unique as to pay for it.  The inventor spoke in court, where his interrogation lasted 10 hours.  However, according to him, this was a pleasant procedure.  Finally, the world has recognized that the mp3 player, the device that changed the music industry, is its brainchild. <br><br>  As for compensation, Kramer was paid a consultation fee and donated an iPod, which he successfully lost in a few months.  It seems that the inventor is negotiating with Apple about getting some kind of reward, but this will be an exceptional charity on the part of the American company.  After all, the inventor has lost all rights. <br><br><img src="http://www.kosht.com/pics/_news/kramer.jpg"><br>  Meanwhile, since its first release in 2001, Apple has sold about 160 million iPods.  Find Kramer 60,000 pounds in 1988, today he would become a billionaire.  In a lawsuit against Burst.com, Apple managed to remove 14 counts.  As a result, the defendant was awarded 10 million dollars, 4.6 of which went to pay court costs. <br><br>  <b>The best reward loser - death</b> <br><br>  By the way, the recording industry is a real fount of losers.  Approximately the same as Cramer, no luck with Charles Cros.  It happened at the beginning of the recording.  Three months before Edison patented the phonograph, Cros presented his work ‚ÄúThe process of recording and reproducing phenomena perceived by the ear‚Äù to the French Academy of Sciences.  It described the process of fixing sound waves on rollers and disks.  The latter, by the way, belongs to the mind of Berliner, the inventor of the gramophone, after the appearance of which, as we know, Edison's phonographic business burned.  Cro's application did not arouse enthusiasm.  She lay pending until the end of the year.  When news about Edison's invention thundered, Charles also did not receive any appropriations for development.  This time because it was already late.  The merits of Cro recognized only descendants, calling in his honor the French Academy of Recording. But Cro and Kramer, by the way, have something in common even in their last names, can thank fate.  Yes, they are little known, but they are not rich, but at least they have not suffered from their offspring. <br><br>  William Bullock also made a revolution.  Only not in sound recordings, but in print.  In 1863, he invented the rotary printing press.  Served by only three workers, it could print 10,000 pages per hour.  The invention brought Bullock fame and money.  However, four years later, during the adjustment of the machine in the printing house of the Philadelphia Public Ledger newspaper, the inventor‚Äôs leg was pulled between the shafts.  He received a multiple fracture.  Two days later, gangrene began, and after nine, William Bullock died during an amputation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39418/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39418/</a></p>
