There is very dry air inside, beating on the eyes and skin, angry radiation (in fact, only in certain latitudes, and this applies only to many flying pilots), another pressure, meanly forcing you to fart. <br><br>  So skin and eyes.  An airplane, a chemical laboratory or a production workshop are one and the same.  Air conditioning dry air.  If the flight is more than 3 hours - the eyes will begin to burn, and rashes may occur on the skin.  You hardly need them, like red eye redness, so we are preparing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the case of a single short flight, do not do anything, just do not read further, otherwise you may have extra fears.  In the case of a long flight or frequent flights - you need to do a couple of non-stressful things.

      <b>First, to avoid bad rashes on the skin - moisturizer.</b>  Light over-dryness is pleasant to many, but there will be problems after the plane.  Go to the doctor and ask, the better to moisturize the skin.  If you do not want to see a doctor - go to the consultant at the pharmacy (sometimes there are separate ones on the skin), listen to him and buy an analogue other than his company.  You are interested in drugs with a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/geltek/blog/293149/">high molecular weight fraction of</a> hyaluronic acid, apple pectin, high molecular weight proteins (such as elastin), aloe vera.  It is necessary to exclude all alcohol-containing skin and all with surfactants. <br><br>  Lip balm is distributed in ‚ÄúTurkish Airlines‚Äù, for example, and in a couple of other companies.  You can ask for one more and spread it on your hands.  Just not on the eyes!  We need it in order not to get a mesh of small cracks upon landing.  In general, it is not important for a healthy person, but it is critical for a woman to reduce the likelihood of such an outcome, and you, guys with computers, are never healthy - you are our main consumer of eye gels and tear substitutes.  Therefore, once every 2 hours, moisturize the skin of the eyelids, so you will not become our (and pharmacy) regular customer.  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/geltek/blog/292283/">Dry eye syndrome</a> does not have a single trigger, it all accumulates. <br><br>  If you missed everything in preparation - take our Blefarogel 1 (but not the second one, do not mix it up), it will help to prevent anything bad with your eyes.  It is possible before the flight, when you red-eye in the code, but in flight, I <abbr title="(personal judgment: since this is a means of medical use, consult with a specialist)">recommend</abbr> it to anyone at all.  Even if Blefarogel did not have time - take a napkin, wrap a warm tea bag in it, and start massaging your eyelids with it.  A warm soft massage will help.  Several years ago, to wash those who have problems with dry eyes, we, together with the Research Institute of Eye Diseases of the RAMS, did Blefaroshampun - there is a base in the form of baby shampoo, water-soluble olive oil, extracts of chamomile, witch hazel, calendula, green tea.  It can be in the eyes. <br><br>  <b>Secondly, we must drink.</b>  It took two hours without water - clicked the call button of the flight attendant (do not hesitate) and ask for a glass.  Or two.  This is if the water is free, some people sell it in low-cost airlines.  Need to drink a liter for 3-4 hours.  The same applies to dry rooms, but for some reason people remember about the plane, but not about them.  Salt and sugar collect water, so you need to drink either tea or just pure water.  Tomato juice, cola - not the best choice.  Coffee slightly increases the loss of moisture due to the diuretic effect - but also refrain on long flights. <br><br>  Air humidity is usually around 20%.  Expect cramps in your eyes and cough, especially if you partake of alcohol a couple of hours before the flight (alcohol effectively binds water). <br><br>  <b>Third, eat a squirrel before flight.</b>  Better in 3 hours.  Steak, cottage cheese or steamed poultry with vegetables - perfect.  Legumes, grapes, bananas - cause bloating at the height.  In flight, the vessels of the nose will narrow, and the body will decide that all food is tasteless and abnormal.  Up to 80% of the data on the taste of food comes from the nose, so just remember that eating all the mustard from a serving is probably not the right idea. <br><br>  <b>Fourth, do a little exercise.</b>  Even in a small plane you can reach the toilet and warm up around it.  Get up at least once an hour.  The task is blood circulation.  25 squats work great. <br><br>  The pressure in the plane at the upper echelon can be at a height of 1800 meters, and the drop is quite sharp.  The expansion of air in the paranasal cavities and in the middle ear usually does not pose a problem, because there nature has carefully provided openings for frequent flyers.  But if you are cold - you cover, this flight will be remembered for a long time.  By the way, right away - do not use vasoconstrictor for nose and eyes.  Regardless of the common cold.  Vessels are subjected to overload in flight, and so they are not very good.  Namely, they are recommended that the nose is not laid.  By the way, if you have a funny snap in your nose or ear, this is a reason to go to the otolaryngologist after a trip, just in case. <br><br>  If you rock, you can drink dramines (if it suits you), this is the ultimate answer to all attempts by the body to throw out food.  It is better to do this for obvious reasons before the flight.  More and ushatyat, you fall asleep.  If you rock the beginning in the process - look at the horizon. <br><br>  It is better to wash on the spot (without soap) while waiting for the luggage.  If you want to quickly integrate into the local rhythm - walk half an hour under the sun or easily run. <br><br>  It may seem that to hell such difficulties, it's just a flight.  Yes, in general, you can not bother at all and forget about it.  But in fact, you don‚Äôt need stupid immunity excesses, either on an airplane (where it may not be very purely bacteriologically due to crowds of people), or on the ground in a new country, where there will be a wild load because of an unusual biome .  By the way, if you want to scare a talkative neighbor, be sure to tell her about the fact that there are a lot of bacteria in the clouds.  There is moisture, and some there is quite normal.  Just do not say that they almost do not get on the plane. <br><br>  About radiation - in the zone of auroras there is such a configuration of the earth‚Äôs magnetic field that the most ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù particles fly there.  That is why auroras are visible, by the way.  So, flights from New York to Europe often take place in this area.  If you fly there, you see the aurora - the radiation background you have exceeded, not only because of the lack of protection of the atmosphere, but also because of the best place on Earth for exposure.  It‚Äôs safe to do this about 40 times a year (depending on the country's standards), and each pilot records such flights - he, roughly speaking, has the choice of the first 20 flights between fuel economy and bonus and his risk, then you simply cannot choose the risk. <br><br>  As a result, I take on the plane only anesthetic (just in case), a means for the eyelids and our means for regeneration (you probably don‚Äôt need to, I have a habit of <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/geltek/blog/295219/">testing to</a> wear it everywhere). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/th/bj/o0/thbjo0bdiqgyd9vv5amssccjzca.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can also add anti-allergic and cream for the face and hands, but small. <br><br>  On board the aircraft there is a rather large first-aid kit with the flight attendants, they also know the first-aid and the peculiarities of using skills in flight.  They also have to have a defibrillator and an oxygen cylinder, but this is far from always the case - there was a case in my practice when I didn‚Äôt find the right one for the patient.  In general, our aircraft are subject to the methodological recommendations "Provision of civil aviation aircraft with drugs and medical products", who are interested - google the composition of equipment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374083/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374083/</a></p>
