And this concerns not only GTA, the developer and the publisher have other quite popular games.  For example, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> .  This is a third-person action-adventure western with an open world and RPG elements. <br><br>  Game Western has become so popular that there are those who want to connect the world of this game with GTA.  On March 18, fans of both games <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-03-21-fans-are-modding-red-dead-redemption-into-gta5">announced</a> the start of work on a mod, which was to be transferred to GTA V locations from Red Dead Redemption.  The announcement of the start of development was accompanied by a demonstration of <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-03-21-fans-are-modding-red-dead-redemption-into-gta5">screenshots of the</a> mod.  Tens of thousands of gamers eagerly awaited the completion of work, but, unfortunately, these expectations were in vain. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today, the same developers that announced the new mod in March, announced the termination of work on the project.  The disappointment is even stronger because shortly before this, the mods posted a video demonstrating the capabilities of their mod.  Now even access to this video is closed.  The reason - copyright infringement, in this case - the rights of the company Rockstar.  Obviously, the project attracted the attention of not only gamers, but also copyright holders.

      ‚ÄúI know that this is a bitter pill, but, as you could understand, we were contacted and after that we only had to state that the project was stopped,‚Äù <a href="http://gtaforums.com/topic/883655-wipv-red-dead-redemption-v/page-6">says the</a> Leaderwear modder, leader of the promising new product development group.  He said goodbye to those who expected the results of this work, stating the following: ‚ÄúThis should not have happened.  Excuse me". <br><br>  In the summer, the authors of the project were going to launch a beta test of their mod, the graphics of which should have been much better than on the PS3 and Xbox 360 platforms. It was even planned to add support for multiplayer, which could connect the world of GTA Online with the new world.  But since the authors of the mod used the graphics from the original version of the game action movie, the project was not viable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/71c/724/abd/71c724abd257a587e9e6c68cfb913641.png"><br><br>  In the details of the representative of the development team did not go, but in order to understand what was happening, you do not need to be Sherlock Holmes.  The YouTube video was blocked at the filing of Rockstar and its main division, Take-Two.  Lawyers appeared in the business who literally were able to kill on the vine this interesting undertaking.  Actually, this is not surprising. <br><br>  Nintendo, Capcom and other gaming companies more than once and not two prevented the emergence of fan projects created by gamers.  So now it's time to act for Rockstar, showing who's boss. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403439/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403439/</a></p>
