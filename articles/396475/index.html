This value is represented by an 8-bit unsigned number.  This number is equal to 255, since the input has a pull-up to the sensor supply minus through a 390 kΩ resistor.  When closing the pads 1 and 2, the read number is 0. This input can be used to control the brightness (using a photoresistor with a resistance of 100-500 kOhm) or as a water leakage sensor.  The sensing element is connected to the pads 1 and 2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ea/14e/204/8ea14e204bd6429592f2cf1698c59f42.PNG"><br><br>  An analog input is read every time sensors transmit parameters. <br><br>  <b>Motion Sensor PM111.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a0/e0a/283/3a0e0a28369f4fd999e2d4977d071951.PNG"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Specifications.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><table><tbody><tr><th>  Parameter </th><th>  Value </th></tr><tr><td>  The range of the thermal sensor </td><td>  0.5 ...  5m </td></tr><tr><td>  Photosensor threshold </td><td>  1 ... 100 lm </td></tr><tr><td>  Turn-on time after stopping </td><td>  5 seconds ... 21.8 minutes </td></tr><tr><td>  Radio transmitter frequency </td><td>  433.92 MHz (± 0.075 MHz) </td></tr><tr><td>  Radio transmitter power </td><td>  &lt;5 mW </td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum distance to receiver </td><td>  50 m </td></tr><tr><td>  Type of sensor batteries </td><td>  2xAAA (LR03) Alkaline 1.5V </td></tr><tr><td>  Battery life from one set of batteries </td><td>  not less than 1 year </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div></div><br><br>  <b>Sensor operation</b> <br><br>  When moving objects appear with a temperature above the environment in the sensor's range, it sends an activation command over the radio channel.  After a specified time after the termination of movement in the zone of the sensor, he gives the command to turn off.  In addition, the PM111 sensor is equipped with a photosensor for measuring illumination, which eliminates the response of the sensor in the daytime. <br>  The sensitivity of the thermal sensor, the threshold of illumination and the time of switching on the light after stopping the movement are regulated. <br><br>  <i>Notes</i> <br><ol><li>  The sensitivity of the thermal sensor depends on the direction of movement, size, temperature and speed of the object.  The worst sensitivity is obtained when driving straight <b>to</b> or <b>from the</b> sensor.  The best is perpendicular to this direction. </li><li>  When setting the maximum sensitivity of the thermal sensor, false positives are possible.  If this is unacceptable for you, then slightly desensitize the sensitivity of the thermal sensor with <i>the Sensitivity</i> knob. </li><li>  The range of adjustment of the threshold of the photosensor is indicated approximately, since the light sensors have a large scatter. </li><li>  A hysteresis is introduced into the light measurement algorithm, therefore, the thermal sensor is switched off at a higher light level than its activation. </li><li>  The range of the transmitter depends on the relative orientation of the receiver and transmitter antennas, the presence of obstacles between them and the freshness of the sensor batteries.  When the battery is completely discharged, the range can be significantly reduced. </li><li>  The discharge rate of the batteries depends on the current settings and the overall illumination of the room.  The longest service life will be in the provisions, <i>“Turn-on time”</i> –22 min, <i>“Illumination”</i> - minimum, <i>“Sensitivity”</i> - minimum, with good illumination. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>Modes of operation</b> <br><br>  If the illumination near the sensor is higher than that set by the <i>“Illumination”</i> regulator, then the sensor is in standby mode.  At the same time, its current consumption is minimal (less than 1 μA), and the thermal motion sensor is disconnected. <br>  When the illumination falls below a predetermined level, the sensor goes into standby mode. <br>  The heat sensor turns on, and the current consumption rises to 75 µA (approximately). <br>  Reverse transition to the standby mode occurs at a slightly higher level of illumination to eliminate multiple transitions there - back at sunset or dawn. <br>  If the <i>“Illumination”</i> regulator is located near the maximum (“On” position), then the sensor <br>  stays in standby mode always, with any light. <br><br>  Standby mode <br><br>  This mode is activated automatically when the illumination falls below the one set by the <i>“Illumination”</i> regulator or forcibly, if the <i>“Illumination”</i> regulator is in the “On” position. <br>  In this mode, the thermal sensor detects the movement of warm objects in the zone of its action. <br>  The size of the thermal sensor's range of action can be adjusted with the Sensitivity control. <br>  When motion is detected, the sensor transmits a command to the receiver by radio. <br>  When the movement has stopped, the sensor counts the interval set by the "Turn-on Time" knob and transmits a light-off command. <br>  If movement is detected again during the interval, the counting begins anew. <br>  Commands on and off are transmitted for reliability twice, with an interval of 2 seconds. <br>  After the first command has been given, the heat sensor turns off for 3.5 seconds, which means that the sensor does not feel the movement for 3.5 seconds after giving the shutdown command. <br><br>  All sensors can control the power supply charge.  When a battery discharge is detected, the sensor reports this with three short flashes of the LED indicator, repeated after 8 seconds.  Also the corresponding message is sent to the receiver. <br><br>  The FLProg program supports all the capabilities of these sensors. <br><br>  An example of working with sensors in the program FLProg. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yD_UrrbN9jE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgp8CunrpfgcB0FhG-n2p4J_RrT0A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I want to thank <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/smart_alex/" class="user_link">smart_alex</a> for his <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/274520/">article</a> .
