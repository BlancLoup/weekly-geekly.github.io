If the article begins with the words about "unique technology" I close the browser window. <br><br>  By type of activity, I translate foreign articles on e-commerce, advertising and marketing in new media and daily watch dozens of publications on this topic.  Alas, a rare article is quite informative and useful to read it further than the first paragraph.  Usually authors try to talk about how a TV commercial is being played on the Internet, calling it an innovative breakthrough in thought.  Or, the authors demonstrate their personal exhaust on the occasion of another resale for the seven-digit amount of a blown-up website for killing time.  Or they suck in another change of rules in calculations with Google advertisers. <br><br>  When something truly new is born, it happens without fanfare - just one day everyone understands that he could no longer do without it.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Breakthroughs in communication media are rare, but if they do happen, then getting used to new media happens instantly and deeply. <br><br>  As science fiction writer William Gibson said in a <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/17227831/william_gibson_the_rolling_stone_40th_anniversary_interview/print">November interview</a> with RollingStone magazine: ‚ÄúOne of the most amazing things our grandchildren find out about us is that we distinguish between online and offline, we distinguish ourselves at the moment of being connected to the Internet and at the moment when online no.  In the future, this will be completely unimaginable. ‚Äù <br><br>  I would add to the words of William that, apart from the border between the real and virtual worlds, the line between the real and the virtual personality is blurred. <br><br>  New tools for social self-expression are emerging - public diaries and photo albums, video and audio blogs - all that allows you to turn your life into a show behind glass. <br><br>  TV or paper book is not punched.  Everyone knows that these plots are mounted, edited, typeset and specially prepared.  This is an artificial show.  Another thing is a computer monitor - that's where everything is for real.  To revive the personality, she needs her own blog, an album with photos and preferably ICQ. <br><br>  The pioneers of new technologies, as usual, are advertising and pornography.  It was they who first poured a stream of interactive into their enticing scam, squeezing all possible creative resources for imitation of life.  Campaigns such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonelygirl">lonelygirl15</a> , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blair_Witch_Project">The Blair Witch Project</a> and <a href="http://campfirenyc.com/2006/10/05/beta-7/">Beta-7</a> have already become classics of viral marketing.  Chatbots, which gullible interlocutors sincerely <a href="http://blog.worldwebstudio.com/%3Fp%3D43">send declarations of love, are</a> growing wildly.  At the end of the performance, marketers calculate the number of clicks on the desired link and pages viewed. <br><br>  It was a big surprise for me that it was the big book business that drew attention to the magic of new media and took a step that was not just the first bell, but the heel of a new era. <br><br>  British publishing house Penguin cooperated with the firm Six to Start, which develops games on the subject of imaginary reality, and organized a campaign called We Tell Stories.  During this initiative, readers / viewers can enjoy what has been called ‚Äúelectronic fiction‚Äù (digital fiction).  Within six weeks, <a href="http://www.wetellstories.co.uk/">We Tell Stories</a> gradually publishes six stories from famous contemporary novelists.  But the main thing is the form of submitting texts. <br><br><img alt="We tell stories" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a14/2ab/bde/a142abbdedacad523696689fa1f85fde.jpg">  The first story was published under the name "21 step".  Readers are watching the adventures of the hero of this story right on the Google Maps electronic map, and the text of the work itself is displayed in fragments in the corresponding ‚Äúclouds‚Äù to describe the points on the map. <br><br>  The second story is about a girl and her parents who moved to a new home, of course, haunted.  At the same time, the girl herself and her parents keep their Internet diaries, as well as their microblogging on Twitter.  For four days, readers can watch the narration by reading their notes in their personal diaries. <br><br>  The action began on March 18 and will last another three weeks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23272/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23272/</a></p>
