  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Watchman syndrome</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/45d2d585/d86e78a5/e406ac6a/4f37edba.png" align="right">  Not long ago, a respected <a href="https://habr.com/users/freetonik/" class="user_link">freetonik</a> on Habr√© published an excellent <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/htranslations/126004/">translation of a</a> video from Richard Feynman.  Among the many instructive stories in it, I was very hooked on one ‚Äî about how 13-year-old Richard came to the library for a book on mathematics analysis and when asked by the librarian ‚ÄúWhy do you need it at your age?‚Äù Was forced to lie that it was for his father .  He was embarrassed and embarrassed then.  Something similar was once in my life. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I was in the seventh or eighth grade, the middle of the 90s was outside.  At a lesson in physics, one of my favorite subjects, somehow we were talking about something very highly specialized and interesting.  The teacher mentioned that he who prepares an extended report on this topic will be honored with respect and a well-deserved five.  Not that I really wanted the top five, but an interesting topic, coupled with the desire to show off my erudition - in general, I decided to do it.  Dig textbooks, home, school and regional teen library - nothing.  You could, of course, search the Internet - but back to the beginning of the paragraph and clarify the time of the story.  Where in those days come from the Internet? <br><br>  But there was another place in our city where one could try his luck - the Regional Scientific Library.  A huge brand new building on the central boulevard, windows, front of a flower bed and a fountain.  For me, it was something between the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%258B">Institute of Time</a> from ‚ÄúGuest from the Future‚Äù and <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%2598%25D0%2598%25D0%25A7%25D0%2590%25D0%2592%25D0%259E">NIICAVO</a> from the Strugatsky books.  It all said that this place is filled with wisdom, and it‚Äôs all people working for, whose purpose in life is to bring the light of knowledge to the people. <br><br>  So I went.  And what did I see?  Empty rooms, dust-covered shelves, and a couple of post-Balsac librarians.  But it did not shock me.  It turned out that only students, graduate students and teachers can use the Regional Scientific Library.  Well nakraynyak people related to work in science (journalists, laboratory technicians, technologists).  But certainly not schoolchildren!  You, shalopai, they say, everything is mixed up, break and lose.  So nefig.  As a last resort - bring a letter from the school principal and parents, so that an excellent student, an olympiad and a good boy, and then maybe ... And besides, for registration you need to pay a certain amount - something about 2 dollars for today's money.  Well, what is 2 dollars today?  Bullshit.  But where does the schoolchild of those years come from?  Even for the budget of my parents-engineers, then it was quite a money.

      In general, I turned around and left.  The report remained not written, the five not received.  Not that my life went downhill after that, I began to drink, smoke, and a year later I sat down on an article - no.  But it was a shame.  The next time I crossed the threshold of this library almost 10 years later, a graduate of the university in search of a list of references for the graduation project.  Of course, there was already the Internet and I didn‚Äôt need any literature, but the scientific director said that it‚Äôs impossible to write MSDN and Google in the diploma - we need respected authors and thick monographs.  Well - for this decade so much has changed that neither in a fairy tale to say, nor to describe with a pen.  But not in this library.  There were all the same watch librarians, watching the meaningless emptiness and silence of the cool halls.  This time I had a student ID card and the amount needed for registration, so there were no problems.  But right after me, a young boy of about 15 came up to the reception desk and asked how he could get a couple of books on chemistry.  And guess what happened next?  That's right!  The same lecture 10 years ago about who can read smart books here, and who is not yet allowed.  The guy scared apologized and turned around.  I wanted to do a good deed and offered him to take any books in my name, but he looked at me suspiciously and refused.  In principle, I understand him - the picture of the logical world had just collapsed in his head and faith in humanity was lost, and then some unfamiliar uncle offered a free hand of help, but what for him just in case.  The boy left, and I expressed to the librarian in the hearts how wrong they are in the customer service policy.  To no avail, of course. <br><br><h4>  Why am I leading all this? </h4><br>  <b>First</b> , it is necessary <s>to</s> fire such librarians.  Immediately and without thinking.  And at the same time with them all suffering <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585%25D1%2582%25D1%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">janitor syndrome</a> .  How many more young people across the country and the world were sewn away in similar situations by librarians, received the answer ‚Äúit‚Äôs too early for you to know‚Äù from mediocre teachers, they said ‚Äúget off‚Äù from parents who don‚Äôt want to spend time with the child, etc.  The role of all the above people is to guide and help, not send and forget.  If they do not understand this, well, it means there was nothing to go to librarians, teachers, or become parents. <br><br>  <b>Secondly</b> , I watch from time to time for attempts here and there to establish control over the Internet, create Great Firewalls and decide what can be read to whom and what cannot.  And every time mixed feelings arise in me - from aggression to those who do it, to sympathy with him (since they will inevitably be overthrown by their people).  Free access to information on the Internet, it is time to enter into a set of universal human rights and guarantee constitutions and international laws.  I myself want to decide whether I need social networks, opposition sites and an independent press.  Damn it, even banners and porn!  More recently, after the riots in London, the police said that marauders coordinated their raids on shops using Facebook and Twitter and offered to cut them off in Britain until better times.  This was seriously discussed in Parliament.  Glory to Reason, normal people are still sitting there and they did not go for it (and therefore the British government will remain in power for a long time, but there are no other countries that allowed themselves similar measures). <br><br>  I would like to finish in the spirit of the well-known <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582_%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">hacker manifesto</a> : it is impossible to limit the spread of information in the modern world; anyone who tries to do this will always be defeated.  And if you have the opportunity to contribute to this - do not be afraid to do it, the truth is on your side. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126255/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126255/</a></p>
