We uploaded videos of Joker 2018 reports and, according to tradition, made a selection of the top ten reports from the opinion of conference visitors. <br><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cx/mj/f3/cxmjf3surtqutzwh5qef1qlrw1s.jpeg"></p><br><br>  All reports go from ‚Äújunior‚Äù to ‚Äúsenior‚Äù by rating, but the differences between the places of the reports of the top ten are minimal and depend heavily on the assessment methodology.  Slightly changing the method, you can greatly change places.  So look at everything!  Interestingly, Joker 2018 reports have one of the highest average ratings for all time.

This is a simple but useful story by the founder of Agile Developer about how inevitable problems arise in development - both ordinary and fundamental, as well as how to solve them. <br><br>  Changes in any created system, including in applications, should be easy and cost-effective, but this is much easier said than done.  And in his story Venkat just lists the main places in which we make the application unnecessarily complex - unreadable code, unnecessary configurations, dependencies, the desire to introduce new technologies and attempts to solve a simple problem in a complex way, which leads to even greater problems. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Keynout: a new reality of digital civilization </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Andrey Kurpatov</b> <br>  Location: 9 <br>  Rating: 4.23 <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/6y9ypnmQtaSQCsUoq44YkO/f08f060bb2047f6694da6f8ecc736af9/Andrey_Kurpatov_New_reality_of_digital_civilization.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ePK82v0d6W8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the 20th century, a person has received less information in his life than he has in a week - but this is too short a period for the brain to evolve and adequately perceive everything that it sees.  What should be done in such a situation, and how has the information environment influenced human thinking?  What threatens our brain aggressive information environment?  What are the main problems of human intelligence?  How to improve the efficiency of your thinking using the latest brain science research? <br><br>  Psychotherapist Andrei Kurpatov, the keynote closing the conference, answers these questions.  His report became interesting and, as we see from the reviews, a successful experiment.  Listeners, speakers and conference participants ideally fall under the category of ‚Äúinformation-dependent‚Äù (after all, one of the goals of attending a conference or reading posts in Habr√© is to get even more information). <br><br>  And according to the audience, they were forced to think about the story of information pseudo-ambivalence, digital dementia and other unpleasant effects of information noise and to rethink their lives a little.  And it's worth it, even if the topic does not affect Java so much. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Distributor ok.ru/music </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Vadim Tsesko ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/incubos/" class="user_link">incubos</a> )</b> <br>  Location: 8 <br>  Rating: 4.26 <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/5czD77g8o8keMgO2WUmQsO/fadb0cea120792fb0d60dbf0109a012d/Vadim_Tsesko_Reactive_ok.ru_music_streamer.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ATjbGyzTz54" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  At the seventh or eighth place is a story about the practical application of reactive technologies on the example of the music distributor in Odnoklassniki, which is suitable for all who are interested or need to design a high-load working system. <br><br>  Vadim considers various concepts, tricks and architectural solutions that were implemented in the new version of the distributor, the total traffic of which reaches 100 GB / s through hundreds of thousands of connections, and the time to the first byte is no more than 100 ms. <br><br>  In the presentation there are additional links for deeper immersion in the subject, fine-tuning to increase system performance, simplify debugging and operating the system.  In general, practice, practice, and nothing but practice.  Those who are in the subject line are required to watch! <br><br><hr><br><h2>  The Adventures of Senor Holmes and Junior Watson in the Software Development World [Joker Edition] </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Evgeny Borisov ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/evgenyborisov/" class="user_link">EvgenyBorisov</a> ), Baruch Sadogursky ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/jbaruch/" class="user_link">jbaruch</a> )</b> <br>  Location: 7 <br>  Rating: 4.26 <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/5lvrk3Oh3OE6syocaMUoqy/74a7c62d5dfdb3d94b184a6260016632/Baruch_Sadogursky_Evgeny_Borisov_The_adventures_of_Senior_Holmes_and_Junior_Watson_in_the_world_of_software_development__Jok.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RBhf8TPy5i4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ‚Äú- Sherlock, why does nothing work again? <br>  - It's elementary, my friend!  First, you are trying to run the fifth Spring on Java 7. Secondly, after a couple of months of using Groovy, you completely ceased to respect semicolons.  But thirdly, the battery in your laptop died <br><br>  Baruch and Eugene's remarkable detective performance, playing up Spring features with a new, in comparison with the JPoint, ‚Äúcase of a German spy‚Äù.  Holmes and Watson uncovered several riddles in the life of developers about Spring's bins, documentation, and exceptions.  Even if not very much in the topic - be sure to look, the plot of the duo's report is very catchy and fascinating. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Java process memory by shelves </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Andrey Pangin ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/apangin/" class="user_link">apangin</a> )</b> <br>  Location: 6 <br>  Rating: 4.32 <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/3L8FOotpVeIsGAEqS6w0oi/cc1be8ce87bbd5012db5d8d7308f3ae5/Andrey_Pangin_Sorting_out_memory_of_a_Java_process.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kKigibHrV5I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Enchanting arrangement of points over why Java eats memory.  All that you wanted to know, all that you guessed about, and what you would dream in nightmares.  After all, not only virtual machines, but also libraries and user applications can be greedy, and problems can hide in the most unexpected places. <br><br>  The report can be used as a complete guide to action to solve memory leak problems.  The most important thing is that the tools with which you can see and touch the memory consumption are disassembled.  It is recommended not only to watch the report, but also to go through all the steps of speaking in your own projects and update problem areas. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Java Puzzlers NG S04: Ha, with this release cycle, it looks like puzzle players are with you for a long time </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Baruch Sadogursky ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/jbaruch/" class="user_link">jbaruch</a> ), Tagir Valeev ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/lany/" class="user_link">lany</a> )</b> <br>  Location: 5 <br>  Rating: 4,33 <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/6EjjVs8A12CO2AUWK8oe86/933e2651cdbbd20d8a489ac3603049f7/Baruch_Sadogursky_Tagir_Valeev_Java_Puzzlers_NG_S04_Ha__it_seems_that_with_this_release_cycle_puzzlers_came_here_to_stay_.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7PnYBYL9pnc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The fourth season of Java Pazzler - Oracle does not stop and brings all the new surprises, which Baruch (this time in a frog costume - hello JFrog) and Tagir tell in an interactive and humorous way. <br><br>  The rules of puzzlers are simple - you need to choose one of the answers, how the selected piece of code will behave.  A deep, informative and fun report, after which you will have a look at some things in Java from a different perspective.  Be sure to take a look. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Walking dead objects, or GC is always right </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Ivan <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/dbg_nsk/" class="user_link">Uglyansky</a> ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/dbg_nsk/" class="user_link">dbg_nsk</a> )</b> <br>  Location: 4 <br>  Rating: 4,35 <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/ItUi3ddFeKUAcsMGYiwAw/4797f279bcd532a5374da61bb8d12dce/Ivan_Ugliansky_Walking_Dead_Objects_or_GC_is_always_right.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XtijbFcQxyw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Automatic memory management is one of the main features of Java and other managed languages.  At the same time, very little is written in the GC specification: it is proposed to decide independently how to collect garbage for each specific implementation of JVM.  As a result, there are a huge number of strategies and degrees of freedom for garbage collection.  For example, when exactly should a GC come for a dead object?  The answer is not so obvious, and any decision may affect the course of execution of the user program. <br><br>  Yes, this is a report about GC, but with a good practical presentation and elements of a thriller, in which Ivan Uglyansky tells why the collector leaves dead objects in memory, how it affects the application and how to survive during the invasion of walking dead objects. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Do not think about quality, think about speed. </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Yegor Bugaenko ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/yegor256/" class="user_link">yegor256</a> )</b> <br>  Location: 3 <br>  Rating: 4,35 <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/11nl9qKjTKUy0qAmC46Kam/9278a84d294d5ef8286c5c81a632ce44/Yegor_Bugayenko_Don_t_aim_for_quality__aim_for_speed.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jFSSV1pdZTw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Yegor's classic talk is provocative, igniting and useful.  This time it touches upon the topic of software quality and why code quality is a necessary condition of the working environment, and not a developer‚Äôs task, as it seems to everyone. <br><br>  In his opinion, programmers should be fast, not quality, and close tasks as soon as possible in order for the project to develop and continue to live.  This is a non-standard look at the software development process, which was highly appreciated by the listeners and viewers of Joker (for example, Baruch came to him and started asking questions in an intuitive manner), and found him very useful, despite the provocation. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Pattern matching and his imaginary friends </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Tagir Valeev ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/lany/" class="user_link">lany</a> )</b> <br>  Location: 2 <br>  Rating: 4,47 <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/3LvL6bfbSwMueGIIk4kgMg/6f947c55d422fb5d5dddb1b1a678de26/Tagir_Valeev_Pattern_matching_and_its_imaginary_friends.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qurG_J81_Cs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The case when the report is led by an expert in the language and is ready to delve into any related topic.  Affordable, high-quality and, despite the seriousness of pattern matching, a pretty funny story about how Java authors see PM, what other new features are required, to make it convenient to use, and whether the light is visible at the end of the tunnel. <br><br>  He reveals the details of the work of the IDE developer, describes how the developers of the new API face problems and in an accessible form explains where the language is moving and how it develops.  Very worthy performance and well-deserved place in the top ten.  We recommend that you familiarize yourself with everything, whatever the level of training. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Reactive spring </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Josh Long</b> <br>  Location: 1 <br>  Rating: 4.57 <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uUscStPwLlQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Josh Long, the coolest Spring Evangelist in the world, completes our selection. He usually opens Java conferences around the world, answers community questions, does Spring Tips, and much more. <br><br>  Josh can talk easily about complex things and on Joker 2018 he was able to fit into the live coding report on Reactive Spring many things: Netty-based web runtime, Spring WebFlux, Spring Data Kay, Spring Security 5.0, Spring Boot 2.0, Spring Cloud Finchley.  He explains what the Reactive API is and how to work with it on live examples with a cheerful presentation of material.  Very fast, both funny and very useful! <br><br>  By the way, listeners recommend listening to Josh along with a report on the ‚ÄúOdnoklassniki‚Äù jet distributor of music, so if you miss it, scroll up and see.  And according to their own words, after Josh's speech, I want to ‚Äúbuild applications using Reactive Spring right now!‚Äù. <br><br><blockquote>  The full playlist with all reports <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLVe-2wcL84b9vrSPYN8N97XPCv7d-H5KJ">is available here</a> .
