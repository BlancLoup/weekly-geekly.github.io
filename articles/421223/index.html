Autumn is looming in Petersburg sky, which means that soon there will be DevFest SPB 2018! </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ff/ja/0l/ffja0lswwrtpseiq1ylihvg7vra.png"></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4 id="chto-takoe-devfest">  What is DevFest? </h4><br><p>  Google loves technology, especially when interested in them, and interest societies arise around them.  This is what the GDG (Google Developer Group) was created for.  This is a non-profit organization whose purpose is to assist in learning technologies, sharing knowledge, organizing and conducting meetings and conferences all over the Earth.  And the main milestone in the annual activity of such local groups in a huge number of cities is the autumn wave of DevFest! </p><br><p>  Judge for yourself: <a href="https://developers.google.com/events/devfest/directory/">in this impressive list</a> you can find conferences from Argentina to Siberia and from Uganda to India. </p><br><p>  We also could not <strong><a href="https://devfest-spb.com/">stand</a></strong> aside, so we are glad to present you the announcement of the <strong><a href="https://devfest-spb.com/">DevFest 2018 in St. Petersburg</a></strong> <br>  At the helm, remained known to you: <br>  <strong>Andrei Dmitriev</strong> - a guy from JUG.ru and the creator of <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/">Mobius</a> <br>  <strong>Artur Vasilov</strong> - Android from <a href="https://yandex.ru/">Yandex</a> <br>  <strong>Seryoga Ryabov</strong> - our free Kotlin-evangelist from <a href="https://www.joom.com/">Joom</a> <br>  and <strong>Dasha Gorchakova</strong> - PR Bee Agency <a href="https://wehive.digital/">Hive</a> <br>  And also joined the team <br>  <strong>Lyonya Kalneus</strong> - one of the founders of the largest <a href="https://gdg-siberia.com/">DevFest in Siberia</a> <br>  and I - <strong>Kostya Tskhovrebov</strong> - an android architect in St. Petersburg <a href="https://www.redmadrobot.com/">Redmadrobot</a> </p><br><h4 id="gde-i-kogda">  Where and when? </h4><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nz/jf/sx/nzjfsxympdwcwg33atj3n9b8wig.jpeg"><br>  <strong>November 27 - Med. Ave., 3</strong> <br>  If you, dear reader, were with us last year, you probably noticed that we changed the name a bit: now it's DevFest SPB. <br>  In addition to the name, the place has changed, the conference site this year is the <em>former factory LenPolygraphMash</em> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dh/ob/im/dhobimk8px9p9b9cfmw_tvlj9ki.png"><br>  Now the entire territory of the plant is being rented to various companies, including Redmadrobot.  Robots have always been and are at the very edge of modern technology, so they gladly agreed to participate in organizing the conference and provided us with a convenient platform located close to the metro (and also completely under the iron side of the robots). </p><br><h4 id="komu-stoit-idti">  Who should go? </h4><br><p>  Personally, I have always believed that in a conversation with a professional, you can learn something new and interesting, which you can not meet in normal practice.  In addition, it is useful to get acquainted with other views on known problems, to look a little deeper.  I am still silent about the reports themselves and the discussion of the issues raised. <br>  Therefore, my opinion is: if you are a practicing engineer, a novice intern, or simply not indifferent to modern IT technologies, then we must meet very soon! </p><br><h4 id="pervye-spikery">  First speakers </h4><br><p>  This is only an announcement, but we are already shaping our program.  This year there will be two parallel tracks, with 7 reports each.  Reports will be related to Android, Web and other hot topics. <br>  Here are some of them: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/il/ri/bv/ilribvduye89imo84b5dkpzwll8.jpeg"><br>  <strong>Royi Benyossef, Google Developer, Samsung NEXT.</strong>  <strong>Tel-Aviv, Israel</strong> <br>  Royi still ‚ÄúLoves Russia, Android and public appearances!‚Äù. </p><br><p>  He already spoke at the first St. Petersburg DevFest last year, becoming one of the main discoveries of the conference, and this year he again applied for participation. <br>  Now the program committee is in the process of choosing from several of its reports. <br>  Recall that last year Royi talked about aspects of UX and some tricks you can use to improve the performance and usability of your application.  The report was called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DzDlkbfyvE5s%26t%3D262s">‚ÄúDon't use it or lose it!‚Äù</a> <br>  Soon we will tell you that we are waiting for you this year (follow the program on the <a href="https://devfest-spb.com/">site</a> ). </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sa/lj/og/saljogoa6ubccduviqhq8yeirh0.jpeg"><br>  <strong>Alexander Efremenkov</strong> <br>  ‚ÄúI write code, I look in Android‚Äù. </p><br><p>  <strong>Report ‚ÄúD8 / R8 vs DX / Proguard‚Äù</strong> <br>  In Android, the toolchain added a new compiler - D8 (Dope 8), which allows you to compile faster than DX and have the smallest final apk size, and also R8 - the replacement of ProGuard.  In this report we will try to understand these updates, as well as compare and understand how D8 compiles against the good old DX, why did the second ProGuard, and how stable this all is. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p3/7s/dl/p37sdlucpyc0xch_1ddl0vjj0ao.jpeg"><br>  <strong>Tanay Pant, Berlin, Germany</strong> <br>  Mozilla official representative <br>  Author, hacker, developer and technology enthusiast. </p><br><p>  <strong>‚ÄúDeveloping cross browser web extensions‚Äù</strong> <br>  In my talk, I will talk about 3D objects on the Internet, virtual reality, VR devices, WebVR, WEBVR API and creating multiplayer games with A-Frame. <br>  I will also demonstrate creating a multiplayer game similar to Pokemon Go using WebXR in a real-time coding session.  Live coding will cover topics such as creating a game scene, importing 3D objects, interacting with objects, adding animation, implementing WebAR, and adding multiplayer capabilities to the game with real-time databases.  By the end of the session, participants will have a complete understanding of what WebXR is, and they will be able to create cross-browser web applications, as well as multiplayer games like Pokemon Go. </p><br><h4 id="a-skolko-eto-udovolstvie-stoit">  And how much is this fun worth? </h4><br><p>  Since no one wants to get rich at this conference, all the money from the purchased tickets will go to pay for the placement of speakers, the road and organizational needs. </p><br><p>  The price of the main ticket starts from <strong>2000 rubles</strong> and will gradually grow to <strong>3,500 rubles</strong> as the conference day approaches - it is better not to postpone it later! </p><br><p>  And if you are also a student, we will be doubly happy to support your desire for knowledge!  Therefore, a student card costs <strong>1000 rubles</strong> ! </p><br><p>  It seems to me that now there should be no doubts. </p><br><h4 id="ya-tut-takuyu-interesnuyu-shtuku-znayu">  I know such an interesting thing here ... </h4><br><p>  So you can tell a lot!  Send your topic with a small description <strong>to us at <a href="https://www.papercall.io/devfestspb">CFP</a></strong> , and we will definitely study it, and it‚Äôs not very likely that you will soon be on DevFest from the other side of the stage (almost like a rock star). </p><br><h4 id="drugaya-informaciya">  Other information </h4><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mg/ux/nc/mguxncitnztmmepxjexohnaoomi.png"><br>  All other information can be viewed on <a href="https://devfest-spb.com/">our website</a> . <br>  The program is updated there, you can buy tickets, study the map to the site and much more. </p><br><p>  If you still have any questions, you can ask them in the <em><a href="https://t.me/joinchat/A7S8Y0CHwcjbdRbSY4MuJw">conference chat.</a></em> </p></div>
