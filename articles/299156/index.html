  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who is moneymaker</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some of my acquaintances with a proud look call themselves moneymakers.  Honestly, they are pretty annoying to me.  I analyzed what exactly they annoy me and on the basis of this I tried to highlight the common in these pseudo-businessmen. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  How to recognize moneymaker </h5><br>  <b>1.</b> Moneymakers love to teach people a lot.  Business in training courses and programs brings them a significant portion of income. <br>  <b>2.</b> At the same time, they generate very low quality content.  This is due to the fact that they themselves recently learned what they are going to talk about for money. <br>  <b>2.1.</b>  The basic principle of moneymaker: I learned something new - sell for money. <br>  <b>2.2.</b>  They do not bother with the method of presentation.  At best, their texts are a copy-paste of the source of information. <br>  <b>3.</b> All of their sites are usually ‚Äúone-page‚Äù across multiple screens. <br>  <b>3.1.</b>  And they begin with a question in which all words are written with a capital letter.  For example: "Do You Want to Get Everything And Go?" <br>  <b>3.2.</b>  Then without fail there is a photo of the author.  Moneymakers think that it‚Äôs very important for the buyer to see the author‚Äôs face.  Without this, in their opinion, it is impossible to conclude about the quality of the content.  Like, look at those honest eyes - can they lie? <br>  <b>3.3.</b>  And it is mandatory to scan signatures. <br>  <b>3.4.</b>  There are always customer reviews on the site, which upon careful consideration turn out to be the same moneymakers. <br>  <b>3.5.</b>  At the bottom there are always two course prices.  One before the decline, the other after.  The price before the decline is always crossed out, but the same is not clear.  The price after the decline is always two times lower than the original. <br>  <b>4.</b> From points <b>3.2.</b>  and <b>3.3.</b>  it can be concluded that moneymakers are addicted to narcissism. <br>  <b>5.</b> In part, this is confirmed by the way they like to talk about their more than modest successes.  For example: ‚ÄúIn total my blog for 3 months was visited by 29 thousand 38 people who viewed 108'047 pages.  The average length of a blog is 4 minutes. ‚Äù <br>  <b>6.</b> Based on clause <b>3.4.</b>  it can be concluded that the moneymaker has its own party and its own authorities. <br>  <b>7.</b> In their get-together, it is customary to talk about each other ‚Äúa well-known Internet entrepreneur‚Äù (well-known AMONG WHOM ???) and ‚Äúa respected Internet activist‚Äù (dear to KEM ???) <br>  <b>8.</b> Moneymakers love affiliate programs very much.  These programs are very reminiscent of the pyramids, but moneymaker-s in every way deny it. <br>  <b>9.</b> Moneymakers do not like criticism very much, but the manner of their counter-arguments (‚ÄúI went to x ..‚Äù) suggests that, in principle, they understand their place in this world. <br>  <b>10.</b> Partly as confirmation of clause <b>9. also</b> serves to the fact that the real authorities of the Runet (for example, from here <a href="http://ezhe.ru/fri">ezhe.ru/fri</a> ) they avoid in every possible way. <br>  <b>11.</b> Also, moneymakers visit few professional resources, even in the area in which they generate content.  Very often they simply do not know about the existence of these resources. <br><br><h5>  Past present Future </h5><br>  I did not specifically investigate the history of the flow of moneymakers in Runet.  But I can assume that their rapid growth was primarily due to the low literacy of the Internet audience in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  Now the Internet is increasingly penetrating our lives and therefore less illiterate housewives are ready to pay money. <br><br>  Due to the crisis, moneymakers should become more, because  there is an illusion about their high incomes without financial and temporary investments.  However, due to the same crisis, there are big doubts about the maintenance of the volume of sales, not to mention the growth.

      In the long run, moneymakers do not expect anything good.  It is precisely because the audience is becoming more educated. <br><br>  That's all I wanted to say. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299156/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299156/</a></p>
