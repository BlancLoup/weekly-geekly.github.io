  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Programmer's Mortal Sins</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I know that my voice will remain the voice of the administrator crying in the wilderness.  Who am I actually?  Just an administrator, a miserable likeness of the demiurge, who is the Programmer.  He is the creator of existence, and my destiny is just to keep his creations working and pray that the flocks, that is, the users, would not crucify me when something is not working for them. <br><br>  But even the Programmer is a sinner if he does not keep the seven commandments. <br><br><h4>  Do not think flock pastor </h4><br>  The programmer likes to believe that the user who starts the program is like the administrator.  Alas, alas, no one gave him such a right most often, so if the Programmer didn‚Äôt think about it, the Simurg bird lifts its wings over the administrator. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This sin is now becoming increasingly rare, but its fruits are still abundantly plentiful.  So, for example, the path of the ‚ÄúYa.Online‚Äù application, which requires administrative rights from the launching user, is required to upgrade the Jabber module.

      An important subtype of this commandment will be an important knowledge: installing the program will not always be its user!  Therefore, you need a switch "Install for all" and "Install for me."  Alas, a very small percentage of installers understand this.  For example, the ‚ÄúDeclaration‚Äù software package from the Federal Tax Service does not know this at all. <br><br>  From the first commandment follows the second: <br><br><h4>  Do not want entries in the application directory </h4><br>  Since the user is not similar to the administrator, he can only read those files that are located in the program folder.  Just read, but never write!  For a user, there is his home directory (or profile) where you can humbly write files. <br><br>  This sin is extremely abundant, and its fruits are ugly.  For example, the program "Documents PU-5" from the Pension Fund or CheckXML from it, they believe that DBF-file indices can be perfectly recorded in the folder with the program!  Woe to them, woe. <br><br>  From the second commandment follows the third: <br><br><h4>  Do not want much from the user profile </h4><br>  Be humble in your desires!  And if you are so modest, then be even more modest!  Remember that a user profile can be relocatable, that is, make a pilgrimage to the file halls of the file server and back when the user logs in and out of the system. <br><br>  The user will be able to desecrate his desktop with multi-gigabyte video files, so he will be remembered by his legion of devilish devices. <br><br>  This sin was met in the mail client Thunderbird, which lined up the search index of the available letters in the IMAP mailbox.  A file with a size of 2-3 gigabytes was immodestly placed in a roaming user profile folder.  Sad, sad face administrator such a computer. <br><br>  Be sure that the installation of programs in the user profile looks extremely dubious, which he likes to do, for example, the Chrome browser (and the version for all computer users must be downloaded separately).  The first commandment says that the user is not an administrator.  And then the program that is installed in the user profile should be completely autonomous from the environment where it is executed.  What is extremely rare (Chrome here, just an exception). <br><br>  From the third commandment follows the fourth: <br><br><h4>  Do not believe in eternal truths </h4><br>  If you want to know the path to the folder with the user profile, then reject the temptation to think that it is on the way Documents and Settings or in the Users folder.  There are special prayers that help to know the truth and find almost any user folder for any purpose. <br><br>  It would be a sad mistake and a prejudice to assume that the program is installed in the Program Files folder, since nowadays 64-bit operating systems are not uncommon!  This sin is peculiar to some systems for working with the bank, for example, from MDM Bank OJSC. <br><br><h4>  Not small </h4><br>  Yes, true orthodoxies remember the times when the screens were the size of a needle eye, through which they tried to drag a camel.  But those times have sunk into oblivion, and the current computer screens are great, appealing and full of color. <br><br>  So, discard the font with a size of 11 pixels, and may grace be with you with a resolution of 1920 by 1200. Reject the font size setting in pixels once and for all, but use proportional units. <br><br><h4>  Do not rush to run for progress </h4><br>  All administrators know that Windows XP support ends on April 8, 2014, but not everyone is afraid of it!  You never need to repair what works, and for many, this system works and how. <br><br>  Therefore, calm your passion in using the most modern components and try to make sure that even retrogrades can know the sweet fruit of your labors. <br><br><h4>  Do not forget about other languages </h4><br>  Blessed are the developers who initially create their products in a non-English-speaking atmosphere, for they will inherit a competent approach.  However, not all foreign programmers generally know that one character can occupy (blasphemy!) More than one byte!  The story of Babylon should teach everyone - remember that there is Unicode, and better - read the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">revelation from Joel</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189180/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189180/</a></p>
