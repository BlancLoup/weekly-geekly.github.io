  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Localization of mobile applications (with Nokia)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few days ago, we at ABBYY Language Services announced the launch of a large-scale joint project with Nokia, the purpose of which is to support Russian developers in localizing their mobile applications and help them successfully sell software around the world.  I will tell about how the idea of ​​such cooperation arose, and what happened in the end. <br><br>  Mobile applications, as a rule, are initially focused on distribution in the global market.  This is facilitated by the industry’s adopted distribution model — through online app stores.  An infrastructure has been created for every popular mobile platform that allows developers to sell software worldwide.  Therefore, the explosive growth in the number of mobile applications in the last 2-3 years has led to an equally impressive increase in the demand for their localization. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On October 13, Common Sense Advisory, a leading consulting company in the field of linguistic services and technologies, published a <a href="http://www.commonsenseadvisory.com/Research/Report_Abstracts/101013_Expanded_Opportunities/tabid/2100/Default.aspx">fresh study</a> that predicted the demand for localization of 12 different types of products over the coming year.  The top three are SaaS applications (19.7% of all localized products), websites (20.4%) and — in the first place — mobile applications (23.9%).  <b>In other words, almost a quarter of all applications that will be localized within the next year are mobile applications.</b> 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, we regularly see what difficulties the developers have when they are puzzled at the last moment by localization.  There is a lack of information on when the localization of a product to a particular language will have a positive ROI (return on investment), what national differences exist in different countries, where you can first do English, and where the lack of a local version means no sales .  How to properly prepare the application for localization, what requirements need to be laid out at the design stage, in order not to complicate and increase the cost of the localization process later, and about which technologies help to reduce localization costs and improve its quality.  This is quite valuable information, especially for small and medium-sized companies developing mobile software. <br><br>  For Nokia developers, localization issues are particularly relevant.  If in the Apple AppStore, for example, most of the sales fall on the territory of the United States, then the OVI Store, the Nokia application store, is truly an international structure.  <b>Most customers come to the OVI Store from countries such as China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Turkey and the United Kingdom.</b> <br><br>  Nokia approached us with a proposal to create a localization service that would increase developer literacy on localization, increase the quantity and quality of localized versions of products, and ultimately increase sales of these products at the OVI Store.  The result of our collaboration you can see <a href="http://russia.forum.nokia.com/Distribute/localization.html">here</a> .  <b>A special section has appeared on the Russian website Forum.Nokia with recommendations for developers, and in addition, a button for getting free advice from ABBYY Language Services specialists.</b> <br><br>  ABBYY has extensive experience in selling software abroad, and we hope that our knowledge and technology will help Russian developers to make their products competitive in the global market. <br><br>  <i>Yegor Zaikin</i> <i><br></i>  <i>ABBYY Language Services</i> <br><br>  <i><a href="http://blog.perevedem.ru/%3Fp%3D1204">Original</a> post on the blog ABBYY Language services</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107340/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107340/</a></p>
