But the hormones of such fame have not yet been honored - although they deserve it no less.  <a href="https://atlas.ru/clinic/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_content%3Dtoplink%26utm_campaign%3Dtestosterone171016">Atlas</a> decided to rectify the situation and tell how hormones affect each of us - and sometimes in unexpected ways. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e2/8cb/5cc/2e28cb5cc7864789ae469eb8b35312e2.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#807CFF">First about hormones</font> </h2><br>  Hormones are organic signaling molecules that transmit messages within the body and are involved in the regulation of internal processes.  Hormones are secreted by the endocrine system, enter the bloodstream, move with it in the body, reach and activate target cells and thus control the metabolic processes.  Hormones are in many ways similar <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/atlasbiomed/blog/280816/">to neurotransmitters</a> , with the exception that they are fully synthesized inside the body and act not only on nerve cells, but also on other tissues. <br><br>  Hormones are protein, steroid and amino acid derivatives.  Protein hormones dissolve well in water, steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol and, on the contrary, avoid water and dissolve in fat.  Therefore, they are also called lipid (fat) hormones.  To move, steroids need the help of transporter proteins, while hormone-proteins travel independently.

      The synthesis of steroid hormones is regulated by the central nervous system.  The initial impulse, external or internal, enters the brain.  Here the signal is processed and transmitted to the hypothalamus.  He begins to produce pathways (stimulating hormones) or statins (inhibitory).  They act on the pituitary gland, which in turn gives the order to act the thyroid and sex glands and the adrenal glands, which start or stop the production of hormones.  The synthesized hormones enter the blood and activate the processes in the tissues and cells. <br><br>  The hormone reaches the cell it needs and affects its metabolism.  Lipid hormones can even interfere with the process of reading genetic information - to activate or block the work of some genes.  When the task is completed, the hormones are broken down in the cell or, a little later, in the liver. <br><br>  Hormones accompany us most of our lives - affect growth, puberty, hunger and satiety, sexual desire, age-related changes.  The hormonal system interacts with the immune system, regulates metabolism and affects emotions.  In a word, it deserves no less attention than neurotransmitters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2d/0de/b73/e2d0deb73db14c31a46ae35f50f5f254.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#807CFF">Androgenic hormones</font> </h2><br>  Androgens - male sex steroid hormones.  They are present in both men and women, but they influence the formation of the male constitution.  This process begins in the womb - depending on the genes and the chromosome set in the embryo, different types of receptors are activated.  In boys, they will be sensitive to mother's testosterone, in girls - to estrogen.  Genetically incorporated susceptibility to hormones will determine human development. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3085655/">Studies have shown</a> that men and women differ both at a physiological level and in behavioral traits caused by biology.  Not only external sex characteristics, but also the size of internal organs, the peculiarities of the immune system and the structure of the brain depend on sex. <br><br>  In men and women, the sizes of the nuclei of the hypothalamus, the very center of neuroendocrine regulation, which we spoke about two paragraphs ago, differ.  Women, for example, will have a larger core, which regulates the level of luteinizing hormone.  It controls the ovulation process in women and the testosterone level in men.  The process of ovulation is associated with the peak of luteinizing hormone - therefore, this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hypothalamus in women is more. <br><br>  Due to the high level of testosterone, anxiety and depression will be less characteristic of men.  In women, verbal memory is better developed, and in men - spatial and visual thinking. <br><br>  Androgens also stimulate the metabolism - cell renewal, muscle growth, bone strengthening with calcium and trabeculae (the structural components of bone).  In addition, they are responsible for more obvious things - the size of the genitals, the growth of the beard, mustache and hair on the chest, low voice.  With a high level of androgens, these symptoms can also manifest in women. <br><br>  Hormones and their influence on the formation of a person‚Äôs personality are surrounded not only by the professional community, which gave rise to many myths.  Some studies insist that the mother's testosterone levels in the prenatal period affect the development of the fetus, its future behavioral characteristics, and even sexual orientation.  There is even such an indicator as the ratio of the length of the index and ring fingers, which may indicate an increased level of testosterone in the prenatal period and the prevalence of behavioral patterns in the character of "male" behavior, both in men and women.  It should be noted here that the main role in determining and shaping sex is played by genes, on which, in turn, sensitivity to androgens or estrogens will depend. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/005/80a/aa6/00580aaa6cfa40a9aa4d3354ae36213a.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#807CFF">Androstenedione and androstenediol</font> </h2> <br>  Androstenedione is a minor sex hormone that is secreted by the testes in men, by the ovaries in women and, in a small amount, by the adrenal cortex in both sexes.  This is a precursor hormone: in the sex glands in men, it is converted into testosterone, in the ovaries and adipose tissue in women - into estrone (female sex prohormone).  If adipose tissue exceeds the norm, estrogen levels may also increase in men. <br><br>  Androstenedione's activity as an androgenic hormone makes up about 20% of testosterone activity, but plays an important role during puberty. <br><br>  Mostly androstenedione is in the serum in an inactive state.  The concentration of androstenedione increases from the age of seven, but after 30 years of age it begins to decrease gradually.  Analysis of androstenedione is prescribed mainly for women to diagnose hyperandrogenism syndrome - a hormonal disorder in which women have overly pronounced male signs (facial hair grows), and the reproductive system can work poorly.  Elevated values ‚Äã‚Äãof androstenedione suggest features or impairments of steroidogenesis, a lower level indicates adrenal insufficiency or sickle cell anemia. <br><br>  Androstenediol is in many ways similar to androstenedione, with the difference that it precedes not testosterone, but its active form - dehydrotestosterone.  Androstenediol is also synthesized in the adrenal cortex, testes and ovaries.  Elevated levels are associated with hirsutism and acne in women.  A low level of androstenediol in men is associated with hypogonadism, a weakening of the function of the sex glands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/144/5e0/a19/1445e0a19c0a46c8ba1a3bf629c12416.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#807CFF">Testosterone and dehydrotestosterone</font> </h2><br>  The main male sex hormone, testosterone, is a steroid that is mainly produced in the testicles (testicles), hence its name.  It defines habitual androgenic functions - it is responsible for low voice timbre, hair growth on the face and chest, and hair loss on the head (baldness is associated with high testosterone).  In addition, testosterone provides strong bones and muscles, sexual desire, good memory and mood, and what we call "fighting spirit" - energy and readiness for action.  In women, testosterone is produced in the adrenal cortex and is converted into estrogen in the follicles. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4330791/">Studies have shown</a> that testosterone can reduce anxiety and help cope with stress.  Also, high testosterone levels reduce the risk of developing depression in men.  Therefore, older men (with low testosterone levels) have depression more often than younger people.  Even in women, depression is accompanied by lower testosterone levels compared to normal values.  However, in the treatment of depression, androgen replacement therapy showed the same good results as serotonin reuptake inhibitors. <br><br>  Testosterone increases significantly during puberty and remains high until 30 years, then gradually decreases.  In 55-60 years comes the so-called "andropause", and from this point on, traditionally, low testosterone is considered the norm - however, modern specialists are ready to argue with that.  Also, the level of testosterone changes during the day - it will be as high as possible in the morning after waking up and will drop to a minimum in the evening. <br><br>  Within the normal range, testosterone levels increase in response to sexual arousal.  In this case, the rise in the level of the hormone follows the sexual impulse, and does not cause it.  However, a sexual stimulus cannot raise testosterone from very low levels: if the level of the hormone is below normal, no sexual arousal will occur. <br><br>  With reduced testosterone, all its benefits are gradually canceled: muscles and bones weaken, fatigue appears (especially at the end of the day) and you don't want sex.  The attention becomes dull and the mood deteriorates badly - a mature man begins to turn into a grumpy old man.  Together with the fall of testosterone, its ability to burn fat also decreases.  This and less physical activity leads to obesity and overweight.  The excess of adipose tissue does not allow the body to produce a sufficient amount of a protein transporter - sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which is involved in the transfer of testosterone.  In addition, the female hormone estrogen is synthesized in adipose tissue, which promotes the growth of glandular tissue of the mammary glands. <br><br>  High doses of testosterone help build muscle mass and absorb protein from food, so synthetic steroids are a popular means of doping in athletes, especially in heavy weight and bodybuilding.  By the way, using synthetic steroids is a bad idea - not only is it illegal, but also unhealthy: steroids increase the load on the heart, in high doses have many side effects from both the central nervous system and metabolism, and interfere with normal, endogenous synthesis hormones.  In women, steroid hormones form a male physique and disrupt the functioning of the reproductive system - the athletic benefits of androgens in sports are inseparable from such side effects. <br><br>  Testosterone itself is not as active; it only precedes the synthesis of dihydrotestosterone.  This biologically active formula of testosterone and excites receptors of target cells.  Elevated levels of dihydrotestosterone may accompany premature puberty.  Critically low hormone levels decrease libido. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4af/799/d57/4af799d57c9d42088ce0c3cfa74fcbbb.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#807CFF">Replacement Therapy</font> </h2><br>  If manifestations of low testosterone levels bother the patient, the urologist-andrologist or endocrinologist may prescribe a replacement therapy.  The reason for this should be a combination of objective signs (for example, a decrease in the level of testosterone in the blood) and subjective - if the patient is not satisfied with his quality of life, productivity, mood, sexual activity. <br><br>  Replacement therapy with androgens has contraindications and side effects that the doctor must also take into account.  Testosterone is contraindicated for people with thromboses, strokes and heart attacks, as well as a history of gynecomastia and oncological diseases. <br><br>  Testosterone is in the serum most often in an inactive state.  Therefore, in order to prepare the therapy, it is necessary to pass several types of hormone tests.  It will be testosterone free - present in the blood, but not bound to proteins;  total testosterone - attached to transporter proteins;  luteinizing hormone (LH) - it stimulates the cells of the sex glands that produce testosterone;  and prolactin - an increased level of this hormone can reduce the level of LH and, as a result, androgens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/189/c5e/fc0/189c5efc08cd42d8a1e72d65c8c6a8dd.png"><br><br>  A decrease in testosterone levels in older age is a normal story, just as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù as the life expectancy of 45-50 years.  Nature cares about people only for the time of their reproductive activity - the state of health and the quality of their life after 45 years, it does not care much.  But over the past hundred years, life expectancy has increased - and with it, our ideas about when it is time to retire have changed. <br><br>  Therefore, if you want to keep your body and spirit alive, continue doing what you love, or, for example, manage the country, you can choose hormone therapy and help your body to cope with the tasks of the modern world.
