Enjoy reading. </p><br><hr><br><p>  Our studio is considered one of the business veterans.  We created a huge number of universes, and many of them were truly beautiful.  Two even took pride of place in museums, but most are located in private offices or in concert and exhibition halls. <br>  When the main civilization reaches a technological singularity, it begins to fill the universe in an explosive way.  If the parameters are chosen correctly, then this technological Explosion turns into a beautiful four-dimensional image, for which many are willing to pay good money.  However, it is worth a little mistake - the singularity kills them.  It turns out one big "pshik" - and a lot of work on smarka. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zo/ht/v-/zohtv-l_xd_y00u_kivz3ehuuqc.jpeg" alt="KDPV"></p><br><p>  ... <br>  ‚ÄúWhy don't they breed?‚Äù  Only 1.5 children per individual.  With their mortality must be at least 5. <br>  - Yes, sexual desire is weak, we twist it. <br>  - Twist faster, otherwise we cannot test everything else until they want to mate with you.  How many now? <br>  - 0.3 ... <a name="habracut"></a><br>  - crazy?  Make 0.8. <br>  - They will not think about anything else than mating! <br>  - Reduce with age, and all they succeed. <br>  ... <br>  When developing life in the universe, the model of molecular code (DNA) from which the calculator (brain) and its life support (body) is formed is most often used.  This calculator is extremely important.  He creates a singularity and fills the universe.  He is the quintessence of our work.  Everything depends on him. <br>  ... <br>  - Why did he get there? <br>  - Yes, we told the technicians to twist curiosity, so they raised to 0.7.  Scream. <br>  ‚ÄúHe will kill himself ... Oh, I told you.‚Äù <br>  - He is not the first and not the last. <br>  - And the truth - the next climbs!  And how much is enough for them with such parameters? <br>  - I think a maximum of several thousand generations.  They are already half a day entertaining us, even a pity to restart. <br>  - Make me a cast of this time period - show at home, let them have fun.  But seriously, reduce to 0.4 - 0.5, and restart the simulation. <br>  ... <br>  Can you imagine what it means to adjust the behavior of an individual using DNA?  This is about how in billiards, when with one ball you have to drive the second into the pocket.  Only the balls in your chain, say, a thousand.  And while you, by the way, drunk (otherwise it would be too easy).  Modeling such a process is real art.  And we did well in it. <br>  ... <br>  - And how much are they already in this condition? <br>  - Almost a thousand generations. <br>  - And what, only pray?  And nothing more? <br>  - Nothing.  No development.  Yesterday we increased our imagination to 0.86.  Without it, science did not develop at all.  But now they are so vividly aware of the afterlife, that their real life has faded into the background.  All they need is to live to death. <br>  - Gloomy what.  And how much was the imagination before? <br>  - 0.81. <br>  - The change is small, and throws them from one extreme to another.  Look for balance, it is critical here. <br>  ... <br>  By the main civilization usually sit down a few rivals.  These are similar civilizations, but obviously lagging behind in development.  So it turns out to give the necessary impetus for expansion.  Without rivals (when the main civilization reaches a singularity) further growth is very sluggish.  However, the addition of surmountable difficulties turns expansion into a real celebration of life, which we call the Explosion. <br>  ... <br>  - What are they so angry you have become? <br>  - I do not understand.  From a certain stage, they break away from the chain.  No development, some wars. <br>  - Xenophobia touched? <br>  - Let me see ... It looks like someone raised to 0.5.  Most likely, that with rivals do not merge into one big friendly family. <br>  - The explosion is, of course, good, but if they don‚Äôt live to see it, it‚Äôs bad.  Try 0.3. <br>  - 0.3 in this universe will be too small.  Will not light.  Let's try 0.4. <br>  - Try it.  The main thing is not to kill each other. <br>  ... <br>  You can model to infinity, but no model reflects a hundred percent reality.  Only in the real universe can you start the process and see how well we have worked.  Launch and hope that the explosion will be beautiful, as it should be. <br>  ... <br>  - He used the entire arsenal of his skills and technologies. <br>  ‚ÄúWhy then will he not leave her?‚Äù <br>  - Empathy is high, and this is his mother, and she dies. <br>  - And how much more will he do this? <br>  ‚ÄúPerhaps years.‚Äù <br>  - This is a bust. <br>  - But empathy cannot be reduced, we have already tried - mutual aid is falling, communities are falling apart. <br>  - Reduce hope to 0.6.  Maybe it will help. <br>  ... <br>  With this project, everything went wrong from the very beginning.  We took it a few months ago.  The client was a large corporation that planned to use the universe as decoration for one of its conference halls.  The requirements were furious, but we could not help but take it.  These were questions of prestige and reputation. <br>  ... <br>  Chi came to visit us shortly before launch. <br>  - I heard you hand over the project soon? <br>  - So it is: the latest tests and start. <br>  - And when? <br>  - Days after 5 - 7. Initiation 3 billion years before the singularity. <br>  - Too much. <br>  - The development is smoother, fewer surprises. <br>  - 1 - 2 billion seems to be enough.  Are you alright? <br>  - Frankly, the normal parameters could not be adjusted: everything rests on an honest word.  Some had to pick up to 8 - 9 decimal places. <br>  - Come on?.. <br>  - True.  Everything just miraculously does not fall apart in simulations, so we decided to play it safe. <br>  - Sadly.  And show the planet. <br>  - This one, the third from the star. <br>  - Blue? <br>  - Yes she. <br>  - Pretty.  Good luck with the launch.  I hope they succeed. </p><br><p>  <a href="">CC BY-ND</a> </p></div>
