In the comments witty joked that it was time for Google to buy its TLD by <a href="https://habr.com/post/124407/">buying some state</a> .  As a result, Google bought a domain for itself, and also created a registrar. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o-/ti/fj/o-tifjmhsw3ntq7t4syp9krxoig.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  With the change in ICANN policy in 2012, various companies were able to apply for registration of a so-called.  <abbr title="generic top-level domain">gTLD</abbr> (generic top-level domains).  In particular, Yandex took advantage of this, <a href="https://habr.com/company/yandex/blog/180355/">having received</a> approval on <i>.yandex</i> in May 2013 (and having registered <a href="http://nic.yandex/">nic.yandex</a> in August 2013).  Google could not pass by, received the approval of its application for <i>.google</i> and in November 2014 <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/11/26/google_turns_on_google_internet_extension/">earned the</a> first website on this domain nic.google. <br><br>  Separately, I would like to note that Google wanted to get <a href="https://habr.com/post/190424/">domains without a dot</a> from one word, and even developed a ‚Äúnew technical standard‚Äù for this, but the idea did not work.

      After <a href="https://habr.com/post/286250/">buying gTLD <i>.app</i> for $ 25 million</a> , Google planned to launch its own domain name registration service.  And - ta-dam!  - it works! <br><br><h2>  Google registry </h2><br><h3>  Now </h3><br>  At the moment, Charleston Road Registry operates under the Google Registry trademark and offers customers to register a domain name as in one of five publicly available own TLDs (.page, .app, .how, .soy, or. „Åø „Å™ (minna - <i>Jap.</i> "all"), and in one of <a href="https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6010092%3Fhl%3Den">two hundred other TLDs</a> available through <a href="https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6279305">partners</a> . The price of different domains (without premium coefficients) ranges from $ 9 to $ 320. <br><br>  The Google Registry site is available on the traditional domain for registrars <a href="https://nic.google/">nic.google</a> or more official <a href="https://www.registry.google/">www.registry.google</a> . <br><br>  What <a href="https://support.google.com/domains/answer/4632243%3Fhl%3Dru">features</a> does the registrar offer: <br><br><ul><li>  private registration at no additional cost; </li><li>  Forwarding email in your domain </li><li>  simple domain redirection; </li><li>  custom subdomains; </li><li>  using the Google infrastructure of the DNS </li><li>  adding and managing resource records: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, PTR, SPF, SRV, TXT; </li><li>  use of integrated records to integrate with Google App Engine, redirect subdomains and customize G Suite; </li><li>  adding and managing DNS servers; </li><li>  TTL setting, domain lock, etc .; </li><li>  support in chat, by email or by phone. </li></ul><br>  However, there is a big <b>BUT</b> : you must have a <i>billing address</i> in one of the 15 countries that are <a href="https://support.google.com/domains/answer/4639612%3Fhl%3Den">currently supported</a> (Australia, Brazil, Great Britain, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Spain, Italy, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, USA, Thailand, France or Japan). <br><br>  If your country is not on this list, you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/1viF3yadCXSyaw-Vya1nH3eoh26E_0lHs-UPTbu0UnU0/viewform">leave a request</a> to notify you.  However, for many Russian-speaking users, cooperation with Google now may be uninteresting, because they do not register domains .by, .ru and .ua now. <br><br>  "Under the hood," Google Registry has its <a href="https://nomulus.foo/">own Nomulus</a> engine.  On Habr√© there is <a href="https://habr.com/post/313120/">news</a> about the transition of the engine to open source under the Apache 2.0 license.  In short, Nomulus is a Java engine that is tightly integrated into the Google Cloud Platform: it runs on App Engine, and uses Google Cloud Datastore as a database;  this gives it high availability, and easy horizontal scaling. <br><br><h3>  To the future </h3><br>  However, with ‚ÄúCharleston Road Registry‚Äù is not so simple.  In addition to the five public gTLDs listed above, they <a href="https://ntldstats.com/registry/Charleston-Road-Registry-Inc">own another 41st</a> .  In addition to the obvious <i>.google</i> , <i>.goog</i> , <i>.android</i> , <i>.gmail</i> , <i>.hangout</i> , <i>.chrome</i> , <i>.youtube</i> , <i>.nexus</i> , designed to protect the search giant's trademarks, the list includes those related to the core business <i>.ads</i> , <i>.play</i> , <i>.map</i> , as well as very general <i>.meet</i> , <i>.here</i> , <i>.mov</i> , etc.  What will Google do with them?  We do not know the exact plans, but the company gradually gives its reserves to the public. <br><br>  More than three years after winning at the gTLD .app auction, Google <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/05/introducing-app-more-secure-home-for.html">opens,</a> from May 1, 2018, for this domain, registration for everyone.  The key difference of this domain zone is mandatory encryption for all sites, since  TLD <i>.app is</i> listed in the HSTS list for all modern browsers. <br><br>  In September 2017, Google‚Äôs Ben McIlwain <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/09/broadening-hsts-to-secure-more-of-web.html">writes</a> : <br><blockquote>  Internet security is one of the most important characteristics for Google.  Among the security tools, one of the most important is to connect to sites using the HTTPS protocol, which prevents traffic from being intercepted, modified, or redirected during the transfer.  We took a lot of measures to the widespread HTTPS, both within Google and throughout the Internet. <br><br>  We started in 2010 with the translation of connections to Gmail on HTTPS, then we moved to encrypting search results.  In 2014, we encouraged websites to migrate to HTTPS by raising secure sites in search results.  In 2016, we became the platinum sponsor of Let's Encrypt, a service that issued simple and free SSL certificates.  In this (2017) year, we announced that Chrome would show a warning when opening sites without encryption, and we recently added SSL certificate management to App Engine.  And today we are pleased to announce that we will use another component of security tools - HTTPS Strict Transport Security (HSTS) - in a new and noticeable way.  The HSTS list is built into all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer / Edge and Opera), it consists of a list of domain names to which browsers automatically connect via HTTPS.  &lt;...&gt; <br><br>  The HSTS list can contain individual domains, subdomains, or even top-level domains.  &lt;...&gt; In 2015, we launched the first secure domain zone, adding <i>.google</i> to the HSTS list, and now we continue our initiative, adding to the same <i>.foo</i> and <i>.dev</i> . <br><br>  Using HSTS for TLD domain zones allows such zones to be secure by default.  Registration applicants receive guaranteed protection simply by selecting a secure TLD for their website and configuring an SSL certificate without having to add an individual domain or subdomain to the HSTS list.  Moreover, since  Usually, there are months between making an entry on this list and updating browsers for most users, opting for an already protected TLD gives instant protection instead of expected one.  Adding a TLD to this list is also more efficient, since  prescribes a secure connection to all domains of this zone without the need to list them by name. <br><br>  We hope that some of these secure TLDs will open for registration soon, and whether we would like to see each new TLD added to the HSTS list. <br><br>  <b>Clarification 2017-10-06</b> : To dispel some doubts about this text, we would like to state that previously opened TLD registrations (.how, .soy, and. „Åø „Çì „Å™) will not be added to the HSTS list. </blockquote>  On October 2, 2018, Google <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/10/start-new-page-today.html">announces</a> the opening of a <i>.page</i> domain zone for all (from October 9, registration without an additional fee).  The conditions are the same: domain zone in the HSTS list, SSL certificate is required. <br><br>  On October 26, Google will finally <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GoogleDocs/videos/2153484994892810/">use</a> the .new domain zone, but solely for personal interests: you can use a number of domains in this zone as quick access to creating a new document in Google Docs. <br><br><ul><li>  for text file doc.new, docs.new, documents.new </li><li>  for form.new, forms.new </li><li>  for sheet.new, sheets.new, spreadsheet.new table </li><li>  for site.new, sites.new, website.new </li><li>  and for presentation slide.new, slides.new, deck.new, presentation.new </li></ul><br>  On November 12, Google at the Chrome Dev Summit event <a href="https://www.registry.google/announcements/launch-details-for-dev/">announces</a> the opening of domain registration in the <i>.dev</i> zone in 2019.  The dates are: <br><br><ol><li>  January 16‚Äì19.02 Registration for owners of registered trademarks; </li><li>  19‚Äì27.02 ‚Äúearly access‚Äù - registration in several ‚Äúwaves‚Äù for an additional fee; </li><li>  From 28.02 registration for all comers with no extra charge. </li></ol><br>  From the experience of <i>.page</i> it can be assumed that there will be 6 drops in a one-time fee for early registration.  Read more about the new domain zone on the special <a href="https://get.dev/">get.dev</a> page. <br><br>  How much it will be in demand, and how much it will be involved in the long term - we'll see.  The above nTLDStats gives information that 336'064 <i>.app</i> domains are currently <a href="https://ntldstats.com/tld/app">registered</a> , of which 264'551 (or 78.72%) are inactive. <br><br>  The previous experiment with the new TLD <i>.how</i> <a href="https://smallbusiness.googleblog.com/2015/02/introducing-how-new-space-for-learning.html">launched</a> in February 2015 shows that interest in the new domain zone was instantaneous, and then underwent a marked decline.  With 3,470 domains at the peak, 2,196 are currently registered, of which 1,382 (or 62.93%) are inactive.  What can I say, if one of the four domains in the announcement redirects the <i>domain</i> to <i>.com</i> , and three are simply not available. <br><br>  New businesses and teams with new top-level domains have the opportunity to choose a short and memorable name for their presence on the Internet, because it is no secret to anyone that in the domain zones .com, .net and .org has been quite closely for a long time.  And Google continues to form the Internet, in its own way thinking that it will be better for it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430032/">https://habr.com/ru/post/430032/</a></p>
