  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Work in the style of Smart - or why we really love to work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Have you ever heard of an advertising agency that works with several specific areas of business?  If not, then you will definitely be interested to see us.  The highlight of Smart-Media is a segmented approach: its own expert group works with each business line.  Medicine, tourism, education, real estate, finance - experience in each of the areas helps, firstly, to build relationships with customers, and secondly - to approach their business objectives with special attention and knowledge. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you ever really need to visit our office, it will be very easy to do - we were able to settle down almost in the center of Moscow, near the Avtozavodskaya metro station.  We settled in a historic building of the Stalin era from which inherited high ceilings, wide windows and unique chic of that time.  The infrastructure is pumping up a bit, but this is a perfectly acceptable sacrifice.  So, imagine that you went up to the 3rd floor, rang the main door and ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/00b/a64/6d0/00ba646d0504171792a1c40fb8819c91.jpg" height="600"><br><br>  ‚ÄúHello, sit down, do you want coffee or tea?‚Äù Masha, our guardian office, politely asks.  She is a teacher by education, so she easily finds a language with everyone: friendliness and attentiveness are her professional traits. 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      All smartsans have their super abilities: Masha, for example, clever and super-neat.  On her desk, all the markers are arranged in colors, and documents - in the number of pages.  And she owns telekinesis: always know what year it is, day of the week, and what tea will be next week. <br><br>  What, already want to meet her?  Call our office and you will hear her voice. <br><br>  In the meantime, sit down, relax, listen to the life of the office: do you hear someone in the next room talking loudly about the level of involvement?  These are guys from the creative department gathered for morning brainstorming. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6fe/dec/ec1/6fedecec1fc2ab2b18e5ebdda6760d93.jpg" height="600"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ad/80c/718/3ad80c718f921221248de76048aa3473.jpg" height="600"><br><br>  The first half of the day is generally tense.  Here and in the SEO department many guests came running.  Most often they come for advice from neighboring departments, and recently there was another reason to look at the light - to congratulate the department of promotion with the release of the top 3 in the rating of Runet <a href="http://www.ratingruneta.ru/seo/2011/medicine/">www.ratingruneta.ru/seo/2011/medicine</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/356/293/fc7/356293fc77e27707bdb354c2c49980a8.jpg" height="600"><br><br>  Take a look at the social media marketing department.  The guys here are the most unpredictable and funny, so they were separated from the general openspace. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b24/8ed/d38/b248edd38bc9d3fd4619ac562c5171fe.jpg" height="600"><br><br>  Dima is so attached to SMM that he even chooses clothes and all sorts of trifles, not forgetting about his favorite work item. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/859/5d1/a9a/8595d1a9a5eb0c59783f493fe345317f.jpg" height="600"><br><br>  And he is not the only one who is not indifferent to the appearance of the office: the guys from the production love to decorate their places with significant trophies or homemade creativity.  Both that and another cool cheers up, creating the friendly cozy atmosphere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/001/f80/34f/001f8034fde4d3d4a0bf7b74671c1448.jpg" height="600"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f71/059/66d/f7105966d5aab690d0252921c7c3009f.jpg" height="600"><br><br>  We also have our own development department - we are big lovers of non-trivial problem solving, inventing our own tools.  Recently, for example, they launched a program for industry analytics and monitoring of the Runet, which was called ‚ÄúSmart Monitor‚Äù (if you are interested, we will tell about it in detail in one of the following posts). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/61f/f35/d05/61ff35d0513c10773d17b76f57fe650c.jpg" height="600"><br><br>  Camille, apparently decided to celebrate the end of the development of the game in darts.  We wish him to always fall into the "apple"! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/384/925/f29/384925f2925583d8182c145b682975e7.jpg" height="600"><br><br>  The team of telemarketers is always in touch - and even for a couple of photos they could not tear themselves away from telephone conversations.  After all, that did not happen, for them the main thing - to arrange a meeting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50a/1fc/a92/50a1fca92517f9bda64b28cd29ad5898.jpg" height="600"><br><br>  The creative director, unfortunately, did not want to show her face.  Too much work: after all, the creative process, as you probably know firsthand, is largely based on hard work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84a/e39/1d1/84ae391d11e6f4c882231068ac892117.jpg" height="600"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b97/899/0ea/b978990ea9076ea56c579c49a0414809.jpg" height="600"><br><br>  This is Zhenya - our financial director.  Usually she is all in business and in money, and therefore very tired.  But even then she is beautiful, right? <br><br>  Let's now get acquainted with the top management of the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef8/5bf/b17/ef85bfb172b1a15f88724eb603f7f68b.jpg" height="600"><br><br>  Anatoly Zinger is our CEO and just a legendary person.  This is one of the most iconic career ups in the company: when he came to the post of sale, he very quickly headed the entire department, and then - just as swiftly occupied the bridge. <br><br>  And no wonder: he has more than enough talents, and he has decent experience in IT.  Behind shoulders - 4 years of analytics of business processes.  And Anatoly began with the development of CRM systems. <br><br>  In fact, in our office they don‚Äôt like ceremonies, and therefore all employees call their favorite bosses just Tolya.  By the way, recently, everyone sincerely congratulated him on his addition to the family.  And how does he do everything? <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/370/2af/8ae/3702af8ae344df3d97ead77a9023cd4e.jpg" height="600"><br><br>  Constantly keeps the work in good shape and monitors the quality of project management Julia, who is the ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù of our company.  She has been working in the company for more than 4 years and has managed various departments for this term.  It is Julia who will soon talk about building effective business processes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff5/050/4fe/ff50504fe3582444c9dd1698178f0885.jpg" height="600"><br><br>  And this is Mark, our development director.  And this position suits him like no one: he is always in motion, always in development.  It was he who stood at the origin of the company and knows everything about it.  In the future, he will still tell us a lot, but for now let's move on. <br><br>  Several things help us to dilute the saturated labor hours: <br>  One option is a trip to the kitchen: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18c/fcc/2e3/18cfcc2e3f436ea85a88e8e07f4a25fa.jpg" height="600"><br><br>  In a spare minute, everyone pulls into a light blue nook to grab a cup of tea with a bun, jump over a few words with a colleague or ... just have some fun.  Marina (Sale) and Julia (account) are occupied with the last one! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89d/e30/f73/89de30f73bc03578bae103582a392497.jpg" height="600"><br><br>  It is also possible to always avoid the work by visiting a training or a seminar.  The latter, dedicated to personal motivation and sales skills development, was particularly interesting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/545/b31/400/545b314008dd841f99362d88c3cd2c0b.jpg" height="600"><br><br>  Hockey helps us to keep fit and train our reaction.  We even have our own team.  The main beauty is that you do not need to wait for the winter every year to play.  The season is always open. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f31/74b/26e/f3174b26efe359561c0353ce021fd3cf.jpg" height="600"><br><br>  We do not forget about the training of the intellect too: Blokus helps to stir up brains.  Here, as in business, you need to think a few steps forward.  Come play together :) <br><br>  For a long time to distract employees from work with a fun photo session did not work: ‚ÄúMiss April‚Äù woke up and calls everyone to work.  Why is "Miss April"?  Pay attention to the calendar with a beautiful girl: yes, a strict sexual brunette is our Zhenya.  On the last New Year, the girls gathered on their own initiative and made a gift to the whole Smart in the form of a calendar with exclusive pictures.  Enviable yes <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/983/154/38d/98315438dd2785e662ff56b689c7afb8.jpg" height="600"><br><br>  We would love to show something else, but Zhenya is difficult to contradict when she rings her red bell.  Although ... it is generally difficult for her to refuse anything. <br><br>  So that's it.  In the next post we will be more serious - we will start a conversation about SMM.  See you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150763/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150763/</a></p>
