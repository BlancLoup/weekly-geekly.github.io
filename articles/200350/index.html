  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cognitive and MISiS held a school competition</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  Hello, Habr !! </h5><br><br>  NUST "MISiS" together with the company Cognitive Technologies summed up the All-Russian correspondence programming contest among students in grades 9-11.  The Olympiad took place on October 20 and was held according to the ACM ICPC rules.  Its goal was to search for new talents for the subsequent selection in the MISiS team on sports programming.  According to the organizers of the Olympiad, 1871 people took part in it, 191 of them received a participant certificate for success in solving problems.  And the 33 most capable will be invited to the winter programming fees from January 3 to 10, 2014, within which an in-person round of the Olympiad will take place.  It will be in one of the holiday homes in the Moscow region.  Moreover, the organizers will take on the costs associated with accommodation and meals.  His winners, in addition to valuable prizes and get a chance to join the new team of Cognitive Technologies and MISiS programming. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  / <br>  Representatives of the Organizing Committee of the Olympiad reported that the level of the tasks presented was correct, in a sense, optimal.  This, by the way, is not always the case at olympiads.  It happens that one - two tasks turn out to be "dead" - that is, no one could solve them.  This is not good for anyone.  In our case, there was not a single task that participants would not overcome.  On the other hand, the tasks were not simple, because there was not a single person who would solve all the problems.  The best result was seven solved problems. <br>  As a result, Ivanov Mikhail from the Yaroslavl Region (Lyceum No. 2, Rybinsk) and Gramovich Pavel from the Samara Region (Lyceum No. 67, Togliatti) became the winners of the Olympiad.  The second place with 6 solved problems was taken by Nikita Slezkin (School ‚Ññ28 named after AA Surkov) Rybinsk.  Alexander Markelov (City Gymnasium No. 13) of Dimitrovgrad, Ulyanovsk Region, was in the third position. <br>  The competition was attended by cities from all over Russia, as well as schoolchildren from Belarus, who were able to become one of the winners. <br>  It is worth noting such regions as the Yaroslavl Region, the Tambov Region, the Krasnoyarsk Territory, the Ulyanovsk Region and the Samara Region.  These regions showed the greatest activity.  They presented the largest number of participants and showed the best results in solving problems. <br><br>  To verify the decisions of the participants of the Olympiad, an automated verification system was used <a href="https://ejudge.ru/">ejudge.ru</a> .  The testing system made decisions written in programming languages ‚Äã‚ÄãC, C ++, Pascal, Java, Python.  A total of 11 tasks were presented, among which two tasks were relatively simple.  For example: Little Volodya, having only learned to add and multiply, discovered an amazing thing: 2 + 2 = 2 * 2 = 4, but 2 + 3 = 5 is not equal to 2 * 3 = 6. This surprise did not leave Volodya for many years, and now, Being a student of the 10th grade of a school with a mathematical bias, he formulated a generalization of the ‚Äútwo-twos‚Äù property.  He called the set of their N natural numbers correct if the sum of the numbers of this set is equal to their product.  Your task is to find the correct set of a given number of numbers not exceeding 109. <br>  But what the winners write about the Olympiad: ‚ÄúTo begin with, I was late for the Olympiad, about 30 minutes, since I was at the English tutor.  Reaching home, I immediately rushed to the laptop.  Turned it on without even undressing.  Began to solve problems in order.  (Task numbers corresponded to the first letters of the English alphabet).  After task D, I immediately began to read the condition of task H, since its theme is my favorite.  In my opinion, the first three tasks were rather comforting, and I had to think about the others.  In general, all problems were very interesting and solved.  Already at the ‚Äúfinalization‚Äù I was able to do all the tasks, and I was hurt that in the last hour, instead of task J, I began to solve F. Problem J I read already in the last 15 minutes.  I immediately had an idea how to do it.  As it turned out, it was correct and this task on the ‚Äúfinalization‚Äù was completed on my first attempt.

      I would also like to note a very wide geography of topics presented at the Olympiad of problems: both graph theory, dynamic programming, and mathematics, and even geometry.  For this, you (the organizers - author's note) thank you separately, ‚Äùthe winner of the Olympiad Mikhail Ivanov shares his impressions. <br><br>  Pavel Gramovich, who also entered the top three, describes the Olympiad in the following way: ‚ÄúI learned about the Olympiad from my head teacher.  The first 4 puzzles for me were easy enough, then the complexity increased dramatically.  The puzzles were pretty interesting.  I solved 7 tasks, the rest just did not have enough time.  It's my fault.  I misplaced my powers.  I passed the last task 15 minutes before the end.  I am writing only in C ++.  There were difficulties in understanding the formulation of tasks, but I coped with it.  Now I will wait for the organizers to post tasks. ‚Äù <br><br>  We congratulate all the winners!  And I would like the guys who showed high results to come to our university and join the ranks of our sports programming team, which performs well at tournaments of the highest level. <br><br><habracut>  / </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200350/">https://habr.com/ru/post/200350/</a></p>
