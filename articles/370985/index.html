  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IoT - Philosophy of Education</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The development of digital society is inextricably linked with the level of implementation of new technologies in the educational process.  The synergy of innovative solutions and new philosophy in the field of education form the basis of "smart" education (Smart Education).  Using the concept of the Internet of things allows you to make the learning process more interactive, and therefore diverse and interesting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dq/ui/kl/dquiklrsfricdqtwoy10na4xoiu.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Assistant Sensors </h2><br>  Those who follow the development of the Internet of Things (Internet of Things, IoT) - one of the breakthrough trends in IT technology in recent years, no longer perceive the components of its "smart devices" as fashionable toys.  An army of smartphones, sensors, webcams, GPS-navigators and other equipment connected to the network can solve problems in various areas - from production and agriculture, to medicine and everyday life. <br><br>  And if the more well-known "smart" devices such as Smart TV, fitness trackers, or "UAVs" are very far from schools or universities, then there are a number of other, specific IoT devices.  They make the learning process more flexible and lively, allowing the teacher or teacher to receive feedback from each student in a different than traditional form of two-way communication.  At the same time, ‚Äúsmart‚Äù devices do not diminish their role, but rather act as a kind of intelligent assistants.

      With the advent of wireless communications and the IoT concept, it has become possible to transform the familiar attributes of the educational process, such as desks, blackboards and even classes or audiences, into virtual assistants for teachers and students.  Using built-in IoT devices, they are able to capture attention in training and cut off distractions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c0/is/on/c0isonmc9zcagtt4m2defvaflbk.png"><br>  <font color="gray"><i>SynergyNet - integrating multi-touch software in classrooms for collaborative learning.</i></font>  <font color="gray"><i>Photo: SynergyNet</i></font> <br><br>  The capabilities of the IoT concept allow you to program various devices and applications included in the educational IoT platform for specific tasks.  At the same time, they free teachers and teachers from many unusual functions, especially administrative ones, which allows them to devote more time directly to the educational process. <br><br>  Of course, the massive use of IoT devices in the educational sphere is still far away, and even developed countries cannot yet boast of a total digitization of educational institutions.  However, the growing number of devices connected to the Internet, their diversity, as well as the improvement of wireless communications, will certainly contribute to a gradual change in the concept of education, both higher and initial.  And this process is actively going today. <br><br><h2>  ‚ÄúCool‚Äù IoT </h2><br>  Many university teachers, however, like school teachers, complain about a significant loss of time on various organizational issues like marking absentees, checking homework assignments, distributing new ones, etc.  For example, in the US, educational experts estimate that about a third of hours spent at the alma mater spend on various pauses and breaks in classes related to roll calls, issuing and checking assignments, etc., that is, on some minor things , and not to gain knowledge. <br><br>  Automation of individual procedures allows to reduce these losses.  Among the ‚Äúsmart helpers‚Äù who have already taken root in the educational sphere, we note: <br><br><ul><li>  electronic bracelet that allows you to monitor attendance and transmit individual tasks of the student (student); </li><li>  a sensor that attaches to the head and the learner and monitors brain activity; </li><li>  "Smart" desks, electronic boards equipped with a touchscreen; </li><li>  webcams providing online broadcast of lectures and virtual classrooms. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tc/_j/hd/tc_jhdjio-3rsdmkmkih7lrmxso.png"><br>  <font color="gray"><i>Brain activity map.</i></font>  <font color="gray"><i>Picture: Neuroscape Lab</i></font> <br><br>  In addition, various advisory services and decision support systems (DSS) have proven themselves well. <br><br>  So, registration of students or students can be carried out using a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù device, for example, a bracelet using ECG templates for authentication.  Brain activity can be analyzed by a special gadget, working on EEG technology, and determining the costs of the student's cognitive energy.  Information is transmitted to the teacher's device, which determines whether the student is really working on the task, or pretends. <br><br>  With the help of special applications it is quite possible to solve behavioral problems.  We all once studied somewhere and remember how unpleasant it is to get a public ‚Äúbeating‚Äù from a ‚Äúteacher‚Äù, even if it is fair.  Others react to this, and in addition to reputational losses, there is a loss of academic time provided for by the educational process to study a specific topic.  The output can be the use of the ‚Äúsilent messages‚Äù mode, i.e.  the ability to make a remark about the student (student) behavior by sending a vibrating signal to a personal bracelet or messages to the tablet, thus reducing public response and removing possible direct confrontation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2j/xq/xa/2jxqxahapov1i1x4nvy5irmusky.png"><br><br>  Special software will be able to analyze the behavioral dynamics of a particular student or student during the period of study and to compile his personal image, which will be very useful both for beginning teachers and those unfamiliar with a certain audience.  Of course, with today's concept of teaching, such methods in the ‚Äústudent-teacher‚Äù relationship may seem of little use, but when our life becomes more ‚Äúdigital,‚Äù they will be completely appropriate and applicable. <br><br>  As a result, taking the secondary issues to the background with the help of IoT technology, the teacher will no longer perform the functions of an administrator and will be able to devote more time to working directly with students. <br><br><h2>  Learn to survive </h2><br>  Of course, the full potential of IoT today can be used by educational institutions in countries with modern wireless infrastructure and appropriate financing.  But gradually this tendency will prevail and dictate the demand for a new philosophy of education. <br><br>  As economic processes in developed industrial countries show, there is always a demand for new knowledge and forms to get it.  Today's business can be done by people with high creativity, quick decision-making, able to work in a team, and, naturally, technically prepared.  However, they must constantly learn in accordance with the changing range of tasks.  Thus, modern education is already considered as an investment, an asset, the formation and capitalization of which must be managed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g-/gl/zi/g-glzixicylsl2q_nwnjwqcxfi8.png"><br><br>  It is quite possible to achieve this by using solutions provided by the concept of the Internet of Things.  NTR has changed and continues to change the ways of transferring, receiving and fixing knowledge, as well as the formation of new skills.  A person, through interaction with ‚Äúsmart‚Äù devices, gets an opportunity to control his intellectual development practically throughout his life. <br><br>  But to discard the importance of participation in this process by the teacher and the teacher would be wrong.  Today's achievements in –ÜT do not diminish their role, and at the same time they demand to correspond to the trends of the times.  Digital literacy will very soon become one of the working conditions in the field of education, however, as in others.  But since the digital revolution in society largely depends on the level of technical literacy of citizens, the mission of the teacher in this process is still significant. <br><br><h2>  Social learning </h2><br>  Yet, the technical component of Smart Education itself, despite all its importance, will not bring the expected breakthrough.  The new philosophy of "digital learning" will involve many of its forms.  As mentioned above, to be in demand, a person must constantly improve their professional skills and knowledge after graduation.  And in this context, one of the solutions is the formation of communities in the form of social platforms, where people will be united by common interests, in particular, the desire to self-educate and share experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e0/5f/7v/e05f7v4ezszq_5jsxyrjbgcdju8.png"><br><br>  Of course, there are still many such professional resources.  But the mass introduction of the capabilities of the Internet of Things into the learning processes will contribute to uniting into the global system not only those who teach or want to gain knowledge, but also the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù devices involved in this process.  Thus, a new social IoT platform will be formed - SIoT, based on the harmonious synergy of the three components: social, content and hardware.  Due to this unity, it is possible to model a huge number of different options for obtaining and sharing knowledge, both academic and professional. <br><br>  As you can see, Smart Education on the SIoT platform is a kind of fantastic space where the technical, educational and social aspects of modern human life will harmoniously connect.  Experimenting with the capabilities of IoT, everyone can quite "pump" their abilities, ranging from personal to professional. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370985/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370985/</a></p>
