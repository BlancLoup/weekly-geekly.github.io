However, not everyone pays due attention to this.  Thus, in the UK every third financial service is not properly protected, and some even prefer not to prevent financial fraud, but only to correct its consequences. <br><br>  Despite the increase in the turnover of online financial transactions, about 33% of financial services do not provide secure payment network channels for customers.  According to a <a href="http://www.cbronline.com/news/cybersecurity/business/online-payments-at-risk-as-banks-fail-to-secure-transactions-4703590">study</a> conducted by Kaspersky Lab and B2B International, some banks and payment companies face difficulties in trying to fully protect themselves and their clients from financial fraud.  About 65% of the surveyed representatives of the banking and payment sector complained that their customers made financial transactions through various devices, but only 53% use two-factor authorization. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Only 50% of respondents provide their customers with a specialized solution for monitoring real-time fraudulent transactions (antifraud), despite the fact that at the moment it is one of the most effective tools in the field of security.  42% of study participants stated that they provide a specialized antifraud solution for user devices, and 67% say they have implemented a secure connection for all types of online payments. However, instead of getting rid of risks, only 48% of respondents said they are trying reduce them, while 29% said it was cheaper for them to correct the consequences of financial fraud than to prevent incidents. <br><br>  Most respondents preferred specialized solutions to general Internet security services to prevent disguised phishing attacks and malicious emails that lead to loss of funds.

      The financial sector has always been the main target of hackers, and recently the National Crime Agency of the United Kingdom called on citizens to protect themselves from cyber attacks after attackers stole about ¬£ 20 million from British bank accounts. <br><br>  Kirill Slavin, head of the Kaspersky Lab department in the UK and Ireland, says: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThis study shows that banks and payment organizations find it difficult to manage online fraud in the modern multi-channel world.  38% of the organizations with whom we spoke recognized that it is becoming more and more difficult to determine whether the transaction is fraudulent or user.  Unfortunately, more than a third of those polled answered the question about the measures taken to protect them, ‚Äúwe will cope with problems as they are received.  Taking into account the results of our study, in which we identified 22.9 million financial malicious attacks in 2014, affecting the interests of 2.7 million clients around the world, it becomes clear that dealing with each incident is not the most viable long-term solution. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  <i>If you need a reliable and secure payment solution for your business, <a href="http://payonline.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dwebpayments-main">please contact us</a> , we will select the appropriate package depending on the needs and specifics of your company.</i>  <i>PayOnline is the official payment service provider of Visa and MasterCard and is certified by PCI DSS Level 1.
