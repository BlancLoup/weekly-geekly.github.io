Becoming in essence the "flagship" of the free placement of streaming video for public viewing, the only ones to whom it brought in revenue were its creators who received <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/company/google/">Google</a> Network Monster shares. <br><br>  YouTube has not yet given tangible benefits to its new owner, who has just recently become a ‚Äúfull-fledged‚Äù.  Sergey Brin's subordinates have written quite good recommendations for Google Adsense participants - and now the world knows that the background of the contextual ad unit should be combined with the background of the page.  But the world does not know where the ad units on YouTube should be. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  However, Google is not a company that will give its shares: whether you are even Bill Gates or <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/1322/">Terry Camel</a> , you have to give Google something that brings money.  The strategy chosen by the company for public relations of its not cheap purchase, while it seems quite successful.

      No one, in principle, had any doubt that the numerous claims from the right holders would attract close media attention.  YouTube is in the spotlight.  Media holdings, sports clubs and all-all-all, who are hoping for a profitable cooperation with Google in terms of placing their video, rushed to distribute the statements, hinting at possible lawsuits. <br><br>  It would seem - here it is, the money trap, which many analysts predicted to hit Sergey Brin: everyone believed that the losses from these claims would block all future advertising revenues from YouTube many times.  Google signs contracts with everyone who says, ‚ÄúI saw clips with my image on your service!‚Äù And analysts are rubbing their hands again: this is the way to ruin! <br><br>  But November 21 comes, and CBS representatives <a href="http://mashable.com/2006/11/21/the-youtube-effect-cbs-gets-massive-boost/">say</a> that the growth of their show ratings has grown thanks to YouTube!  A month has passed since the <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/lenta/1377/">conclusion of an agreement</a> between YouTube and CBS (Viacom): the parties agreed that excerpts from the shows of this TV channel can be freely posted without any claims to users.  And now CBS and YouTube have said in a joint statement that over the past month, television show ratings have grown by about 5%;  CBS believes that this is largely due to the most popular video hosting. <br><br>  Of course, the key word here is ‚Äúbelieve.‚Äù  It is strange to hear such words from one of the world's largest media holdings, but they only ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù.  At the same time, such a company would not be groundlessly making such statements; consequently, there are certain agreements between Google and CBS that have brought something - or will bring to the parties. <br><br>  Save TV with YouTube - you can.  Apparently, both CBS and the <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/lenta/1556/comments/">National Hockey League</a> believe in this.  And we can also believe that the ratings of the TV show have increased thanks to YouTube: after all, someone did not watch them before, someone remembered ... Although it is difficult to imagine that 200,000 new viewers suddenly rushed from the monitor screens to their sofas with popcorn. <br><br>  But CBS believes.  Apparently, he believes that it will be possible to post his shows on YouTube by inserting advertising blocks into them - and returning to the American Internet users the habit of watching The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.  And Google believes that it will definitely be able to earn on its largest acquisition this year.  After all, if such a PR goes on and on, then soon both CNN, and the BBC, and Konstantin Ernst will believe that it is better to post their programs on the Internet.  And there will be a new TV channel Google TV, which will be broadcast via the Internet all the best shows of the world.  And if now ‚ÄúChannel One‚Äù, together with the rest of the Russian TV companies, is <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2006/11/20/quarter/">losing its audience</a> due to the fact that more and more providers in Russia provide unlimited high-speed Internet access, then who knows: maybe in 5 years we can write everything we think about Petrosyan and Malakhov, in their comments ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4711/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4711/</a></p>
