Sometimes it just looks like magic, as they make windows move, images appear, applications run and do many other cool things - while their fingers don't seem to leave the keyboard at all. I can't boast of knowing many of Mac's tips and tricks, however I have some tips in stock that you may find helpful.  Some of them are fairly common, some are not so well known, but they all do something important, bringing you closer to the rank of Jedi Master of your Mac.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Yes, Padawan, here are my 10 top tips Mac OS X: <br><br>  1. Shift + Click the Maximize button to fill the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/64f/48c/14c/64f48c14cfe8a32422f4c305944c9088.png"><br><br>  You know that the red button closes the window, the yellow button minimizes and the green button maximizes, right?  Well, you also know that some applications (such as Chrome and Word) do not fill the entire screen when you click the maximize button.  I'm sure this is fine most of the time, but sometimes you want the window to open full screen.  The next time you want to expand the current window to full screen, just hold down the Shift key while pressing a button.  Here!  Big window! <br><br>  2. Application tips Terminal - purge (cleaning) <br><br>  One of the most important tools in the set of Jedi Mac - Terminal.  About Terminal, what power do you have over the whole system.  Many people are very unsure of using Terminal.  All these scary stories of those who write rm * in the wrong places and wipe out the whole Mac, have the proper effect on people.  Yes, it looks believable, but there is a simple team that is ... pretty cool!  The command is called purge (cleaning) performs a fairly simple operation - frees up the RAM of your computer.  When your Mac is working and you are launching applications, surfing the net and doing normal business on your Mac, RAM (memory) is involved.  Sometimes, when an application is running for a while, it does not free up all the RAM memory provided, even if it is no longer required.  Before I learned this method, I simply rebooted my Mac if the memory ran out (and I closed all applications I didn‚Äôt use), but along with the purge ... Purge forces applications to free up RAM that they can consume (and which they don‚Äôt need) .  All you need is to run Terminal from the Utilities folder, write ‚Äúpurge‚Äù (without quotes) into the string and press enter.  It is 100% safe and can free up a lot of memory.  I got a few megabytes - a few gigabytes in seconds!  (Important: when the cleaning is running, your Mac will not react for about a minute. Do not worry! This is normal!) <br><br>  3. Start Spotlight by pressing CTRL-Spacebar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b45/f7d/77d/b45f7d77d14ebcc2e0b2e36865b17cdb.png"><br><br>  Looking for something?  You know that Spotlight can help you quickly find files, email, check words, even launch applications ... But did you know that a quick press of the Command-space bar will open Spotlight in the menu bar for you to start typing?  It's simple, because you can quickly press CTRL-Space and then type something like safari, press enter and run Safari ... and your fingers will not even touch the mouse!  Want to make it the eleventh council?  Then just download the free Alfred app from the Mac App store and use all this and more!  Once downloaded, don‚Äôt forget my 10 Great Alfred Tips! <br><br>  4. Drag and drop files into the toolbar and open them in the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e5b/e23/3a1/e5be233a16c09c6af13b77cf0233d1e0.png"><br><br>  I like to use Preview as the default application for opening images.  The preview works quite quickly and easily when I need to take a quick look at something (or quickly change the image size), but if I want to edit an image, I use Acorn.  So, how do I open an image in Acorn?  You are thinking to start Acorn, open the File menu ... No, it's easier.  Acorn is always on the toolbar, so all you need is to drag the image file onto the icon and ... Acorn will start (or come to the fore) and the image will be open!  This trick works with almost all applications and can save you a ton of time. <br><br>  5. Separate App Stack for Applications <br><br><img src="http://img684.imageshack.us/img684/9316/33960125.png"><br><br>  My dock began to sink into the mess.  A lot of applications that are ‚Äúneeded‚Äù, but which I didn‚Äôt use so often.  Therefore, I made for them a separate App Stack.  This process consists of several steps: <br>  Create a folder somewhere (I created it in ~ / Applications, which is different from the System-wide Applications folder (see tip 7 for all of these directories) <br>  Open your Applications folder in another Finder file manager window. <br>  At this stage you are going to create shortcuts for your real applications.  Hold the command and option and drag the application to which you need quick access to the created folder. <br>  Repeat the action for any number of applications as desired. <br>  Drag the folder with all applications on the right side of your toolbar, to the left of the basket. <br>  Enjoy!  Everything is ready, the folder will contain the labels of all your applications! <br><br>  6. Removing Icons from the Menu <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/773/a2a/aa2/773a2aaa224e6172b6f038bc38ff5f23.png"><br><br>  I know it's nice to see icons in our menu, but sometimes it gets a little overloaded.  For some icons in our menu (most often related to the system ones), just hold the Command, click on the icon and drag it from the menu!  Try it, you don't need the speaker volume icon, right? <br><br>  7. Access to the Library folder <br><br>  Thanks to one of the ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù in Lion, the Library folder was hidden from you.  OK, I get it.  You do not need to dig into your library too often, but sometimes you do.  Sometimes you need to clean up stubborn files or something like that.  Here is an easy way to access the Library folder (as well as the Applications folder from step 5).  With Finder enabled, click Command-Shift-G and the Go to folder window will open.  Just type ‚Äú~ / Library /‚Äù (without quotes) and click OK.  Done!  To go to applications, type ~ / Applications /. <br><br>  8. Sidebar Finder <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e99/af8/522/e99af852269cbeac07ffd008e2aa39b4.png"><br><br>  As we are talking about the file manager, I‚Äôm sure you noticed all these folders and sections on the left side of your Finder windows (if not, go to Finder and on the View menu select ‚ÄúShow Toolbar‚Äù).  You know that you can add your own folders there, right?  Yes, just drag any folders to the side and you're done.  Now you do not just have access to this folder in one click, but everything you drag will be copied or moved to it!  Not bad! <br><br>  9. Take a screenshot <br><br>  Ever come across the need to take a screenshot of what is on your screen now?  This can be either a mistake or just a schedule, and you need it ... but how?  Simply.  Command-Shift-3 saves an image of the entire screen, and command-shift-4 allows you to select a portion of the screen or window.  Of course, if you want to get more advanced features, download Skitch for free and diversify your screenshots with different notes. <br><br>  10. Monitor applications that load at startup. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6be/680/ad0/6be680ad051d5483d30b225ac2511997.png"><br><br>  You've noticed that over time, your Mac runs longer and longer.  At first you see the desktop, but then the applications start to zagrzhatsya one by one.  You can manage this process.  Just go to System Preferences -&gt; Users and Groups.  Then find the Login Items button.  Yes, these are all applications that run for me.  But if I‚Äôm tired of waiting for this or that application to load, I‚Äôll just select it in the list and click ‚Äú-‚Äú.  Done!  I achieved a faster launch! <br><br>  These are just some of the tricks hidden in my sleeve.  I am sure that over the years you have also learned a few, so ... <br><br>  What are your favorite OS X tricks?  Tell about them in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151416/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151416/</a></p>
