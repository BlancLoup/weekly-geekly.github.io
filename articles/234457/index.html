But there is one subtle place in it ... <br><br>  GTD requires you to put everything in your inbox: thoughts, contacts, business, etc. ... People write down something more or less important, and they keep small things and information in mind.  This is where the problems begin. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Why are people lazy to write everything down?</b>

      Most often this is not laziness, but simply uncomfortable tools.  After all, what is usually used as an inbox?  Either a smartphone or a small notebook. <br><br>  However, sometimes it is inconvenient: <br><br><ul><li>  You are driving.  A valuable thought comes to mind that you should write down.  But what can you do?  Do you really stop because of this? </li><li>  Winter, frost minus 30. You walk down the street.  Again you need to write something down.  Will you get a smartphone?  Yes, he may not even react to pressing ice fingers!  Run to look for a warm shop? </li><li>  Or you are a writer and some ‚Äúingenious‚Äù lines occurred to you.  Where to put it all, if you're not at the computer?  But such insights often happen away from the workplace.  You get a notebook and start writing on your knee? </li></ul><br><br>  Of course, here you start to "be lazy"! <br><br>  With a voice recorder, all these situations are solved simply: <br><ul><li>  Behind the wheel, you can easily dictate anything without being distracted from the road - your eyes are not needed! </li><li>  In the cold you can dictate through a mitten.  Checked - the sound quality does not suffer. </li><li>  Long sentences?  You dictate them in 5 seconds! </li></ul><br><br>  Why do many, even knowing about the recorder, refuse to use it? <br><br>  <b>Objection number 1.</b>  <b>Why do I need a separate device?</b>  <b>There is a smartphone!</b> <br><br>  To use a smartphone you need two hands and eyes.  Dictaphone requires only one hand. <br><br>  No other voice recorder application comes close to convenience with the simplest voice recorder.  I refer you to the article I wrote here, on Habrahabr: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/215075/">‚ÄúSmartphone or voice recorder: which is more convenient?‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  I wrote about my tape recorder, all its ‚Äúchips‚Äù <a href="http://n-man.ru/diktofon-kak-chast-menya/">here</a> .  Inexpensive, but very convenient.  However, I did not have other dictaphones)) <br><br>  <b>Objection number 2.</b>  <b>Dictaphone - an extra mediator</b> <br><br>  Additional barrier.  You enter the job as if twice.  Once in the recorder, and the second time - already in the system. <br><br>  What to answer to this? <br><br>  You are not required to use the voice recorder as the only inbox.  You can use it when it is more convenient.  I, for example, 90% of the tasks go to the voice recorder, and the remaining 10% are divided between the smartphone and the computer.  You may have 20% -40% -20%, for example. <br><br>  <b>Objection number 3</b>  <b>"I feel awkward"</b> <br><br>  Yes, there is such a moment.  When you just start walking with a dictaphone, you feel uncomfortable.  A sort of Stirlitz)) But isn't it just cockroaches in our head?  I think people are already accustomed to all kinds of devices: wireless headphones, fitness bracelets, smart glasses and watches.  Voice recorder few people surprised.  Yes, and get used to others ... gradually. <br><br>  These were objections, let's move on to the benefits. <br><br>  <b>Advantage # 1.</b>  <b>Deep problem statement</b> <br><br>  Now you can not just abbreviate, somehow, ‚Äúscratch‚Äù the task.  With a voice recorder, you can add detailed comments, some accompanying thoughts.  You can even sing a melody or portray some kind of emotion)) <br><br>  <b>Advantage number 2.</b>  <b>Easy task entry</b> <br><br>  Voice recorder is the easiest way to set a task.  It‚Äôs just like breathing in and out.  Hands are occupied, it is dark, you are in a hurry somewhere - all this is not an obstacle to get a tape recorder. <br><br>  <b>Advantage number 3.</b>  <b>Easy audio capture</b> <br><br>  Sit in a meeting and some important discussion began?  You can simply turn on the recorder.  And no need to scribble notes at a frantic pace, confused and puffing.  It's comfortable. <br><br>  Or, for example, you will be able to ‚Äúshoot‚Äù the girl you liked on the run.  Ask her to dictate your number.  It makes an interesting impression on girls.  Now she will not forget you for sure)) <br><br>  <b>Advantage # 4.</b>  <b>Comfortable work on the go</b> <br><br>  With the advent of the voice recorder, I discovered the work on the go: <br><ul><li>  I can dictate the article on the go.  For example, this article was dictated. </li><li>  I can on the go to arrange a real brainstorming of a complex task or project.  It happens, I go out on a bike path, shove earplugs in my ears and go!  Very creative furnishings ... </li></ul><br><br>  Work on the go, I introduced deliberately, to slightly dilute the sit.  Just a day it turns out to work like this for 1-2 hours on average <br><br>  <b>Advantage number 5.</b>  <b>Comfortable work with a personal assistant.</b> <br><br>  I am writing purely theoretically, because I have never had a personal assistant. <br><br>  It seems to me that such a ‚ÄúVoice Recorder + Personal Assistant‚Äù scheme will be convenient for many managers or just people who can afford it. <br><br>  You send notes recorded for the day and tasks to the assistant.  And he decrypts them and digitizes (makes to the scheduler, to Evernote, to Google Contacts, etc ..).  Isn't it great? <br><br>  It is a pity that my current voice recorder is inconvenient for this.  I wish the voice recorder could send their recordings to the cloud via Wi-Fi.  Now you have to connect the cable - inconvenient. <br><br>  <b>When to decipher all this?</b> <br><br>  Yes, all this will have to be decrypted sooner or later.  I do this in the morning when I plan my day, do an inspection of the entire task tree, etc ... I take a tape recorder and start recording and recording, listen to it.  Something flies to the scheduler.  Something in Evernote.  Something in Google Contacts and so on. <br><br>  Working with a voice recorder rarely takes more than 3-5 minutes.  Is it a lot? <br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br><br>  Few of us can boast that he has rooted in an office chair and never leaves the computer.  For everyone else, in my opinion, the voice recorder is the perfect inbox in GTD.  Only then I was able to instill in myself GTD, when I got a voice recorder. <br><br>  And how do you work with the ‚ÄúInbox‚Äù folder in such cases (driving, frost, on the run)? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234457/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234457/</a></p>
