I repeat that in the US there are a lot of free magistrates at STEM, you just need to carefully study the sites of universities of interest.  There are <b>very</b> few wishing Americans to go to an IT school in the United States, because the alternative cost of their time is too high - you can immediately go to work for big money.  In addition, the majority of American Computer Science bachelor has $ 50-100k in debt - no one wants to live in debt.

      In the summer, a year before the release, you need to start training.  The later you start - the harder it is to achieve results. <br><br><h4>  2. Make a crooked summary. </h4><br>  Nobody demands a genius, but the crooked one will immediately fly away to the shepherd's stove, never having seen real engineers.  Therefore, a resume is very important, and should be good enough.  The rules are simple: no typos, literate English (ask a familiar [native speaker] to check your Google translation sucks, believe me, some terms are almost impossible to translate - you need to use English analogs) and one page length for 5 years of experience, or better just one page - select the main thing.  <a href="http://www.careercup.com/resume">More information about resumes can be found at CareerCup</a> . <br><br><h4>  3. Find a referral </h4><br>  In principle, this is an optional step, but I decided to single it out as a separate item, because I never hear anything said about him.  It turns out that finding a referral (an invitation through the internal system from an engineer working for the company) is an incredibly useful option.  No, it does not give a guaranteed invitation to work - just (more likely) an invitation to those.  interview, however, this step, in the experience of my and my colleagues, is the most difficult step in the whole process. <br><br><h4>  4. Prepare for the interview. </h4><br>  This is a crucial step.  For example, it is always hard for me to prepare for anything ‚Äî it seems to me that I am ‚Äúalready clever enough‚Äù ‚Äîbut this is a serious mistake, you need to prepare yourself if you are smart, just in the alternative case, you don‚Äôt need it, nothing will not work. <br><br>  Now, about how to prepare and what.  In large IT companies, market leaders, interviews are about the same - you are expected to have knowledge of fundamental algorithms and data structures, nothing more. <br><br>  Training is conveniently divided into two parts: fundamental knowledge and practical tasks. <br><br>  For the first, the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI">Sedgwick</a> course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI">on Coursera</a> is best suited.  The first and second parts of the lectures can be found on the rutracker, but the first is much more interesting and useful.  Pay special attention to trees - you need to be able to write a normal algorithm on the board for any action with any simple tree, for example: ‚Äúfind the median in the binary search tree‚Äù.  I did not hear that they asked about self-balancing trees - so this is just for development, especially since Sedgwik himself Red-Black Trees Self-Balancing Left-Leaning and came up with it. <br><br>  I'm not a big fan of IT books.  To say more precisely - I can not stand them.  But for practical preparation for the interview I strongly recommend the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1452987664%26sr%3D1-1%26keywords%3Dhow%2Bto%2Bcrack%2Bthe%2Bcoding%2Binterview">Cracking the Coding Interview</a> by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.  Among my friends, everyone who used this book got an offer, no one who used it would get it.  N, however, in this sample is about 10. In general, just buy this book, and solve all 169 problems.  I got one straight from the book (although I missed it - and in vain). <br><br><h4>  5. Do not merge into an interview and sign an offer. </h4><br>  If you received an invitation to those.  interview - it's in the bag!  First there will be a telephone, with an engineer, 45-60 minutes;  Code in Google or another online notepad.  Here, of course, may not be lucky, but in general, nothing complicated.  Tasks as in the book. <br><br>  After that, if all is well, they are invited to the campus, paying all associated costs.  There are 4-6 of those.  interviews with different engineers of different levels.  The interview is exactly the same as the telephone one, only on the board, although it all depends on the person - one asked me to write on his laptop.  Their feedback goes to the commission, which makes the decision. <br><br>  If you all really liked - get and sign an offer.  If you liked it, but not very well - options are possible.  Sometimes they do additional interviews, sometimes they ask for a letter of recommendation.  I was offered a transitional position in Engineering Residency, to which, after one more of those.  interview, I signed an offer. <br><br>  Successes! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297920/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297920/</a></p>
