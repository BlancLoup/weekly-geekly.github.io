  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Telepathic payments, writing to an elephant wash and other test tasks for UX editors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Once upon a time, when I was engaged in web development more than with texts, every six months I definitely looked at vacancies: who are looking for and what they want.  Even if she was not going to change her work at all - just to be aware of the requirements and technologies.  And sometimes I even did test ones - to check what I can, what I can't, and what it costs to pull up.  And one day I almost accidentally stumbled upon a wonderful test task: ‚ÄúImagine that Yandex.Money began to accept payments with socks.  Write the text for the banner to the main page and the letter for the partners. ‚Äù </p><br><p>  The first reaction: "Ha-ha, who comes up with such test ones, and most importantly, who makes them."  Three hours later, I re-read all the newsletters, banners and articles from Yandex.Money that I found in the public domain, and I knew everything about socks: what are they made of, how many people are on Earth, how are men different from women?  And most importantly, in front of me lay ready test - I had to send.  So began my journey into the universe of interface texts.  And at the same time - work in Yandex. Money. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ad/qc/or/adqcorvo6vvp40v33vji3xjn3to.png"></p><br><p>  In this article I will talk about how we come up with test ones and give a couple of examples.  And a little more about our hard editorial work, otherwise it will be unclear. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="zachem-redaktoru-testovoe-zadanie">  Why does the editor need a test task? </h2><br><p>  Indeed, why?  After all, we usually do not take absolutely newbies, and a person with work experience can ask for a portfolio, evaluate skills - and go ahead.  Backenders have a link to a githab, front examples are examples of scripts, and the editor has a couple of articles. </p><br><p>  Unfortunately, there are not so many people who are specially engaged in texts for interfaces.  Even fewer of those who not only fixes errors and put commas in what developers wrote, but how we work on the project from the very beginning, together with the UX-designer and the product team (I really want to tell you more about it, but this is the topic for a separate article).  If the person at the interview says that he invented the names for the buttons in the mobile application or helped to make a couple of complex forms on the site, the Yandex.Money editors may even dance a little on the table - for joy. </p><br><p>  <em>‚ÄúHey, when will there be elephants and telepathy?‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Be patient a little, elephants bathe.</em>  <em>Telepathic module customize.</em>  <em>All will be :)</em> </p><br><p>  When we are looking for a new editor in our funny text band, we do not expect to find a ready-made one who will sit down and immediately write everything to us.  We are looking for a person who will be interested with us and whom we will be able to teach everything more or less quickly. </p><br><p>  The test task is an ideal way to see how a person reasons, what he considers important, what he pays attention to and what questions he asks.  And at the same time - to evaluate literacy and the ability to ‚Äúget into style‚Äù (but these are already quite standard requirements for the editor). </p><br><h2 id="kak-my-eto-pridumyvaem">  How do we come up with it </h2><br><p>  <em>This section is sponsored by the Yandex.Money project office.</em>  <em>Taking this opportunity, we say hello to all project managers, and especially ...</em> </p><br><p>  At the very beginning I told about the test, for which I ‚Äúcaught‚Äù myself - about payment by socks.  Repeating it here is not so interesting, so here is similar in essence, but with a different entourage. </p><br><h3 id="zadanie-1-nemnogo-telepatii">  Task 1. Some Telepathy </h3><br><blockquote>  Imagine that you received from the project manager a description of a new service and an order for texts.  You need to come up with a name and description for users and slogans for the banner (3 options, up to 40 characters). <br><br>  Project justification: we want to give Yandex.Money users the opportunity to pay anytime, anywhere, without special equipment or devices. <br><br>  Solution: we will implant a special chip into the user's brain, which sends the payment order via telepathic channels to the Yandex.Money server. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Known issues: <br>  - the risk of accidental operation (for example, in a dream or in a state of intoxication), <br>  - the high cost of the chip itself, as well as the operation of its implantation or replacement, <br>  - inability to pay in certain categories of stores. <br><br>  Limitations: <br>  - for successful payment it is necessary that after payment in the user's wallet there remains an amount not less than 17% higher than the amount of the operation itself, <br>  - at the time of payment, the user must be focused and calm, otherwise there may be errors in the quantity of goods or delivery address, <br>  - the chip can be implanted only in two specialized clinics (in Moscow and St. Petersburg). <br></blockquote><p>  People who get it are often addicted to entourage: they insert esoteric terms anywhere, invent a telepathic robot, or even invent the language of the future.  But they forget about quite serious product limitations described in the task. </p><br><p>  Try to replace telepathy with payments from the wallet, and the implantation of the chip to identification.  The problem will immediately become ‚Äúcloser to life‚Äù (at least to ours). </p><br><p>  When we come up with such tasks, we add to them the conditions that we meet every day.  And we look at how the applicants will take them into account and process what they understand and what questions they will ask. </p><br><h2 id="pochemu-zadaniy-neskolko-i-chem-oni-otlichayutsya">  Why several tasks and how they differ </h2><br><h3 id="zadanie-2-koe-chto-o-myte-slonov">  Task 2. Something about washing elephants </h3><br><blockquote>  This is the form that will allow you to pay for washing the elephant.  Here are the conditions: <br>  - you can wash the elephant right after the payment, <br>  - after payment to the specified phone the manager of the elephant wash will call you back, <br>  - full wash of an elephant costs 2000 rubles, <br>  - only hind legs - 1000 rubles, <br>  - only ears and tail - 700 rubles, <br>  - you can use the balm after washing - plus 900 rubles, <br>  - we also have an elephant manicure (but this is a separate payment form on another page). <br><br>  Payment forms for example: <br>  https://money.yandex.ru/taxes <br>  https://money.yandex.ru/shop/4217 <br></blockquote><p>  We have a lot of different services and different formats for which you need to write texts.  Forms of payment, the process of payment, mobile applications to pay for everything in the world or something specific, payment solutions for business.  All this is accompanied by newsletters, banners, landing pages, explanatory texts, hints, errors, and rather large help texts. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_w/lx/ty/_wlxty-p4jjyus2ijejj4pq5bum.png"></p><br><p>  It is important for us to see how a person copes with different things, so in the test task there are always several small tasks (usually three). </p><br><p>  Form is a simple way to check what a person knows about interfaces.  He will think about what is convenient, as he calls the buttons, whether the labels will align with the margins of the margins or not, what clues and errors will show the user. </p><br><p>  When designing a form for writing on an elephant bed, they usually try to come up with a ‚Äúselling slogan‚Äù - and they write about pure elephants, great happiness and care for pets.  Although the problem is not the point.  It is better to offer to recalculate the amount when choosing different options and explain to the user why we ask the phone. </p><br><h2 id="pochemu-zadaniya-inogda-ne-sovsem-ponyatnye-i-dazhe-protivorechivye">  Why tasks sometimes not quite clear and even contradictory </h2><br><p>  Because everything is as in life: tasks are set by different people, there may be contradictions and not very clear formulations.  When you get a puzzle, it is important not just to do it, but first to understand what is wanted of you, but to ask about the incomprehensible. </p><br><h3 id="zadanie-3-zebry-i-bizony">  Task 3. Zebras and Bison </h3><br><blockquote>  Yandex.Money opens a new service, the internal name is ‚ÄúZebrovnik‚Äù.  The service will allow visitors to look at different animals and feed them. <br><br>  Offer the official name for the new service, write the instructions for using it for the Help section and, if necessary, attach a list of questions that you would ask the manager. <br><br>  Note that: <br>  - so far there are only zebras and bison, <br>  - zebras can be fed, but there are no bison, <br>  - in order to stay there more than 40 hours a week, you must show your passport (this is fixed in the legislation of the Russian Federation, see Federal Law No. 201-FZ of August 24, 2001), <br>  - you can not bring food for zebras with you, but it is sold on the spot, <br>  - the cost of food shall not exceed the cost of entrance ticket, <br>  - a ticket for visitors costs 300 rubles, for disabled people and large families for free. <br><br>  Feed the animals can only carrots. <br></blockquote><p>  In this task there is one very unpleasant understatement: it is not clear where this service works, online or offline.  This is not immediately noticeable, but it is very disturbing in the process when you try to describe how to use it all. </p><br><p>  We expected people to notice and ask a question.  Or they will choose one point of view and write: I didn‚Äôt quite understand how this thing works, let's assume that this is so.  If I get it wrong, I'm ready to fix it. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0b/lt/dy/0bltdyfesaktjpycb8omtrgh2ma.png"></p><br><p>  But almost everyone who tried to write about Zebrovnik somehow tried to disguise this fact: if the task did not say, then we will go around it in the text.  It turned out not very: it is impossible to write clearly about what you do not understand yourself. </p><br><p>  And this task also assumes that the description of the service will not be advertising, but primarily informational (it has a special reference to our ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù, you can read and be inspired).  But no.  It seems that graceful graceful zebras and courageous bison from the answers to the test ones will haunt me all my life.  I have never thought of zebras in this way before. </p><br><h2 id="pochemu-nekotorye-zadaniya-takie-strannye">  Why are some tasks so strange </h2><br><p>  Sometimes (quite often) we are asked a question: why invent funny tasks, strange heroes, if this seems far from ordinary life?  You can just copy the right one from your task.  And it is not necessary to invent anything, and it is easier for people. </p><br><p>  There are several reasons, some are very subjective: </p><br><ol><li>  Real tasks to invent and choose as difficult as unrealistic (you may not believe, but it is). </li><li>  When we write about elephants, we are not afraid to pull something out under the NDA. </li><li>  This is such a compatibility check: if a person believes that we are too frivolous, it means that he will most likely be uncomfortable working with us.  Yes, we have a lot of work, the topics are serious, and we ourselves - well, not so much :) </li><li>  There is always the risk that we have already written about this real one and it can be found somewhere on the Internet. </li></ol><br><p>  What do you think happened to this simple test - a letter asking you to pay taxes? </p><br><h3 id="zadanie-4-pismo-pro-nalogi">  Task 4. A letter about taxes </h3><br><blockquote>  Imagine that a manager came to you and said: <br>  ‚ÄúWe want to make a newsletter about taxes: https://money.yandex.ru/taxes. <br><br>  We send out a thousand people who last year paid taxes at that time.  And in this something is not paid.  We want to remind them that we have such an opportunity - to pay everything quickly, to receive an electronic receipt.  Well, at the same time hurry: the tax is waiting for payments until December 1. " <br></blockquote><p>  That's right: people found our last letter, slightly corrected and rrraz!  - sent the result.  But, first, we remember our letters well.  Secondly, it was this letter that we didn‚Äôt like very much, and we wanted to look at the options better. </p><br><p>  About the same story happened when we took a rather complicated legal text from our site, spoiled it a little more and offered to edit it.  Approximately half of the people found our text in a search engine and issued it for their own. </p><br><p>  At this point, I want to beat my head on the table and exclaim: oh, people, well, do you really want to see a copy-paste in our place?  It seems obvious: no. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/im/9t/xs/im9txsqvkycvrwmsxr9evm7ein8.png"></p><br><h2 id="v-dvuh-slovah-pro-nashi-testovye-i-na-chto-my-smotrim">  In a nutshell, about our test and what we look at </h2><br><p>  So, if you have read this far, it seems that you deserve a brief summary.  In our test there are usually 3 small tasks: for example, you need to write texts for banners, prepare a newsletter and come up with a form.  Something to edit, something to criticize. </p><br><p>  We are waiting for the person who sends us a test: </p><br><ul><li>  read the task carefully and handle all the restrictions specified in it, </li><li>  look, as we write, and try to write in the same style, </li><li>  will take into account the format: for example, if there are already three headers on the page, then the fourth will agree with them, </li><li>  correctly writes and declines the names of our services in all texts, </li><li>  will not make mistakes (this seems to be obvious, but still: it seems to us that the editor is a person who writes without errors, and if he doubts, he can look in the reference book), </li><li>  will think about the users and do better than us. </li></ul><br><p>  And you also need to understand that the test task always has another side.  A person who does a test can evaluate how he works with us.  Everything that comes to our tasks (even about elephants and telepathy) is actually very, very, very similar to what we do every day.  If the test is interesting, if it is hooked, then (most likely), it will be interesting for you to work with us.  If it seemed that writing about telepathy was a hell of a routine and hurray, it ended - it means that you will be bored at work. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ty/-_/3g/ty-_3g6us4jy1uma3ean5x03wby.png"></p><br><h2 id="gde-posmotret-eschyo-zadaniya">  Where to see more tasks </h2><br><p>  We do not lay out the test tasks in open access, not because we feel sorry for, but because it is impossible.  Usually about 200 responses come to the vacancy of the editor.  You can view 200 resumes.  Carefully read and analyze 200 test - it seems, then we will only deal with this. </p><br><p>  If you are interested in what we came up with this time, respond <a href="https://hh.ru/vacancy/28926196">to our vacancy</a> , write a cool cover letter, and we will send you a new test.  We do not promise that there will be something fun, but there will definitely not be such as in this article :) </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432878/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432878/</a></p>
