  <section class="page js-page"><h1>55 reasons to use XHTML-CSS when creating websites</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <em>Translation of the article <a href="http://www.programimi.com/2007/09/14/55-reasons-to-design-in-xhtml-css/">"55 Reasons to Design in XHTML-CSS"</a> .</em> <br>  In a random order, here are my 55 reasons to create only <em>tableless</em> sites, using valid XHTML for markup, CSS for formatting, and Flash only as an appropriate insert.  By <em>bestablichnost</em> I understand avoiding the formatting of content tables (or "soup" from the replacement div div-s) and focus on the most semantic markup.  Some of the reasons listed above explain ‚Äúwhy not use plain HTML‚Äù, some ‚Äúwhy not do everything in Flash‚Äù, some refer to both the first and the second. <br>  I know that this topic has been discussed many times, but I will speak anyway <img src="http://blog.perfectomania.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  You may be referred to demonstrative sites such as <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">zengarden</a> , <a href="http://www.stylegala.com/">stylegala</a> , <a href="http://www.cssimport.com/">cssimport</a> and <a href="http://www.cssbeauty.com/">cssbeauty</a> . </li><li>  You do not need to spend extra time and energy thinking about the style of your code (write in capital letters or lower case, use quotes or not). </li><li>  You do not need to think about which tags to close and which ones can (should) be left open. </li><li>  You help search engines organize more relevant output by using semantic markup. </li><li>  You will save on your traffic, and visitors will load your pages faster by reducing their volume. </li><li>  It will be easier for you to upgrade to the XHTML 2.0 standard, which will provide even more semantic tools. </li><li>  As soon as you practice enough, page coding will become easier and faster for you than with any table soup. </li><li>  Which in turn will give you more time to take care of users. </li><li>  Thinking about semantics will help you make design, information, and architectural decisions. </li><li>  You can quickly create "raw" sites to test their information architecture, and add a "beautiful cover" later and with minimal changes in the code. </li><li>  You will be able to do the design after the completion of all the ‚Äúinternal‚Äù works, which will help your boss or client to realistically imagine how much time is left before the work is completed. </li><li>  You will have the opportunity to explicitly link to your internal pages (unlike Flash-sites). </li><li>  You can use browser features, such as reducing / increasing font size and back / forward buttons (as opposed to Flash sites). </li><li>  Redesign and reconfiguration of the entire site will become easier. </li><li>  It will be easier to perform the final touches at the completion of the design. </li><li>  Simple markup makes creating a CMS much easier, or generally irrelevant. </li><li>  Simple markup allows you to quickly connect to another developer. </li><li>  You will be able to develop internal functionality completely independently of the external representation, even by two unrelated people. </li><li>  You can play around with the details of your code, trying to please the search engines, without any harm to the appearance of the site. </li><li>  You will have full control over the version of your print pages. </li><li>  Your sites will automatically become available for all types of browsers ( <em>eg voice</em> browsers <em>, translator notes</em> ). </li><li>  Popularization of web standards will make your work easier in the future, thanks to eliminating the need to write code for each browser separately. </li><li>  When all items are closed, your code looks more elegant. </li><li>  Correctly composed code ensures that your site is correctly displayed in more browsers. </li><li>  Correctly composed code will allow browser developers to pay more attention to the development of useful innovations than to spend time supporting their ‚Äúbroken‚Äù code by browsers. </li><li>  Your site will be supported by browsers in the future. </li><li>  Your site will be better displayed on mobile devices. </li><li>  You will learn the basics of XML, which has many other uses. </li><li>  CSS files are saved in the browser's cache, which will allow you to reduce the response time and channel thickness required for your site. </li><li>  Your documents will become easier to convert to other formats using XSLT. </li><li>  Thinking about semantics will make you think more about your content. </li><li>  Studying semantics will allow you to become more organized, which will affect the quality of all the documents you create, even emails. </li><li>  You can add new technologies to your resume. </li><li>  Modern browsers render valid documents faster. </li><li>  You will feel better because you will know that you are creating websites ‚Äúcorrectly.‚Äù </li><li>  Web standards are supported by people like: <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/">Dan Cederholm</a> , <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> , <a href="http://www.jasonsantamaria.com/">Jason Santa Maria</a> , <a href="http://www.shauninman.com/">Shaun Inman</a> , <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/">Cameron Moll</a> , <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/">Douglas Bowman</a> , <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/">Dave Shea</a> ... </li><li>  You will become a member of the ‚Äúmovement‚Äù, thanks to which you will make useful contacts. </li><li>  You will become more respected by young browsers, which will increase competition in the market, thanks to which all browsers will become better. </li><li>  Blink tag will disappear. </li><li>  Hard coding standard will allow you to learn how to quickly identify their errors. </li><li>  You can earn money by teaching others about it, for example, by writing a book. </li><li>  You will have more opportunities when looking for work, thanks to new skills. </li><li>  You better understand how browsers work. </li><li>  You can use hacks and technologies with cool names like ‚Äúbe nice to Opera‚Äù. </li><li>  You will begin to pay more attention to meta-information, document typing and encoding assignment. </li><li>  With more people in the world making smaller pages, the flow of global traffic will decrease, which will improve the speed of the entire Internet. </li><li>  XHTML sounds cooler than just HTML. </li><li>  More people reflect on the advantages and disadvantages, as well as ways to use XHTML, which creates more space for sharing experiences. </li><li>  You can use almost the same markup for different sites. </li><li>  When you learn how to write code faster and easier, you can refuse expensive software. </li><li>  Google says that ( <em>compares the number of results for requests, approx. Translator</em> ): 4,380,000 xhtml better than html&gt; 4,370,000 html better than xhtml, 206 ‚Äúxhtml is better than html‚Äù&gt; 87 ‚Äúhtml is better than xhtml‚Äù, 2,130,000 xhtml sucks &lt; 10,300,000 html sucks. </li><li>  When all browsers learn how to correctly determine the MIME type, you will not need to convert all your websites from HTML, it will be enough just to specify the correct type. </li><li>  If more people start using XHTML, in the future IE will have to learn how to properly recognize the MIME type. </li><li>  The level of accessibility of your sites will increase, in particular through the use of the alt attribute in the pictures. </li><li>  There are simply no such number of reasons to make websites in plain HTML, or entirely in Flash. </li></ol><br><br><br>  Thanks to <a href="http://gogolev.net/" title="Your comments were very helpful.">GogA</a> for help with the translation! </div>
