Part 2 - Recruitment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  And so, hello! <br>  Today is the second article dedicated to the MCI project.  Let's talk about ... recruitment. <br>  As I mentioned in the first part, the next step for me was to be a set of followers - like-minded people. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Morning‚Ä¶</b> <br>  Waking up early in the morning, I already knew where to go after people. <br>  Alma Mater, where no matter how you look for support in the first place.  In addition, the graduating specialists are just in my profile.  Considering the fact that in my student years, the guys and I fostered the department (they did various jobs), I immediately went to the head of my department. <br>  ... you do not think, I believe in my project, but I just did not expect such a reaction.  Not only did the head of the department like my idea, he immediately offered me his help in terms of talking to ‚Äúbig uncles‚Äù about this project, which, I tell you, I was very happy about.  Since our head of the department is a man with a head (actually all of them, probably, such), he literally offered to organize a scientific conference on the basis of the university next year.  I also suggested several people ready to work in this project, one of them, like even a PhD ... <br><br>  <b>Day‚Ä¶</b> <br>  Already almost wound up, I went on.  The next stage was the ITC of the local branch of the Belarusian Railway.  Fortunately, with the boss, we had already crossed paths of work, right away, without much excitement, I went to her.  And what did I hear?  Yes, in fact, everything is the same: complete willingness to cooperate and, even, the joy of the fact that something is beginning to spin. <br><br>  <b>Evening‚Ä¶</b> <br>  After returning home, after all, on vacation you need a little and rest, went with the guys to sit in the evening - drink a beer.  And what would you think.  Word for word and, it turns out, one of my friends, at work, has a colleague who also became fascinated by my idea.  At that moment, I realized that the day had passed right away with a bang.

      <b>Before bedtime‚Ä¶</b> <br>  Having scrolled all day in my head, it was necessary to come to some conclusions: <br>  1) Still, it is worth believing in your undertakings; <br>  2) Personal communication is worth a lot.  No mailing will not work; <br>  3) Friends, they will help. <br><br>  <b>Results</b> : the <u>first stage of recruitment was clear - 2/2.</u> <br><br>  <b>Archive:</b> <br>  <a href="http://andreevich.habrahabr.ru/blog/70684/">Diary of MSI.</a>  <a href="http://andreevich.habrahabr.ru/blog/70684/">Part 1 - Start.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70928/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70928/</a></p>
