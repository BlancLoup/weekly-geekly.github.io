  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Working in Austria for IT IT: Profitable and Fun</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to talk about how the holidays are ordinary IT pros in Austria.  I have already written about <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/239495/">how profitable to work in Austria</a> . <br><br>  Let's start with the fact that not only Russia is rich in national holidays and weekends.  In Austria, they are also mass, and most of them fall in the spring.  For example, the weekend on Monday after Catholic Easter, May 1, Ascension, the weekend in early June, May 14, etc. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition, a vacation in Austria lasts 5 weeks, not 4. The working week is 38 hours - only 5 hours work on Friday.  Many of those who live far from work take home-office on Friday, or work an hour more all week long to have a day off on Friday.  It is also possible to work just 32 hours, i.e.  4 days a week.  And any convenient number of days or hours per week can work (for example, 20 or 16, or 30).  Of course, the payment will be less - based on the hours worked.  Recycling is practically prohibited without any serious reason. <br><br>  Now about the holidays themselves, which is full of working life in Austria.  The main holiday is, of course, Christmas.  Christmas in the company usually begins to celebrate from 22 numbers, on Thursday, to take a day off on Friday.  December 25 and 26 are public holidays, January 1 and January 6 are also public holidays.  The 31st and 24th are most often short days.  Therefore, if you want to relax on New Year's holidays, then use just this 5th week of vacation.  Together with Saturdays and Sundays 10-12 days come out.

      Holidays - 190 hours, i.e.  5 weeks is given immediately upon employment.  It can be used from the first day, for example, to take a vacation for an hour.  Also, vacation can be taken in advance from next year. <br><br>  At firms, especially among IT specialists, as in Russia, it is customary to drink beer.  Once I had a project management presentation.  The boss himself brought a box of beer so that the audience was not bored.  But after 5:00 pm hardly anyone will linger even on beer, all the pleasures at work also during working hours. <br><br>  At Christmas, a serious party begins with a joint dinner in a restaurant or right in the office.  In one department, developers ordered a German pub directly to the office.  those.  everything, including food, wooden benches and tables like Oktoberfest filled the corridors between the offices.  At 18.00 the company invites to the official part on the street, organized in the style of the Christmas market, only mulled wine and snacks are free.  The event ends with salute and bus to the city center.  In addition, the company gives Christmas gifts from products that it produces itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c1/a7b/c1b/8c1a7bc1bdd34f81acd1b4c072bfdc91.jpg"><br><br>  Next, an interesting event takes place in February, associated with carnivals and dressing up.  This year, our ABAP-developers and SAP HR consultants came to work in the costumes of "Braveheart", some witches and other stuffed animals.  The city was also walking, so on the way home I just happened to be in Wonderland, surrounded by various creatures, draculas, beautiful women with colored hair and other monsters. <br><br>  Last year, developers have replaced all the inscriptions on the doors of the office.  Usually there is the name, surname and academic degree of the employees working in this office.  Developers have reversed the letters in the names so that at first you will not notice. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/027/c6b/45e/027c6b45edf546b7900c1ac6e3f550a9.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Our company annually conducts team raids, which are partly sponsored by the union.  So, we choose a place: either a hotel in the mountains, or a bowling alley, or wine tasting in Italy - and we are going to rest there with the whole team.  I will not go into details, so everyone knows how this ends.  But be careful: they say that managers are trying to follow who and how behaves in a somewhat drunken state. <br><br>  In winter, we often have joint attacks on alpine skiing or sledging: who is more interesting.  Sometimes the company offers free tickets to the presentation of a new film, or some events with children and family. <br><br>  In general, working in a large and even a small company in Austria, even being a newcomer in the country, is impossible to miss, because  offers how to spend free time mass, just manage to attend to all.  So over time, the area can be friends and acquaintances. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376597/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376597/</a></p>
