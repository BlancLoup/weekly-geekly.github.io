The sophisticated Moscow public had something to see: a crypto bank machine, a portrait of a Crypto Mom and more than 200 experts of the cryptoindustry. <br><br><h4>  Modern art </h4><br>  If you are not particularly interested in cryptocurrency, then it is simply impossible to go past modern creativity.  May the author of these masterpieces forgive me, but unfortunately there is no signature on the photo. <br><br>  <i>Crypto mother</i>

As far as I understood it was a test version offering the sale / purchase of BTC, ETH and LTC.  It only works with cash - no cards or PayPal, only Fiat.  I am a man spoiled by a modern card system, I didn‚Äôt have cash with me.  Therefore, I could not buy anything, and pity the course was even better than in some online exchangers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ob/kl/mf/obklmfrfdp5zn9mvx1tjr2djysc.jpeg" alt="image" width="500"></div><br>  They produce a crypto miracle in Europe, representatives say that it‚Äôs safer there, in Russia they can plant for such equipment under the article ‚Äúillegal banking‚Äù.  When I asked how they were able to hold this crypto machine into the territory of Russia and present it at an official event with the participation of officials, the guys mysteriously smiled ... <br><br>  Undoubtedly at the event was something to see and listen to.  The organizers tried to cover all areas of interest: practical advice on how to conduct ISO, legislative support, training for the digital digital economy, master classes in IT security.  The work of the Congress was divided into 5 platforms and none of them was empty for two days. <br><br><h4>  What was interesting </h4><br>  <b>First, the creation of the Russian pool of miners.</b>  It is planned to unite Russian miners, which, according to the statement of RAKIBA, are 75000 and these are only mining enterprises in Russia.  Of course, the question of the taxation of miners was again discussed, and whether to consider ‚Äúnaminennoe‚Äù income.  The State Duma has already received 3 bills, but what we get at the exit is unknown.  According to one of them, miners are proposed to equate to individual entrepreneurs, although they promise 2 years of tax holidays.  We'll see‚Ä¶ <br><br>  <i>- I believe that operations with cryptocurrencies should be removed from VAT.</i>  <i>At the same time, miners say they mine digital gold.</i>  <i>This is a joke, but if they continue to say so, they will wait for the mineral extraction tax, - said Ilya Kucherov (Institute of Legislation and Comparative Law at the Government of the Russian Federation).</i> <br><br>  <b>Secondly, all interested parties were invited to participate in the development of a legislative framework and unite in a self-regulated organization of the blockchain and cryptocurrency.</b>  The Russian experience of SRO is not very successful, remember at least construction SRO.  It is difficult to talk about the prospects of such an organization, the main thing is not to interfere. <br><br>  <b>Thirdly, RAKIB will sue Google, Twitter, Facebook and Yandex because of the ban on advertising ICO and cryptocurrency.</b>  Rakibovts intend to go to the American courts through a new Eurasian association.  In the light of the latest international events, I consider this business to be not very promising, but as a way of PR, it works fine. <br><br>  For two days, experts and entrepreneurs discussed the prospects for the development of cryptoindustry.  The officials distinguished themselves: <br><br>  - Herman and I, as officials, the Ministry of Labor has allowed us to keep accounts in Bitcoins.  The official application was.  Then they began to say that, on the contrary, they will start imprisoning for this ... - Boris Titov (authorized by the president for the protection of the rights of entrepreneurs) told about the sad everyday life of officials. <br><br>  - We will not propagate officials.  Roscryptonadzor will not appear, - German Klimenko (presidential adviser on Internet issues) assured everyone. <br><br>  I think it is worth staying at this promising phrase, there were a lot of interesting and useful things at this event, thanks to the speakers and organizers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p8/fj/ri/p8fjri_yy_rggg0gwhu6dy86jgq.jpeg" alt="image" width="500"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/352604/">https://habr.com/ru/post/352604/</a></p>
