  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Three common mistakes in communication with the client</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On duty, we often have to communicate with freelancers.  This communication often goes beyond the working framework, becoming a friendly-friendly.  In private conversations about freelance life often had to hear about the same problems that arise when dealing with a direct client.  Let's look at the three tips that have been given most often: <br><ul><li>  Do not restrict communication by correspondence. </li><li>  Explain the workflow to the client </li><li>  The main question for all occasions: "What is the goal?" </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Do not restrict communication by correspondence. </h4><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúMake an assessment of the correction of incorrect, in your opinion, prototypes, so that they become correct in cases where there are incorrect prototypes.‚Äù</i> <br>  <a href="http://clientsfromhell.ru/2010/12/24/15-12-10102443/">A source</a> </blockquote>  How many times have you received such ‚Äúnot-understand-what‚Äù comments from a client?  In the saddest cases, the customer then refers to these fragments of phrases, as to a signed three hundred-page contract. <br><br>  The fact is that all people communicate not only with the help of words (verbally).  What they say is also reinforced paraverbally (intonation, tempo of speech, etc.) and non-verbally (with gestures, facial expressions).  There are different opinions on how relatively important each of the three channels of information transfer, but most importantly, all three are important! <br><br>  Clients are ordinary people.  Among them is the same percentage of intelligent, pleasant people, and idiots who did not study well at school, as well as among you and your acquaintances.  Many of them do not know how (for various reasons) to express their thoughts in <i>writing</i> .

      <br>
      It is necessary to understand: the <i>responsibility for the fact that you understand the client lies with you</i> .  We recommend building your communication as follows: <br><ul><li>  Before you start, find out the <i>phone</i> or, in the worst case, Skype-contact customer.  Speak separately that you need voice contact, and for complex projects - eye-to-eye (via Skype, or better personally).  Do not take the project if the customer is not satisfied: the probability of serious problems in communication, and, therefore, in the work, will be very high. </li><li>  When you receive an incoherent text from a client, <i>call him</i> and directly tell you that you misunderstood his message and ask him to repeat it in other words.  At first it seems scary to set yourself up as an idiot, but nothing happens except to improve understanding. </li><li>  Having understood the client‚Äôs words, what he wanted, be sure to <i>repeat to</i> him what he said in his own words.  "Thanks for the clarifications!  So, I understood you correctly that ...? " </li><li>  If everything is in order, thank the customer for the time spent, write down and send it to the customer a <i>summary of the conversation</i> . </li></ul>  Generally speaking, it is useful to do so even if the task is clear to you (omitting the second step).  Formulate the problem as you understand it, and seek confirmation from the client, preferably a written one. <br><br><h4>  Explain the workflow to the client </h4><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúYes, we like this layout of the main page!</i>  <i>Today, the site already run? "</i> <br>  <a href="http://clientsfromhell.ru/2010/12/17/25-11-1083252/">A source</a> </blockquote>  You often find yourself in a situation where the work is almost done, and then the client intended to make edits that change almost all the logic of the site.  Or, having approved a couple of layouts you have drawn, the client asks: ‚ÄúTomorrow I will be able to fill the site with texts?‚Äù. <br><br>  This happens because the client does not understand the technology of creating websites.  He has his own picture of the world, he is not to blame for what he does not understand: to alter the design at the testing stage is equivalent to doing the work anew.  In his ignorance, he is like a child - since no one said that this is impossible, then it is possible. <br><br>  Responsibility for the fact that the client understands you and shares your approach to work (surprise! Surprise!) Also rests entirely on you. <br><br>  That is why before you start working on a project, <i>you must fully agree on the working process</i> : both verbally and in writing (not by agreement, at least by letter in the mail).  Keep in mind that speaking is very important: many do not read what they confirm (when was the last time you read the whole EULA on software?). <br><br>  Yes, you will then formally reject the claims, but the client will be unhappy and will not come to you again. <br><ul><li>  Clarify first what the client wants and what is the <i>formulation of the problem</i> (the algorithm is described above). </li><li>  Understand exactly how you will work and <i>formalize the workflow</i> : what are the stages, how long they will last, when and what results the client must agree on what to do if he wants to make edits at later stages. </li><li>  <i>Speak</i> successively to each client of the process.  Ask if there are any questions or something with which he does not agree. </li><li>  <i>Obtain</i> both verbal and written confirmation that the client agrees to follow the proposed process. </li></ul>  The very idea that you, so ingenious and terribly busy, have to deal with such nonsense, like the education of a client, is very annoying: this is already a little bit much.  However, only in this way can you be responsible for the success of the project.  Only having done everything that depended on you, you have the right to call a client a dumbass (unfortunately, there are those too, which are already there). <br><br><h4>  The main question for all occasions: "What is the goal?" </h4><blockquote>  <i>Let's play with colors (let's play with fonts, move blocks).</i> </blockquote>  There are often cases when a client needs to do some stupid work.  And again a surprise: he is again like a child, who quite sincerely thinks that the vinaigrette still-life with a cat looks very beautiful.  You are a professional, and you must deter him from such inclinations. <br><br>  Fortunately, customers are already adults.  Unlike children, who understand the motivation ‚Äúwhy‚Äù (‚ÄúWhy should I do this?‚Äù - ‚ÄúBecause the smart uncle said so!‚Äù), Adults are guided by the motivation ‚Äúwhy‚Äù (‚ÄúWhy should I do?‚Äù - ‚ÄúThen, that this and that will result ‚Äù). <br><br>  In our example (finally, this is a common place) you are responsible for ensuring that the client abandons his idea of ‚Äã‚Äãplaying with fonts.  This can be done by asking the question ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù, Finding out what exactly the client does not like and why he wants to make changes.  And as soon as the client wanted to play with the fonts, ask him the question: how, in his opinion, <i>will</i> it <i>serve the goals and objectives of the project</i> (did you formulate them before starting work? No?! Nuuu ...), which he himself approved with his own signature ? <br><br>  Surprisingly, behind this most ‚Äúlet's play with fonts‚Äù there are often some sensible thoughts that the client cannot formulate yet, but feels like some kind of client chuyka.  And it may turn out that the blocks really need to be moved, and the most important message on the page turns out to be imperceptible. <br><br><h4>  Instead of a resume </h4><br>  Summing up the line, I will list the important settings for any manager and freelancer (who is his own manager), I‚Äôm not afraid of this word, <i>basic</i> settings: <ul><li>  Be active. </li><li>  Responsibility both for the fact that you understand the client, and for the fact that the client understands you, lies with you. </li><li>  Be sure to use the voice in communication, and in large projects - personal meetings. </li><li>  Before starting work, find out the objectives of the project and agree on the work process in advance. </li><li>  Use the question ‚ÄúWhat is the purpose?‚Äù Instead of the question ‚ÄúAre you a fool?‚Äù To any strange client requests.  Very often there is a grain of truth in them - learn to find it. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113363/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113363/</a></p>
