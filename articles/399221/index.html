But there are opportunities for acquiring brand electronics at much lower prices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ff/abe/2f5/1ffabe2f586fdead42cacc706a4a872d.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Refurbished </h2><br>  The best way to purchase electronics in the US is "restored" devices.  They come in two categories - either visited the factories of the manufacturer, or restored by the seller.  Acquisition of the second involves certain risks, and it should be considered only with extremely good feedback about the seller. <br><br>  Many companies are doing just that - buying equipment, repairing and selling.  Anyway, they all give a guarantee, and the purchased goods fall under the protection of the buyer (if, of course, PayPal, eBay or Amazon are involved in the sales chain).  Thus, risks are minimized.

      Officially restored equipment is offered with the complete execution of the necessary documents, and is often practically new.  There are no risks in acquiring such electronics. <br><br>  <i>The total discount on refurbished devices can reach 30%.</i> <br><br><h2>  Openbox goods </h2><br>  This is probably the most profitable lots in any online store.  We <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/282568/">wrote</a> about them not so long ago, so it does not make sense to paint too much: bought, opened the box, did not like it - returned it to the store.  As a result, according to American rules and traditions, the device becomes cheaper by 40 percent. And if it was purchased for a stock, even more. <br><br><h2>  Used machinery </h2><br>  To drag second-hand from abroad - pleasure not the most pleasant.  But it all depends on the seller, the benefits and the site where the device is purchased.  The cost in comparison with the starting one is reduced by almost half, and although this option is much worse than the previous ones - you should not discount it.  And that's why. <br><br><h2>  Warranty </h2><br>  Most electronics break down either in the first 7 days, or right after the warranty period.  In 7 days you can identify most of the possible (and already described) problems.  Why described?  Under the sales in the United States rarely get the latest models.  Usually this is a lot of devices with a fairly large community of owners. <br><br>  This leads to excellent results: everything is studied in detail, problems are either resolved - or written off into marriage.  And there are already validation algorithms.  For PayPal and large retailers like Amazon or Ebay, this information is considered to be a reason to return (especially if there are official answers from the manufacturer). <br><br>  Officially restored equipment is subject to a factory warranty - depending on the manufacturer, from 3 months to a year.  The equipment restored by the seller is covered by its warranty with a predetermined period of time.  Openbox technology is sold with the official manufacturer's warranty.  By the way, on second-hand devices, marketplaces set a small warranty period, which allows a volume to verify the purchase. <br><br><h2>  How to minimize the risks in acquiring </h2><br>  First, with the purchase worth paying attention to the warranty period.  They should be listed on the product page.  If the seller stipulates that the warranty is not installed on the lot - it is worth looking for something else. <br><br>  For officially restored devices, you can take advantage of an international guarantee in accordance with established periods.  Buy devices, restored by the seller, can be fearless - if you do not plan to use warranty repairs.  Basic protection of online retailers like the possibility of returning the device within 15-30 days is enough to identify a marriage.  Otherwise, you must contact the seller and negotiate the possibility of the implementation of the warranty. <br><br>  Worse with buying used devices.  In this case, you need to pay only PayPal - this is the only way to return money from an unscrupulous seller.  It allows you to test the device, but all procedures, starting with the receipt of the parcel, must be documented on video.  In this case, you can buy everything that the buyer's protection extends to (which is indicated by the beautiful logo on the lots). <br><br><h2>  The basic rules of online shopping </h2><br>  It is advisable to send expensive devices by accelerated delivery methods, for example, our Express Mail - this allows you to have time to realize the possibility of a simple return of goods (most American online stores offer direct returns without a reason within 15 days).  A box broken in half should not be taken away from the postal service under any pretext, immediately drawing up a protocol. <br><br>  Of course, do not forget about the need for documents in the package - and, of course, the warranty card.  In the tax return, it is also worth pointing out the official cost (reduced - not for the full purchase), and prepare a screenshot of payment in advance. <br><br>  The entire purchase process also needs to be documented - save screenshots of the lot, payment.  And, of course, do not clear the logs of payment systems and entries in the retailers personal account.  The same goes for reviews - until the buyer clicks on a button like ‚ÄúGoods received, thank you‚Äù - the retailer and the payment system are on the buyer's side. <br><br>  <i><b>Buy while you can:</b></i> <br> <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91a/388/404/91a3884042444f849c2fec2aa3d4cbce.png"></a> <br><br>  By tradition, the first order is a $ 5 discount on the <b>supergeek</b> promo code. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399221/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399221/</a></p>
