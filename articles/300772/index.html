      Sincerely yours, <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> full-line operator <br>  ( <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> - turn your online store into a computer game) <br><br>  Each small business owner needs certain tools in order to launch their new marketing campaigns.  Frankly, too many of these tools are suitable only for businesses at the level of large enterprises or require such costs that are not always justified. <br>  After testing a variety of marketing tools, we picked the most optimal (and that is not unimportant - free versions), they will be useful for any small business. <br><br><h4>  <b>1. Answer The Public</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be1/0bc/659/be10bc6590114f418aebe7ca529f4689.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Answer The Public is a free tool.  It is used to group topics and questions asked by people relating to primary keywords by topic, and shapes them into separate, similar categories.  Then you can try to answer most queries related specifically to your content.  Thus, when Google looks at which sites contain the most up-to-date information on the requested topic, you are much more likely to not only sort your site in search results, but also to entice visitors, because you will answer the most important questions that interest them . <br><br><h4>  <b>2. Open Site Explorer</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/686/119/527/6861195271184c23b758f9658d5b3808.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Understanding your reference profile and your competitors' reference profile is crucial for creating a personal domain center.  One of the most effective actions in the implementation of the next SEO campaign is to copy and paste your competitor's URL into Open Site Explorel and find all the sites that are related to it, but not linked to your site. <br><br><h4>  <b>3. Screaming Frog</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e74/ab3/374/e74ab33746c34050809fd214c7003816.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Screaming Frog is a reliable tool for general site auditing.  They have a paid version, but you can also scan up to 500 pages of the site under investigation for free.  This tool is very useful for finding broken links, data on redirects, it finds pages that pass metadata, and also finds duplicate content at the URL level. <br><br><h4>  <b>4. Siteliner</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/510/11a/95a/51011a95ab6c4cd0931fc90b09e146a4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Siteliner is ideal for quick analysis of repetitive content on the site.  Again, the creators limit the number of pages you can scan, but 99% of small businesses completely cost the free version.  Just put the URL in their search bar and click Go.  You will receive a ton of useful data, such as: <br><ul><li>  Duplicate content </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Shared content </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Unique content </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Average page size </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Average page load time </li></ul><br><ul><li>  The number of words on the page </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Internal links </li></ul><br><ul><li>  External links </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Text to code ratio </li></ul><br><br><h4>  <b>5. Portent's Title Generator</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fcd/a88/760/fcda887604b04cca9e49385141e1754a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Say goodbye to the creative crisis using this handy tool.  Use Portent's Title Generator to come up with content that users want to share with each other on the web.  With a simple touch of a button, this free tool generates fresh names for familiar things, ranging from serious to humorous.  Users usually do not think in this vein: ‚ÄúWhat a boring article!  But I will read it! ‚Äù  They are interested in exciting and easy to submit material.  So have fun with them, and even if you can't find the perfect slogan or title, you will get a lot of inspiration anyway. <br><br><h4>  <b>6. Google Keyword Planner</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8e/1d0/f11/f8e1d0f112d0421f96d80fca1e306a73.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Google's keyword tool (Google's Keyword Tool) is a major resource for any small business that launches Pay Per Click.  When setting up AdWords, there are countless possibilities for using this tool.  One of the most important features of Google's keyword tool is a search calculator.  You can enter a keyword and see how many people searched for it each month over the past year.  You can search for new keywords by phrase, site or category, get statistics of queries and trends, select keywords based on existing lists, and also get an efficiency forecast for clicks and expenses. <br><br><h4>  <b>7. Moz Local: Check Listing</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/010/f0c/95d/010f0c95d5044d10b59c7b2320315c74.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The key goal for any small business that runs its business is its ability to show the search engines on the consistency of their name, address and telephone number (NAT) through citation sources such as Google, Yelp, Facebook, Yellowpages and others.  The Moz Local's tool provides a free opportunity to check the loyalty of NAT and easily fix it yourself if it is not in accordance with reality.  Or you can pay extra to do it for you.  In any case, this is a great free tool for quick analysis and improvement. <br><br><h4>  <b>8. Keyword.io</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/518/232/fff/518232fffbec4c51a70ddad8179cdb45.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Keyword research is a necessary tool for every small business that uses SEO optimization.  With this handy tool, you can get ideas for keywords from Google and Fiverr that will help you understand which of them are important for targeting and which of them are suitable for filling content.  Unfortunately, the possibility of obtaining important indicators of competitiveness such as search volume or competitiveness of keywords is not free. <br>  If you have free cash, Moz Pro has done a lot of work with its keyword selection tool, as well as recently launched an improved version with partially free access.  There is also a long-standing long-loved Long Tail Pro platform that will integrate with Moz and Adwords, and provide data on a huge scale. <br><br><h4>  <b>9. Facebook Audience Insights</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53e/d74/1b3/53ed741b36374e0a9c7a3d19690723f6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Facebook Audience Insights is a terrific free tool for market and content research.  By switching with options, you can view specific demographic information for your audience and even discover new data. <br>  How to use this tool?  Let Facebook Audience Insights help you create extraordinarily interesting content that will appeal to your audience.  For example, if you are a local business that you are developing in your region / district / location, switch to the advanced settings menu (at the bottom of the left column), select "home" and start exploring exactly what people in your region are interested in. . <br><br><h4>  <b>10. Pablo by Buffer</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/567/0fd/7f7/5670fd7f7b74495abfb72585387d1430.png" alt="image"><br><br>  With this free tool, you have access to over 600,000 images (or you can upload your own image) and all the tools you need to fit in with the social image.  You choose an image, and then apply text, select dimensions, filters, logos, and upload it all to your site.  Pablo provides a simple opportunity to grow from a simple Photoshop user to a professional media designer. <br><br><h4>  <b>Bonus: Followerwonk</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df4/12a/c26/df412ac26e6b49c7ac75dafe02639d40.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Followerwonk analyzes your Twitter followers in a surprisingly quick and easy way to get the necessary information that your brand can use.
