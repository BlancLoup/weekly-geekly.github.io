  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why is your online advertising not working?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The eternal theme: the client complains that he planned and carried out an advertising campaign, and the output is zero.  Or even a big minus - the budget is spent.  And it turns out that it is not so good, this is the Internet advertising, and quite the opposite. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Options for complaints are usually two: <br><br>  - advertising is hanging, but no one clicks.  If this is a ‚Äúcontext‚Äù, then at least the money is intact, and if the media banner, then tens and hundreds of thousands of shows burn out without a trace. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      - click on advertisements perfectly, the budget burns like gunpowder, and almost all the transitions - one view.  And the average time of the ‚Äúadvertising‚Äù visitor on the site is significantly less than a minute. <br><br>  Here the client often makes an expressive face and expresses himself in the sense that <br><br>  a) the system / platform is blatantly lying about its statistics (if not clicked);  and <br><br>  b) this system / site probably has its own crowd of clickers, who click tirelessly for a modest bribe on ads.  They clicked - and then ran.  Just to create visibility, but money to write off.  (This is if they click, but do not really look.) <br><br>  In general, the terms of continuous deception and kidalovo. <br><br>  However, when we start analyzing a failed campaign, everything turns out to be much simpler.  As is easy to guess, in the overwhelming majority of cases, the reasons for failure are related to the quality of advertising (no clicks) and the quality of the ‚Äúlanding page‚Äù (no views). <br><br>  The quality of advertising is an eternal and universal theme.  I have already given <a href="http://www.marketing-audit.ru/notes/notes_62.html">examples from offline</a> , where the creators of advertising themselves, it seems, did not understand what they were selling.  Online, everything is the same, only worse.  Because more options. <br><br>  Here are a couple of examples. <br><br>  Flash banner to be placed on industry sites: <a href="http://marketing-audit.ru/notes/primer/ban/">see</a> <br><br>  Try to guess from three attempts, what exactly is he advertising?  Over all, it turns out that the phone and e-mail.  The question is - what can make the client click on him?  And money will drip! <br><br>  By the way, in this case, the banner was corrected after indicating the problem.  It did not become ideal, but a little more transparency appeared. <br><br>  Another example.  Advertising campaign in Yandex.Direct (ad in the red frame): <br><br><img src="http://www.marketing-audit.ru/netcat_files/Image/direct2.jpg"><br><br>  The query in the search box is ‚ÄúYandex conference‚Äù.  Apparently, the campaign was set to the keyword "conference".  Let us ask ourselves - what should have attracted the attention of the user in this ad?  What should have made him click?  What do all these words mean? <br><br>  An ad in a gray frame is also bad, but for other reasons.  It is simply hard to read - the title is overloaded and in fact does not tell the user anything, the text consists of a vague mess: letters, numbers, abbreviation. <br><br>  What does this mean in practice?  That some of the users simply do not notice the ad, do not realize its meaning, will pass by.  And marketers of the company will conclude - information about discounts does not work as well as expected. <br><br>  We summarize: creating advertising, you need to repeatedly check whether the meaning is clear and obvious to the people who were not involved in creating this advertisement.  And if it is suddenly incomprehensible or not immediately understandable - modifying it with a file to a victorious end (the exception is ‚Äúadvertisement-intrigue‚Äù, but this is not about it now). <br><br>  But here we finished our banner and hung it on the Most Popular Page.  And the people tumbled down.  And what does this people see? <br><br>  Now I will give a very clinical example.  Somehow I clicked on the announcement of interest in Direct.  But at that moment I was busy, so I opened the page in the background tab, and did not immediately look at it.  When in a couple of hours I stumbled upon it, I fell into a stupor for a long time - what is it, where did it come from?  Just remembering all-all-all of his actions lately, he realized that this is the page that opened on advertising.  It is not clear from the screenshot, but in fact the site was made using flash-animation - everything is moving, overflowing, moving in orbits and all that: <br><br>  (click to view in large size) <br> <a href=""><img src="http://www.marketing-audit.ru/netcat_files/Image/gl2.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Traditional question: what does this company do?  An additional question: what remains to be done by the visitor who clicked on an interesting and specific ad, and got on this page? <br><br>  That is what happens.  At first, people spent decent efforts to create an anti-marketing website, from which even what they do is not clear, then they made a selling ad and began to split the budget on a beautiful homepage.  And in the end, apparently, will draw conclusions about the effectiveness of Internet advertising. <br><br>  We summarize: <br><br>  1) On any page of your site it should be unambiguously clear what this site is about.  Immediately, at first glance. <br><br>  2) Internet advertising should lead not to the main page of the site, but to the page that is most adequate to the ad.  If you are advertising a product, the ad should lead to a product, rather than a catalog of twenty thousand items.  If the service - then on the page with the description of the service, so that the user immediately got what he came for.  Otherwise, you just lose money in vain. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/106957/">https://habr.com/ru/post/106957/</a></p>
