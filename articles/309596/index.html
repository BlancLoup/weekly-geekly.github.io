      Transcript under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Hi everyone! <br>  G5.  The first step is aspect-oriented programming. <br>  It's not classical in G5, let's look at it. <br>  Here is a simple method with some business logic.  It's short and understandable. <br>  But programs usually contain other aspects <br>  For example, business restrictions. <br>  Another aspect is checking for system errors. <br>  Don't forget about error handlers. <br>  Sometimes you need logger for debugging. <br>  Aspect of documentation is very important too. <br>  As you are looking for your code, you really need it. <br>  Let's also take a look at the metadata tests for unit tests. <br>  And now, you can do it with aspects. <br>  First, you can hide the screen using this buttons. <br>  Secondly, you can debug and optimization. <br>  You can define your own aspect, for example aspect of the security. <br>  You can use the code of the source code. <br>  Specification language: it's designed for distributed applications. <br>  The first part of it is ‚Äúentities‚Äù.  They are like data contracts, but better. <br>  You can define it. <br>  Thera are no data types of G5, so you can use it with any programming languages. <br>  Specification of the source code;  I‚Äôm using metadata for the compiler instead of inheritance. <br>  You can choose your own field. <br>  But it is necessary to be compatible with the types of the entity. <br>  You can set. <br>  You can even rename fields. <br>  You can‚Äôt ignore it. <br>  And of course you can't change business restrictions. <br>  Well; <br>  How to create enterprise solutions. <br>  Specification language is an aspect of the design;  you can hide it and disable compilation for it. <br>  The second part of the specification language is API. <br>  You can describe your API using WSDL or any other languages.  Here is an example for USDS. <br>  I will create a server for this API. <br>  In this case, the compiler will use myServer. <br>  This is a very fast and simple way to create a server application. <br>  The next part is library specifications. <br>  Plugin for the application using specification language. <br>  I defined description of the library, two classes. <br>  Now, I can create realization of this specification. <br>  The compiler will be in the library file. <br>  In the library. <br>  I will import my plugin dynamically. <br>  The compiler will create new business methods and the first class. <br>  You can use the same way to import standard Windows or Linux dynamic libraries. <br>  Chapter three - Declarative programming using widgets. <br>  There are many widgets in G5, I will show you four of them. <br>  The first one is a text widget. <br>  You can use any symbols inside it. <br>  You can define this text field. <br>  The next one is a source code widget. <br>  It is syntax highlighting and macros. <br>  You can use the code. <br>  The third example is a widget for user interfaces. <br>  You can use the elements in the source code. <br>  G5 with regular expressions etc.  You can also create a new widget for G5. <br>  The last example is a widget ‚ÄúReport‚Äù. <br>  This widget can contain the source code. <br>  It can be used as the ‚Äúmain.code‚Äù for the file. <br>  The widget can request data formatting. <br>  You can save the report in PDF, HTML or any other format. <br>  And here is the result. <br>  Chapter four, Language oriented programming. <br>  You can create your own domain-specific programming language using G5. <br>  Thera are in the G5. <br>  The language of semantics.  Let's have a look at it. <br>  Here is a class with an array of inside.  You can set the element's value using this method. <br>  But it looks not good.  The batter way is using an access operator. <br>  I will define this constriction using the keyword ‚ÄúSemantics‚Äù. <br>  The first part is the code template. <br>  I wrote only for lines and it works now. <br>  What about more complex constructions? <br>  For example, a cycle in this style. <br>  And again, I'm defining the pattern.  Seven lines and it works too. <br>  Another useful thing is physical variables. <br>  You can define it. <br>  You can also define. <br>  The values ‚Äã‚Äãwill be converted correctly after that. <br>  Conversions between possible variables and G5 types are possible too. <br>  The compiler controls all wrong conversions. <br>  Well, create a new domain-specific language. <br>  That's all for today. <br>  If you like this presentation, please share it with your friends. <br>  I‚Äôm ready to answer any questions, please contact me at this email address. <br>  Thank you for your attention. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309596/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309596/</a></p>
