More than a year ago I tried, then sat down, and now I finally retrained in a developer for iOS.  Together with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/konovalove/" class="user_link">Konovalove,</a> we developed the concept of a geosocial client of Meetweet (and wrote this article).  It would seem that the phrase ‚Äúnew geosocial network‚Äù for the last couple of years has been perceived as an anecdote.  All have long understood that an attempt to create something new in this niche, trying to ‚Äúleave‚Äù at the expense of expensive design, a huge number of features or incredible marketing budgets is utopia.  The main problem of social networks based on geo-positioning - there is no one there, and from this to publish something there the user does not have a desire!  No  Totally.  No one likes loneliness.  And below we will make it clear what our fundamental difference is from the ‚Äúgeosocialisks‚Äù and which pivots occurred (and which ones will occur) during our work on the project. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1HWy46IYr7k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhj4qwtAW1YcYVRKB4jw2jdMKqKK_w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  History of creation </h4><br>  Yandex.Maps - infinitely useful [there was too bright a word for an article on Habr√©] for bored drivers.  No, really!  If you have never read ALL WITHOUT EXCLUSION "Talkers" on Yandex.Maps around you, then you are most likely a pedestrian.  There is some kind of driving sense of solidarity and kinship (and a general hatred for the road hamam too), unknown to pedestrians.  It makes drivers create traffic events on Yandex.Maps, describe in detail in which series of accidents occurred and appeal to general justice and respect, creating ‚ÄúTalkers‚Äù on this map.  But damn it!  These road events can not be commented on, and their authors are anonymous and inaccessible for communication, which means that this is not a full-fledged social network, but so close to it!  And if Yandex did not want to give this feeling of ‚Äúdriver boredom and lack of communication‚Äù to spill out to the full, giving rise to a wonderful and obviously demanded (and popular, we remember the number of Yandex.Maps users) service, then why not build your amusement park with communication and maps?  However, to hell with an amusement park.  On this and decided. <br><br>  The task that confronted us could be described in one sentence: ‚ÄúTo make a fairly anonymous service in which you can create (and delete, of course) your posts and respond to others so that they are all displayed on the map.‚Äù  We have not forgotten about anonymity - this is a very important factor.  If it were not for him, on Yandex.Maps everyone would be shy and afraid to personalize.  Drivers, such drivers. <br><br>  But!  We remember that we are doing a service for people who can not stand alone, launching the application.  We began to wrestle with how to increase the efficiency of our application as a means of boredom (with minimal cost) (read, so that there would be a lot of users at once, and inside there was something to read and see).  The idea that Yandex has a number of users that we can only dream about so far didn‚Äôt give rest ... [I think this offer is superfluous] <br><br>  After some thought, we came to the conclusion that becoming a Twitter client is the most acceptable option.  We kill all the hares at once: <br>  - millions of tweets around the world that we can display on the map; <br>  - reply / retweet / follow / mention and viewing photos uploaded to Twitter is quite sufficient set of social features for our user, already available via API; <br>  - Twitter account has enough anonymity, but not too much. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/365/1d2/5aa/3651d25aa582c69ee6388340b66d6130.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/16a/5f8/364/16a5f836462fc715453a18d74c7c4357.png"><br><br><h4>  This has already been on Twitter! </h4><br>  Indeed, in earlier versions of Twitter, it was possible to open a map on which there were tweets.  At that time, there were so few tweets on the map that the function was quickly cut out and summarized that the people were not yet ripe for real geo-based communication.  Many years have passed - we believe that now it is time! <br><br><h4>  Updates and future plans </h4><br>  We really wanted to roll out the first version in the AppStore, so we simply didn‚Äôt have time to implement many useful things.  We have a lot of ideas how to expand the functionality of the application, without polluting the concise interface that our users like so much.  Very soon you will see everything yourself :) <br><br><h4>  Price policy </h4><br>  At first, we made the application paid to protect against the influx of a large number of active users.  This allowed us to fix a number of critical bugs without much noise, working closely with each of the clients who had problems.  In the future, the application will become more accessible, and now we have a temporary distribution. <br><br>  We are extremely interested in the opinions of users on the implemented functions, write to us in the comments or on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/meetweet_app">twitter.com/meetweet_app</a> or email, there is on the site <a href="http://meetweetapp.com/">meetweetapp.com</a> . <br><br>  And we are very proud of the gallery that we got.  This is still only the first version, but it already has something to look at :) To get to the gallery, just click on the link Twitpic or Instagram, or in the user name - to open his latest photos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/db5/fcb/e86/db5fcbe864fd5ac980d68ab092f6ec5a.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/ac3/882/376/ac388237611393d931db5f8d39a078ba.png"><br><br>  And finally - the sweetest: we do not just publish an article on Habr√© today.  Today we decided to make you happy and at the same time test the strength of the Twitter server and arranged a FREE distribution of Meetweet.
