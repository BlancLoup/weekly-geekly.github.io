Now Microsoft is developing its own corporate messenger, called Skype Teams. <br><br>  The new platform is likely to be part of the Skype brand.  Skype Teams is positioned as a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-skype-teams-slack-2016-9">messenger for teams</a> , and there are quite a lot of features similar to those that have long been familiar to Slack users.  For example, users of Skype Teams will be able to communicate in various groups, called ‚Äúchannels‚Äù.  Direct communication can be carried out using direct messages. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The fact that Microsoft plans to acquire Slack for $ 8 billion, it became known in March of this year.  But the transaction was not carried out, since Bill Gates ordered to begin work on improving the existing and adding new features to Skype.  It was on the basis of this VoIP-messenger that it was decided to create a new corporate product.  Actually, Microsoft already has something to offer to corporations: these are Yammer, Skype for Business, Office 365 and OneDrive for Business, as well as some other services and applications.  Microsoft does not plan to stop on this, preferring to create its own corporate instant messenger rather than buy an existing one.

      Skype Teams differs from Slack in a number of functions.  For example, there is a function of related conversations (Threaded Conversations).  Slack does not have this option, although it would be nice for the developers of this messenger to provide something similar.  Threaded Conversations works simply: any user can reply to a message in the channel by clicking on the answer button.  Other users / users can join the conversation in a manner similar to how it is organized in Facebook and Disqus Comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/92a/828/5d6/92a8285d676e30d8d33e84fe041d5082.png" alt="Images on request &amp; quot; skype Teams &amp; quot;" width="850"><br><br>  Of course, Microsoft developers plan to use the basic functions of Skype in the new messenger.  For example, it will be possible to call someone directly from the channel or to talk privately.  Microsoft even provided for the possibility of scheduling online meetings, which can be useful for large teams. <br><br>  Skype Teams users can share files, records and other materials.  This, however, does not surprise anyone - in most instant messengers there is something similar.  But the makers of Skype Teams improve these basic functions in their product.  In addition, there is a possibility that Microsoft may allow working with bots from the Bot Framework for Skype Teams.  Plus, the service will be integrated with Office 365 and OneDrive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec0/af5/d31/ec0af5d31949f5da9f07d2b0e5dec763.png" width="850"><br><br>  There is an entertainment component.  Microsoft will add the ability to work with emoji, giphy from Giphy, Memes and many others. <br><br>  In the Skype Teams application, a taskbar will be available for quick access to the main functions of the service.  Among other elements there will be such sections as an activity tab with access to the latest notifications, a chat tab, with access to the latest messages and conversations.  The user can also work with the commands tab to switch between different teams and the meetings tab with the ability to create a meeting schedule.  The last is a file tab where you can access all the files of the Skype Teams application and OneDrive. <br><br>  As far as can be judged, the organization of work in Skype Teams will be similar to the organization of work in Slack.  Familiar interface elements, functions, terms - all this implies a painless migration from Slack to Skype Teams.  Since the Microsoft platform has a number of features that Slack does not have (the same integration with Office 365), it may well be that some of the current Slack corporate users decide to start working with a new product. <br><br>  Skype Teams will be available for all devices, including desktop PCs and mobile phones.  Among the supported mobile OSes are Android, iOS and Windows Phone. <br><br>  The beta version of the service is ready and is being tested inside the corporation.  The release date for Skype Teams is still unknown. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/83e/770/662/83e7706621be41890be1eb636eed9db4.png" width="850"><br><br>  Corporate Slack Messenger launched in test mode in August 2013.  The release took place on February 12, 2014.  On the very first day of launch, the service received 8 thousand corporate users.  Slack now has more than 2 million active users, of which 675,000 people are those who pay for a number of additional features of this service.  According to the company itself, 1.1 million users use Slack daily.  At the same time, recently, Slack developers have introduced a voice call feature, planning to add video calls soon.  This is the fastest growing business application in history. <br><br>  In Slack, two paid tariffs are $ 6.67 (Standard) and $ 12.5 (Plus) per user per month.  Payment under the tariff removes some restrictions (for example, a search in the archive up to 10 thousand messages).  Paid users have additional options for managing access rights. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369649/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369649/</a></p>
