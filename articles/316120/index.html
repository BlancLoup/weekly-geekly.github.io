But some of the toys shown in the series already exist in the embryo stage.  The following are 6 products that can give some insight into the future, which has already lurked behind the doors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/peeple-3">Peeple</a> </h3><br>  <b>Give a rating to the person (no joke).</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/895/de5/151/895de5151c0675fadca31b94688c388d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The <b>Peeple</b> app is a <b>bit</b> like the first episode of the third season of The Mirror.  You can appreciate the people you encounter every day in the process of professional activity, in person meetings and on dates.  Although the focus of the application has changed since it was launched, an earlier version was adopted in the technical community without enthusiasm.  And, despite the fact that the reality described in the Black Mirror will not soon become widespread, it is interesting (and even a little joyful) to see how users reacted to the appearance of an application that could potentially perpetuate trolling and network attacks (although they created an application for such a purpose).

    <h3>  2. <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/magic-leap">Magic Leap</a> </h3><br>  <b>Lightweight device that fulfills dreams</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e13/7f8/0e6/e137f80e6b997bf08a4a1b4d4d94a840.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Magic Leap is</b> reminiscent of people in nursing homes who spend 5 hours a week in San Junipero, a virtual reality that feels like real.  This technology embodies some magic tricks from the Mirror.  Earlier this year, the company (based in Florida) collected $ 793, $ 5 million in the ‚ÄúC‚Äù round (!!!) without even releasing a beta version of its product.  This only shows that everyone expects that virtual reality will be so awesome that they are ready to bring its coming closer with all their might. <br><br><h3>  3. <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/microsoft-hololens">Microsoft Hololens</a> </h3><br>  <b>Augmented Reality Headset</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/224/362/44a/22436244a0cf8808136e2989503afd1f.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, companies like Magic Leap are not the only players in the world of augmented or virtual reality.  Not surprisingly, Microsoft has a huge team working on augmented reality technology.  Their latest development?  <b>Microsoft Hololens</b> .  As in the Black Mirror, this headset is an indicator of the rapidly disappearing line between digital and real life.  It can change the way we think, create, and communicate.  We are not waiting for people to integrate such technologies into everyday processes. <br><br><h3>  4. <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/spectacles">Snapchat glasses</a> </h3><br>  <b>Snapchat glasses with integrated camera.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d3/1df/6c1/6d31df6c1bc136f3e6bc5375127c0ce8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In ‚ÄúThe Complete Story of You‚Äù - the third series of the first season, the characters record and lose all their memories through the built-in contact lenses called ‚Äúmini-implants‚Äù.  Glasses are a variation of this concept, created by the Snapchat team.  You can shoot up to 30 seconds of video (in 10-second increments), which displays what you see with your own eyes.  Then you can wirelessly transfer frames to the Snapchat memory.  If you once thought: ‚ÄúIt is a pity that I can not capture this moment‚Äù - then this technology just fulfills such dreams. <br><br><h3>  5. <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/tech/chatlike-me">ChatLikeMe</a> </h3><br>  <b>Create a bot on Twitter, which posts just like you.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fff/19c/6e8/fff19c6e893d0bec8c0b349e44ad6d5f.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  The first series of the second season tells the eerie story of a young couple, whose life has changed dramatically after the accident in which her husband died.  The wife, mourning the death of her beloved, begins to use an online service that allows you to communicate with the dead.  First through e-mail, then with a physical clone, she continues the relationship with a person who no longer exists.  While <b>ChatLike.me</b> does not look like this creepy service, it is still a variant of artificial ‚Äúpersonal development‚Äù.  You simply enter your login on Twitter, and a tape of automatically generated messages immediately appears in your style.  Interesting  :) <br><br><h3>  6. <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/pact">Pact</a> </h3><br>  <b>Earn, doing sports and leading a healthy lifestyle.</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d14/b6a/c79/d14b6ac7943e345a94beaba5a9f5eb0d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The <b>Pact</b> app is a reference to the Fifteen Million Awards Series (1st season, 2nd series), where almost everything in the real world takes place in the form of a game.  In this world, people for their actions receive currency - "awards".  What is the worst thing?  All everyday activities are interrupted by ads that cannot be ignored or missed without penalties (in other words, the worst nightmare of a TV lover).  Fortunately, Pact is committed to a more positive result than the final of the Black Mirror series.  You will pay real money for the application, and the question will be not to lose this money, but not to earn something.  Those who lead a healthy lifestyle are paid by those who do not do it ... and this is certainly an interesting incentive to encourage people to eat healthy foods and play sports.  Try it - the result may surprise you. <br><br>  We also recommend the <a href="https://theringer.com/when-will-these-black-mirror-technologies-actually-exist-4b6837e7c5e0">article</a> The Ringer on the possibility of technical implementation of some developments from the Black Mirror.  Some may not soon appear in our lives, and some technologies either have already appeared, or will appear within the next five years! <br><br>  Original: <a href="https://medium.com/product-hunt/black-mirror-tech-thats-already-here-286144581ea4">Black Mirror Tech That's Already Here!</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/316120/">https://habr.com/ru/post/316120/</a></p>
