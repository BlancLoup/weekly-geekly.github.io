  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Using Kontact and Google Apps</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2007/10/23/gmail-gets-imap/" title="The announcement of adding IMAP to GMail on DownloadSquad">, support for the IMAP protocol has</a> been <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2007/10/23/gmail-gets-imap/" title="The announcement of adding IMAP to GMail on DownloadSquad">added</a> to GMail, which allows third-party mail programs to work with this powerful mail service.  And Google, in a friendly way, shared instructions on how to set up IMAP in various email clients, but forgot about one - KMail.  This is a mail client program that is part of a KDE project and is often used with other KDE programs in Kontact‚Äôs smart personal information manager.  Google also forgot to mention that some of their services, like Google Calendar and Google Reader, can now also work with Kontact. <a name="habracut"></a>  Here is how you can customize them. <br><br><h3>  Mail: KMail and GMail </h3><br>  Let's start with KMail.  Open <em>Settings -&gt; Configure KMail ...</em> , select the <strong>Accounts</strong> tab on the left, on the right, on the <em>Receive</em> tab, click <strong>Add ...</strong> to create an incoming mail account.  Select IMAP as account type.  Enter some name for this account (I wrote ‚ÄúGMail‚Äù), imap.gmail.com as the address of the <em>outgoing Mail Server</em> , port number - 993, your gmail address as the <em>Account name</em> (for example, johnsmith@gmail.com ) and your password.  Switch to the <em>Security</em> tab and check the box next to "Use SSL for secure mail delivery."  Click OK and go to the <em>Shipping</em> tab.  Again, click <strong>Add ...</strong> and in the create dialog box, enter the Account <em>Name</em> , smtp.gmail.com as the address of the outgoing mail server and 465 for the port number.  Encryption method specify <strong>SSL</strong> .  Switch to the <em>Advanced</em> tab and, ticking the <em>Server requires authentication</em> box, enter your gmail address as your <em>Account Name</em> and your password.  Also verify that <em>Authorization Method is</em> set to <strong>PLAIN</strong> .  Done! <br>  Now KMail will go into your GMail account and all your shortcuts will be visible inside [Gmail] (or the folder you chose when you created your inbox account).  You may also want to synchronize your KMail basket with the GMail basket.  To do this, open Settings <em>-&gt; Configure KMail ...</em> , select the <strong>Accounts</strong> tab <strong>,</strong> and set up a Gmail account.  Change the ‚ÄúRecycle Bin‚Äù to [YOUR NAME OF GMAIL] / [Gmail] / Trash. <br><br><h3>  Calendars: Google Calendar and KOrganizer </h3><br>  When you have finished setting up your email client, you can immediately proceed to your calendar.  Unfortunately, Google has not officially announced two-way synchronization with the Google Calendar, however, you can still use your KOrganizer (Calendar component in Kontact) with Google Calendar if you use Java runtime environment and <a href="http://gcaldaemon.sourceforge.net/">GCALDaemon</a> .  Download a zip archive from <a href="http://gcaldaemon.sourceforge.net/download.html">GCALDaemon</a> for Unix / Linux / AIX / Mac OS X systems.  Extract the contents of the archive to / usr / local / sbin (you will need root privileges) and give all users permissions to access the daemon using the command chmod <code>777 /usr/local/sbin/GCALDaemon</code> .  Then run <strong>/usr/local/sbin/GCALDaemon/bin/standalone-start.sh</strong> (you can add this script to autorun by making a shortcut to it in ~ / .kde / Autostart /). <br>  Now you need to know the private address of your iCal file.  To do this, open Google Calendar and go to <em>Settings -&gt; Calendars -&gt; My Calendars</em> and select your calendar.  Then click on the green iCal button below.  Create a new calendar in KOrganizer.  To do this, go to the <strong><em>Calendar</em></strong> tab and click the <strong>Add</strong> button in the <em>Sources</em> panel, select <em>Calendar in the network file (Access to the calendar in the network file accessible via the KIO protocol)</em> , give it a <em>Name</em> (eg My Calendar), and copy the private URL in the fields <em>Upload from</em> and <em>Post to</em> - but replace http://www.google.com with http: // localhost: 9090.  Click <strong>OK</strong> and your calendar should load.  When you are prompted for your username and password, enter your gmail address (eg johnsmith@gmail.com) and password. <br>  KOrganizer and Google Calendar work quite well together except for one thing: if you delete an event in Google Calendar, it will not be removed in your KOrganizer calendar, and vice versa.

    <h3>  News Feeds: Akregator and Google Reader </h3><br>  Unlike the first two, in Google Reader there is no means to synchronize read and unread articles with third-party applications.  However, the migration from Google Reader to Akregator - a component for reading RSS feeds in Kontact - goes completely unnoticed.  Save your list of news feeds to a file by following the link https://www.google.com/reader/subscriptions/export, then open the News Feed component in Kontact, select <em>File -&gt; Import List ...</em> , and select the saved file.  Give your list a <em>name</em> (eg. Google Reader), click <strong>Ok</strong> and wait until the import is complete.  Now all your lists of news feeds will be displayed in Akregator. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  After these steps, Kontact can easily manage all your information from Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Reader.  In the future, opportunities will increase.  GCALDaemon has the ability to sync contacts via LDAP, but it doesn‚Äôt work with Gmail version 2.0 yet.  However, it is <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/exclusive-lifehacker-interview/gmail-product-manager-on-imap-and-greasemonkey-323954.php">likely that native LDAP support will appear soon</a> .  It may be easier to synchronize Google Calendar with KOrganizer with time, certainly not without Google help.  And in the end, maybe Google will update Google Reader to sync with third-party clients, such as Akregator.  Time to become a KDE and Google user. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion from the translator </h4><br>  At the time of this writing (December 4, 2007), the KDE4 project was only in the plans, so now it‚Äôs hard to say whether the above synchronization scheme with Google Calendar works or not, and whether there are simpler options.  However, the fact that the KDE4 project has the potential to create such inconspicuous integration and full synchronization is an indisputable fact.  How?  Recall <a href="http://welinux.ru/post/857/">one of the pillars on which KDE4 holds - Akonadi</a> .  Yes, it is this centralized repository, which is designed to facilitate the setup of programs for various sources of information.  Why, then, cannot we say with certainty that Google Calendar can already work through Akonadi?  At least because I didn‚Äôt try it out elementary.  I have never used Google Calendar, so there‚Äôs nothing to synchronize my KOrganizer with and why.  In addition, according to the developers of Akonadi themselves, so far they are just beginning their triumphal procession - in KDE 4.3 it does not play a big role, since almost no applications use it.  With the release of version 4.4, it is planned to use Akonadi in the Address Book component, and in 4.5 - most of the other programs.  Therefore, I can only advise you to switch to using KDE4 (if you haven‚Äôt already done this), or if you are an avid GNOME user, write letters to the developers so that they get to the attention of integrating with Akonadi as soon as possible - it is not linked to KDE, it was created for use in different environments and has bindings to different programming languages. <br><br>  <em>This is a cross post <a href="http://textranslate.ru/archives/ispolzovanie-kontact-i-prilozhenij-google">translation from my blog</a> .</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72625/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72625/</a></p>
