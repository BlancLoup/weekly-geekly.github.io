  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rambler hackfest '08 ended</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h2>  A bit of history </h2>  The numbers on April 8, I don‚Äôt remember from which tip I came across a <a href="http://hackfest.rambler.ru/">site</a> dedicated to the contest. <br>  The bottom line was to develop a ‚Äústartup‚Äù in 24 hours.  It was necessary only to leave a request in which it was necessary to describe the team, show the work done and suggested to indicate the topic that I would like to perform.  Looked at the <a href="http://hackfest.rambler.ru/winners/">list of the jury</a> except Sysoev and Shitov did not find familiar names).  Without hesitation, I left the application calling the team "Realistic Group". <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Selection </h2>  Applications submitted 120 teams.  Though it was planned to allow about 24, 60 were selected. On Saturday, exactly at 12, the competition starts.  The leader of the team was offered a choice of two topics, one of which needed to be sent to the organizing committee within 13 minutes and, if confirmed, set to work.  On Friday night, I received confirmation of participation and team number - # 48. <br><br><h2>  Start </h2>  On Saturday, at 12 o'clock, I visited the coveted site of the competition for topics :).  I came across topics entertainment service for mobile platforms and information and reference services using UGC.  Naturally, at 12, the whole team was asleep and the decision remained with me).  Since I have absolutely no way with mobile platforms, I began to look for what UGC is.  Googled "User Generated Content" and for some reason the answers were immediately remembered. Mail.ru))))).  Since I didn‚Äôt have much time, I wrote that we would do something like email responses and received a go-ahead.  Over the next half hour, he made a ‚Äúdesign‚Äù framework (now it is exactly the same), which was not changed later) The rest of the team woke up, I called the topic for them, didn‚Äôt seem to swear much).

    <h2>  Competition </h2>  Well, as we wrote the whole thing, whether it will be interesting to someone, I can only say that we are separated by distance, I live in the Yaroslavl region, and the rest in Moscow, but since we have been working together for 3 years, no problems have arisen, and We don‚Äôt have any familiar designers, so they also immediately scored on ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù. <br><br>  According to the regulations, the source code had to be compiled into a specially provided svn.  Svn is still open for reading, who need help, please).  From time to time I studied the contents of the svna, only we and the team # 43 actively commit.  The projects were written in symphony, zend√©, django, katalist, just on pkhp and pearl, there was a project on the drupal which was then smoothly transferred to xoops (as far as I understood from the samples).  There were some more Java for mobile platforms and an action script.  We traditionally did everything on Ruby on Rails.  The design contained only one picture, but there was an opportunity to upload avatars. <br><br>  It seems that they wrote something at 6 in the morning, when almost everything was ready, they argued for a long time who would be doing the categories I or Zhenya.  There was no power ... Zhenya did it all the same.  After that, the implementation of the choice of categories <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_hackfest/16851.html">will be positively noted</a> in his ‚Äúresolution‚Äù by Andrey Shitov.  By the way, the choice of categories is still a bit buggy), but IMHO made it great! <br><br><h2>  Waiting for results </h2>  After the last commit, I simply couldn‚Äôt sleep) Immediately there were unpleasant bugs.  They decided to deploy the project at home - we fall during registration.  It turned out that the method of sending the letter was not indicated in the config, thanks to the jury allowed to fix it (according to the regulations, the latest version of the original version is allowed to be deployed).  Then we found shoals in the layout, a buggy admin panel, a bunch of xss glitches with pages, adding categories with letters in a large register in the name ... The jury did not notice quite a lot of errors (in the rail log everything is perfectly visible;).  In order to slightly weigh the jury I added avatars to them, I hope they liked it).  And the most annoying thing is that all the mistakes were ‚Äúsingle-line‚Äù ... The jury found many more mistakes than we did))).  At first there were a couple of test posts and it seemed to be ok, and then ... They broke our poor layout as best they could, entered impossible tags, many letters without a space, found xss, and ... in general, we didn‚Äôt expect a prize =).  Of course there were no injections (it‚Äôs problematic to get them on the rails).  It remained to rely on completeness, "functionality" and the bugs of other participants. <br><br>  I looked at other teams, half of the front didn‚Äôt have anything except ‚Äútest.txt‚Äù, later other commands disappeared as their project turned out to be inoperable.  As a result, there are 24 of us left, right according to the regulations) <br><br><h2>  results </h2>  I understand, I tired, so I will immediately voice the places with prizes: <br>  1. Humane Magica <a href="http://game.humanemagica.com/">Project in Danger</a> , Django, Runner‚Äôs MacBook Pro Prize <br>  2. Realistic Group <a href="http://hf.realisticgroup.com/">Responses</a> , Ruby on Rails, the prize "hosting light for a year" from the masterhost <br>  3. Web Development Studio by Mikhail Kechinov, Mobile Social Network, php <br>  4. Adept Team, "Around the World", was developed on Adept (php) <br>  5. Vladimir Sergeev and Oleg Sitkin, <a href="http://eventman.pythondevside.com/">My Everything</a> , Django <br><br>  The first two teams shared only 2 points.  (abidnooooo =) <br>  The last three teams won Bitrix Business licenses.  I don‚Äôt give links, because I didn‚Äôt find = (. It seems that somewhere in the community (link below) were. If they post in comments, I‚Äôll add them. <br><br><h2>  Epilogue </h2>  I don‚Äôt know what goals Rambler pursued, but for us this competition meant showing ourselves and proving to ourselves and, if possible, to the rest, what we can invent and do, and quickly projects (the secondary task was to win the laptop instead of the outdated Zhenya Paverbuk and advertising Rails =).  What what, and we showed ourselves exactly).  Lesha and Zhenya got to the RIT conference, the announcement of the results and attracted such good attention to both themselves and the Realistic). <br>  Thanks to the Rambler for the contest, and to the sponsors for the gifts, it is important to remember that the main thing is not victory, but participation) <br><br>  ZY  Unfortunately, the team # 43 took only 11 place.  She had a great project that ranked first without any problems, but the server fell and some judges were forced to put zeros, because the uplift did not happen = (. I really want to see their project in action =) <br><br>  links to the topic: <br>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_hackfest/">The community</a> there is a lot of interesting information and not so much) <br><br>  ZZY  Second answers. Mail.ru (or google.ru, as you wish), our project will not.  We decided to move in a slightly different direction, I hope we will succeed).  I wish the first team the same idea, they have a good, but quickly annoying, we need to develop! <br><br>  Thanks for attention. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23544/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23544/</a></p>
