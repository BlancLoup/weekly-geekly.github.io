  <section class="page js-page"><h1>It's good</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One African king had a close friend with whom he grew up.  This friend, considering any situation that has ever happened in his life, be it positive or negative, had a habit of saying: ‚ÄúThis is good!‚Äù <br><br>  Once the king was on the hunt.  A friend used to prepare and load rifles for the king.  Obviously, he did something wrong, preparing one of the guns.  When the king took his gun from his friend and fired from him, his thumb was torn off.  Investigating the situation, a friend, as usual, said: ‚ÄúThis is good!‚Äù The king replied: ‚ÄúNo, this is not good!‚Äù, And ordered his friend to be sent to prison. <br><br>  About a year passed, the king was hunting in an area in which he could, in his opinion, be completely fearless.  But cannibals captured him and brought him to his village along with everyone else.  They tied his hands, dragged a bunch of firewood, installed a pillar and tied the king to a pillar.  When they came closer to make a fire, they noticed that the king lacked a thumb on his hand.  Because of their superstition, they never ate the one who had inferiority in the body.  Having untied the king, they let him go.

      Returning home, he remembered the case when he lost his finger, and felt remorse for his treatment with a friend.  He immediately went to prison to talk to him. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou were right,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit was good that I was left without a finger.‚Äù <br><br>  And he told everything that just happened to him. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI am very sorry I put you in jail, that was bad for me.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said his friend, ‚Äúthis is good!‚Äù <br><br>  - What are you saying?  Is it good that I put my friend in jail for a whole year? <br><br>  - If I had not been in prison, I would have been there with you. <br><br>  ¬© <a href="http://slip.mmm-tasty.ru/">slip.mmm-tasty.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8871/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8871/</a></p>
