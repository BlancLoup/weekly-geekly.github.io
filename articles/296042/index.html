  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Aggressive sales strategies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Aggressive sales strategies are usually not approved in the modern business world, but there is a time and place to use them, when they are effective, to close a deal.  They have a bad reputation, but sometimes they are the best option to close a deal. <br><br>  For sellers, it is very important to understand when and where they can be used, and when it is impossible. <br>  If you use them at the wrong time or with the wrong client, you may lose the deal, but sometimes this may be your best bet.  Without a doubt, this is a risky decision, but it can be several times more efficient than other solutions. <br><br>  Three aggressive strategies for successfully closing a deal when properly used are presented below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1) Time limit</b> <br>  Sometimes your customers need a little push to make a decision in a timely manner.  Increasing the pressure and putting a time limit on the validity of your proposal can give you in the end the results you want to get.  This should be done so that your customers believe that they receive less money or lose great opportunities if they do not act quickly. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      This strategy assumes that the client needs to be told that he has a certain time frame for making a decision and that your proposal may be changed after a certain date; <br>  Tell the customer that this may negatively affect his goals, which he wants to achieve with your product if he does not complete the transaction on a certain day; <br>  Or increase the competitive aspect by telling the customer that he can get an advantage if he gets your product or service earlier than his competitors. <br><br>  <u>Here is how it might look in practice:</u> <br>  <b>Client:</b> ‚ÄúI'm not sure I'm ready to make a purchase now.  I need time to think it over. ‚Äù <br>  <b>Seller:</b> ‚ÄúI understand that is why I have to tell you that at this price, I can offer you the goods only until the end of the week.  Therefore, I suggest you take a pause for a couple of days to think and I will contact you at the end of the week, is it convenient? ‚Äù <br><br>  This strategy is best used as a buyer incentive in the short term.  The more time a customer takes ‚Äúto think about‚Äù, the less chances you have that he will eventually buy.  However, do not use this tactic if you know that your client invests a lot of time and effort in making each purchase decision.  This tactic cannot be used with thoughtful buyers who like to weigh everything. <br><br>  <b>2) Persistent closing</b> <br>  Vendors who quickly surrender in negotiations when they hear the word ‚Äúno‚Äù tend to show lower sales rates than those who behave more aggressively.  Some customers end up paying after the seller continued his pressure and used several closing questions.  Sometimes, when you are persistent enough, you can actually turn ‚Äúno‚Äù into ‚Äúyes‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Client:</b> ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm forced to refuse.‚Äù <br>  <b>Seller:</b> ‚ÄúWhat can I do to change your mind?‚Äù <br><br>  Do not use this aggressive strategy to close the deal if you are not sure of your opponent‚Äôs response, as in response you may hear something different from what you expect and lose the deal.  Do not use this strategy as the main one when closing deals.  But if it seems to you that the client is ready to buy, but doubts in some moments, it is likely that you will be able to overcome these doubts using this strategy. <br><br>  <b>3) Alternatives</b> <br>  This is one of the most aggressive strategies for closing a deal, and it can only be used at the final stage of the sale process, when the client has already shown interest and has chosen a specific version of your product / service, but still doubts to make a deal. <br><br>  With this strategy, you are trying to develop a client‚Äôs fear of losing more than he can get.  To reduce customer costs, you can offer an alternative product / service where there are no elements / characteristics / parameters that interest the customer most; <br><br>  You offer to postpone the signing of the contact, but note what benefits / benefits the client may lose due to the delay; <br>  Or you can offer a less expensive alternative, but explain that it will not fully meet its needs. <br><br>  <u>Example:</u> <br>  <b>Client:</b> ‚ÄúI am interested in products X, Y and Z from your offer, but I do not have that much money to buy it.‚Äù <br>  <b>Seller:</b> ‚ÄúI can reduce the total cost of the transaction due to the fact that I will remove from the list the product X. This offer will suit you?‚Äù <br><br>  Using this aggressive closing strategy can be very difficult and risky.  It should never be your main tactic and should be used only if you are sure that your alternative offers will be rejected by the client. <br><br>  These three aggressive closing strategies can only be effective in certain situations and require a lot of practice and technology for their successful use.  They should not be used as the main option for closing transactions.  Rather, they should be used as one of the last options, after your client-oriented and softer ways of closing the deal did not work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296042/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296042/</a></p>
