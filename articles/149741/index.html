  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Now Facebook really deletes custom photos.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Back in 2009, one of the editors of the resource ArsTechnica conducted a curious experiment, the purpose of which was to find out how soon a number of large social networks are deleting photos uploaded by users from their CDN networks, which the users themselves had time to regret. <br><br>  Facebook, Twitter and Flickr were used as objects for the experiment (MySpace also appeared on the list, but now this network can hardly be considered popular).  It turned out that the most correct in relation to the photos of their users are Flickr and Twitter - the content was removed from the CDN network in just a few seconds and was no longer available via a direct link.  MySpace turned out to be much more sluggish - deleting files on this network took several months, and Facebook was recognized as the most cumbersome - it took about a year to delete, although some commentators reported that even after three years everyone could see their deleted photo ( by direct link). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Fashionable hipster Instagram application, which was bought by Mark Zuckerberg for $ 1 billion, was also subjected to an experiment with photo removal.  In this case, the situation in the new acquisition of Facebook was fundamentally different from its owner company - the photo was marked as deleted by the user and there was no opportunity to view it in a few seconds.  Kevin Systrom, the head of Instagram, nevertheless, honestly noted that sometimes a deleted photo can be cached on Amazon S3 servers and be available for another 24 hours. <br><br>  In February of this year, Facebook employee Frederic Wohlens (Frederic Wolens) admitted in an interview with ArsTechnica that, due to the nature of the file storage service on Facebook, remote content is ‚Äúnot always‚Äù actually marked as inaccessible and remains on servers for quite a long time.  In all likelihood, something has changed in the user content retention policy, and ArsTechnica acknowledged that a number of user-defined photo and photo resource editors that were used in the deletion experiment are indeed no longer available through a direct link.  There is also an official confirmation from the same Volens - now the removal of cached photos from the Facebook CDN will take up a maximum of 30 days, which allows us to hope for a more accurate handling of the user's privacy in the future.
