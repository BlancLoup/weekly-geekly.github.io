      I was an Apple fan and Mac user for most of my adult life.  I bought my first Mac in 1992 and since then owned another half a dozen.  I wrote for Mac magazines in the mid-1990s.  I waited many hours online when the iPhone appeared and was writing this post on the MacBook Air which I bought without even seeing it live last year, right after Jobsnote‚Äôs talk. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, after yesterday‚Äôs report, which didn‚Äôt shine, I‚Äôm convinced that the Internet is slowly washing out Apple‚Äôs PR magic.  They (Apple) are still making good progress, but times are changing.  Here are 3 reasons why Apple may not make a revolution, similar to what they did before.  Useful material for PR-professionals. <br><br>  <b>1) Bloggers</b> <br><br>  Previously, Apple firmly kept his mouth shut about upcoming updates.  Steve Jobs has built a culture that eliminates information leaks since his return in 1996.  Today, with eyes everywhere and manufacturing in China, it is no longer so easy to do. <br><br>  Bloggers are better and better write-guess exactly what products are coming.  Professional journalists use their posts as a basis, doing additional verification of the facts on their own.  By the time of sending invitations to the press, there is not so much interest and tension left - especially since the debut of the iPhone.  If you think this was the last time that Apple was able to cause shock and sacred awe. <br><br>  What does it mean?  That expectations are great and Apple cannot reach them since the launch of the iPhone. <br><br>  <b>2) The era of "CEO - rock stars"</b> <br><br>  For many years we lived in an era when the CEOs were like rock stars.  Edison, Henry Ford, Jack Welch, Sam Walton, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are all rock stars. <br><br>  Today, ordinary employees and "the same guys like me" are very trusted according to the Edelman Trust Barometer.  This is not an Apple bug, times just change.  The latest CEO scandals did not help.  More importantly, web 2.0 and social networks make individual voices and personal brands more important. <br><br>  Apple still lives in an era when its CEO and his team are the only people who speak for the company.  Compare with Google, for example, who have a whole army of trustworthy people in communities such as Matt Cutts.  Gmail security issue?  Mat will do this.  Is the MacBook on fire?  Write to Steve and pray that he is not too reprehensible. <br><br>  <b>3) Web applications and netbooks eat up Apple cake</b> <br><br>  I am a big web application enthusiast.  I implement 75-90% of my needs through a browser.  I write articles in Google Docs, edit photos in Picnik or Photoshop.com.  The only traditional applications, with the exception of the browser that I still use, are Microsoft Entourage (mail client for Mac OS X) and PowerPoint. <br><br>  Now I am still quite original.  Many of you still love traditional apps, but I think that will change.  In the coming years, you will all be using more web applications.  And this means that a netbook or even a phone will be enough for you.  This area is still evolving and many applications are still version 1.0.  But I think this will change, and if the current economic climate continues, it can reduce the proportion of Apple laptops. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut Apple has its own web applications,‚Äù you say.  "How about Mobile Me and the new iWork.com?"  They are fun, of course.  However, in terms of functionality, they are not in line with Google or Adobe web applications.  And I think that Microsoft products in this area will also be pretty strong.  In the next three years, iLive and iWork should move completely to the cloud (cloud computing) and the one who takes the first step will receive the advantage. <br><br>  This is a look at the situation of one person.
