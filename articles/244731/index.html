      All considered systems have their own (developed within the companies) telematic servers.  For all, it is possible to install them on the servers of customers.  To clarify the specific conditions it is necessary to contact the company-developer.  The important questions are: what resources will be required for this, how easy the system is to maintain and how the update process is organized. <br><br>  There are much more systems on the market, but the ones selected are certainly worth considering when choosing tools for personal monitoring. <br><br>  Perhaps I missed some important points from the point of view of system developers or users.  Hopefully they will appear in the comments. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><br><h3>  WHERE MY MY <a href="http://www.gdemoi.ru/">http://www.gdemoi.ru/</a> (Russia) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06f/c12/05e/06fc1205ed12475783fb049796733c1a.jpg"><br><br>  The company has been working in the telematics market since 2005. <br><br>  Applications for personal monitoring: child minding;  help for the elderly;  care for novice drivers;  active rest, tourism, sport. <br><br>  The range of devices that are connected to the system is quite wide and also includes devices of its own production (which makes it possible to effectively integrate them into the system). <br><br>  In addition to GPS / GLONASS monitoring in the system, it is possible to work with GSM cameras, which in my opinion is also interesting in the field of personal use. <br><br>  Large corporate clients are also offered an option when the software distribution kit is installed on the organization‚Äôs server. <br><br>  <b>Restrictions for free fare</b> : up to 2 objects;  history for 1 day;  3 maps of Russia and the world.  The free tariff plan is available only for trackers (for mobile applications it has become unavailable). <br><br><h4>  Useful features of the system </h4><br><ul><li>  Mapping: 3 providers (out of 10);  traffic traffic (Yandex, ProGorod, Google). </li><li>  Search for a location on the map at.  Geocoder can be selected (Yandex, ProGorod, Google, OpenStreetMap). </li><li>  Geofences: circle, polygon, route.  The route is laid instantly.  At the same time, the corridor, specified at its creation (along the radius), is displayed. </li><li>  Geofences: convenient editing, deletion and display of marked geofences on the map. </li><li>  The ability to display a mini-map. </li><li>  Custom layers can be added to the map (in KML format). </li><li>  The list of objects is easily displayed / hidden on the screen.  By selecting an object in the list, you can see trips and events on it for a specific time interval.  For each object in the list displays its status icon. </li><li>  When you click on an event selected from the list, the location of this event is displayed on the map. </li><li>  Icons of objects on the map vary depending on the state. </li><li>  If the information panel is open (at the bottom of the screen), then when you click on the name of an object on the map (or an object in the list), it displays detailed information about the state of the object. </li><li>  Object dashboard consists of widgets.  If all the widgets do not fit on the screen width, you can scroll left and right, switch places (dragging with the mouse) and hide. </li><li>  You can simultaneously display on the map multiple tracks from the same or different objects.  For each track, speed, mileage and travel time are available on the map. </li><li>  A well-developed alert rule system.  Notification rules can be created for different types of events: start / end of the trip;  entrance / exit from geofence;  over speed;  control deviations from the route;  alarm button;  low battery;  shutdown or loss of communication with the object and others.  The rules set event parameters (permissible speed, battery charge, ...), text and channel (SMS, email) alerts, time schedule (by hours and days of the week) and geofences where alerts should be generated for these events. </li><li>  Directly from the application you can contact technical support. </li></ul><br><h4>  The application for smartphones "NAVIXY Android GPS Tracker" </h4><br>  Key features: <ul><li>  Setting the time and distance after which the location record is formed. </li><li>  Gprs traffic saving mode.

GS Monitoring Online uses dozens of successful companies in Russia and foreign countries that offer GLONASS / GPS monitoring services under their own trademarks. <br><br>  <b>Restrictions for free fare</b> : up to 3 objects;  history for 1 day;  no control of visiting geofences;  There are no operational notifications about events via email or via SMS. <br><br><h4>  Useful features of the system </h4><br><ul><li>  Mapping: Yandex, Google, OpenStreetMap;  traffic traffic (Yandex, Google). </li><li>  Geofences: polygon. </li><li>  Geofences: easy editing, deleting, changing color, displaying marked geofences on the map. </li><li>  A handy tool to add your own POI (Landmarks).  Good set of icons.  This is a kind of round geofence, with a given radius and an icon in the center. </li><li>  The list of objects is easily displayed / hidden on the screen.  By selecting an object from the list, you can quickly look at its history, trips and events for a specific time interval.  For each object in the list, the battery charge and its status icon are displayed. </li><li>  When you click on an event selected from the list, the location of this event is displayed on the map. </li><li>  When you click on an object in the list (or on an object icon on the map), it is centered on the map and an information window opens for it.  Right in it, you can choose a short or detailed information display mode. </li><li>  For each track, speed, mileage and travel time are available on the map.  Tracks can be exported to KML, GPX. </li><li>  An advanced alert rule system is available.  Alert rules can be created for different types of events: SOS;  control of entry and exit from geozones;  battery charge control;  speeding control and others.  The rules set event parameters (permissible speed, battery charge, ...) text and channel (SMS, email) alerts. </li><li>  For the account, you can create additional users (operators).  They can track objects and receive reports, but do not have administrative access to the personal account. </li></ul><br><h4>  The application for smartphones ¬´GPShome Tracker (beta)¬ª </h4><br>  Key features: <ul><li>  Displays the location of the smartphone on the map with data on the current position and the accuracy of the coordinates. </li><li>  Set the frequency of sending location reports during parking. </li><li>  Set the frequency of sending location reports while driving. </li><li>  Prohibition / permission to use GPS localization. </li><li>  Prohibition / permission to use the network localization. </li><li>  The ban on turning off the GPS receiver if the speed is above the set threshold. </li><li>  GPS search time.
