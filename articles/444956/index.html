This is not the author of the post! <br><br><h3>  Introduction </h3><br>  The article is not about electric transport.  Electric bikes live somewhere in neighboring topics. <br>  A colleague of <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/ricoscrewdriver/" class="user_link">RicoScrewdriver</a> published a good article about riding a bike to work.  I take the liberty of writing a similar opus, but from the point of view of a keen katalets, who sees the bike not only as a transport.  Let's just say, this is the opinion of an amateur with an above average meanness. <br><br>  It all started prosaically.  Once, on a warm March afternoon in 2016, somewhere between the convolutions of the brain heated by the first sunbeams, an itch appeared.  I remembered my childhood.  Not everything at all, but those moments when I rode a bicycle.  It was a long time ago and the last years my main transport to work was the train, metro and feet.  And I suggested that my wife buy a bicycle.  So we became the owners of two MTB (in common "mountain") devices such as "Hardtail".  In the beginning there were easy pokatushki around the city and the park "Elk Island".  Each time it was interesting to call in unprecedented corners of the city and the nearest suburb.  Then I did not think that it is so easy to go to work.  But such thoughts once appeared.  I looked at the map, saw ‚ÄúElk Island‚Äù there, he beckoned.  And I succumbed.  Paper cutting was a revelation to me.  Asphalt road in the forest.  So I drove from Korolev to Sokolniki Park, and there it was very close to the Dobryninskaya metro station, where I worked then.  And it began.  Since that time, and thousands of kilometers appeared some experience and opinion, which I will try to share. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What to choose </h3><br>  Bicycle does not happen much.  That you will understand if there is a <b>hobby</b> .  Since here we are considering more the option of riding to work, then you can ignore their specific types, leaving, IMHO, such options:

    <ul><li>  MTB.  T. n.  "Mountain bike.  It happens only with a suspension fork in the front (hardtail), or it may also have a shock absorber for the rear wheel (‚Äútwo-suspension‚Äù).  If on your way there is no insane amount of roots, deep dirt, terrifying type of asphalt, then you do not need it.  If there is only a small area (two, three) with such conditions, then you still do not need it.  Not only that, adequately working shock absorbers (they are of different types) cost quite serious money, they must also be properly serviced.  And this is extra weight, which will be a separate chapter. </li><li>  Highway  It differs from MTB in a different frame geometry, lack of depreciation, and another wheel (ram), which gives a large variation of grip, adding comfort.  His initial element is asphalt roads, but absolutely nothing will happen to him from light and small sections of average off-road. </li><li>  Singlesped, in advanced cases, fix.  Take, if you want to spend a minimum of money, but keep in mind that you should not go too fast on this type, these types have one speed (fixed transmission), take care of your knees.  Fix differs from singlespid lack of free rotation of the wheel separately from the pedals.  That is, if the wheel rotates, then you have to rotate the pedals.  This can be traumatic, especially when going downhill.  From the pluses I see only reduced weight and mechanics of reduced complexity. </li><li>  Bicycle with a planetary sleeve.  A very good option for those who are as easy as possible to drive.  Without trying to achieve some good results.  Lovely is the ‚Äúgearbox‚Äù hidden inside the rear wheel hub, which allows you to switch even while standing still (for example, for an easy start, if you forgot to drop the gear in advance).  No less significant advantage is the simplification of the chain drive.  Only two stars, as on singlespids, more durable and wear-resistant chain.  Reliability, simplicity and extended service intervals.  Sometimes the chain drive can be replaced with a belt drive, which makes it almost impossible to recall the transmission. </li><li>  There are also Grevela, city bikes and hybrids.  The author has practically no experience of riding on these species, therefore, he cannot say anything about them, remains at the mercy of self-study. </li></ul><br><h3>  Weight of bike </h3><br>  And there are a lot of opinions, let's understand.  In principle, the lighter the bike, the better, but there is a certain limit beyond which the price increase for such a device becomes very large, and the weight loss is very small.  Also, many components of the ultralight (and ultra-expensive) class have a limit on the maximum weight of the rider (usually about 70-80 kilograms).  The most important weight of the wheels.  After all, the wheels - this is the flywheel, which you will need to unwind with each acceleration, and you will constantly have these accelerations.  And the lighter this flywheel, the nicer you are.  The weight of the frame and other components is not so important, but, you see, it is rather stupid to have good and light wheels and a ‚Äúcast iron‚Äù, heavy frame.  Everything should be optimal and balanced.  For myself, I consider the optimal MTB weight less than 12 kg and road mass less than 9 kg.  But, I repeat, you should not chase the minimum, especially at the beginning of your cycle path.  It is important to understand that it is not the bike itself that moves.  The system moves from a cyclist and a bicycle.  Their masses are folded, and the bigger it is, the less influence the mass of the bicycle itself has.  Those who think that a bike of 20 kg is not much different from 12 kg will also be wrong.  I have an MTB and a highwayman, so when I sit down between them, I feel a huge difference in dynamism and lightness, of course, not in favor of the first.  And this difference is only about 6 kg, so the summary: do not neglect the weight of the bike, the lighter option will give you more pleasure and comfort, but do not raise it into a cult, remember that the most important is the mass of the wheels, the rest is less valuable. <br><br><h3>  Materials </h3><br>  The most common aluminum alloys and carbon.  If funds allow, then carbon is better, but a normal aluminum frame for beginners will be quite a choice, you shouldn‚Äôt be chasing after carbon, but if you can, it‚Äôs better to pay for it. <br><br><h3>  Manufacturer </h3><br>  Any bicycle brand.  In addition to one - so-called.  "Ashanbayki."  These are bike simulators sold in large chain stores.  They differ from car bikes with a slaughter weight, low reliability (and therefore poor safety) and a small resource of all components.  Do not.  Of course, the possession of well-known (and not very) top brands warms the soul, they are beautiful, reliable, have interesting and useful technical solutions, but they are worth taking if you are not financially constrained and know exactly what you need.  The middle echelon manufacturers are also suitable.  I'm afraid the listing of manufacturers will go beyond the rules of the community. <br><br><h3>  How many speeds?  Why so much? </h3><br>  At the time of the dawn of the 3rd system (three stars in front) the number of speeds in a bike could reach 33. Many, and not quite.  In reality, of this amount, not more than a third is used (usually).  What is important to us?  It is important gear ratio in the transmission.  And in the version with 33 speeds there were many ‚Äúoverlapping‚Äù, almost identical gear ratios, which were almost never used.  In multi-speed transmissions of a bicycle, in normal skating it is not recommended to strongly twist the chain (for example, to put it on the front and rear largest stars) - this leads to increased wear of all transmission elements.  Thus, a few more speeds from our set decrease.  The result is that of the 33 possible installation options for the chain, you can use 8-12 reasonable.  At the moment, I haven‚Äôt seen 3 stars in the front in new bikes, on MTB there is even a tendency to switch to one leading front star, which allows to get rid of the front switch, and on the road bike there are 2 optimal stars so far.  Also, in the top transmission sets, one can more often see 12 speed variants (meaning the number of stars behind).  For MTB, this allows you to increase the range of gear ratios, and for the roadmen to reduce the steps during the transition between the stars (sometimes it happens that the current gear is too high cadence (pedaling frequency), and the next, although lower, is a bit hard to turn).  And also increases the available range of gear ratios, which allows you to go very slowly (with adequate cadence), and very quickly (as far as preparation will allow). <br><br>  Initially, I did not plan to write about the choice of a bicycle, but, seeing the general skating of people on MTB, I could not resist.  Historically, after the fall of the iron curtain on the territory of the ex-USSR, this type of bike was the first to emerge, becoming, a posteriori, the ‚Äúdefault value‚Äù when choosing beginners.  Although, in most cases, not being optimal.  Pay attention to other species.  And, especially, on the road. <br><br><h3>  I want a bike to work, but I do not have a soul! </h3><br>  And I have not.  In this case, helping out washing over the sink and rubbing with a wet towel.  No problem.  If there is a bike rental in your city (or you will be loaned a friend to you), then you can pre-arrange a test period for yourself. <br><br><h3>  clothing </h3><br>  I strongly recommend a specialized cycle form.  In this case, use shorts with the so-called.  "Pampers" - a special tab sewn into the crotch.  Its main purpose is to remove moisture from contact with the skin, which will prevent the appearance of various troubles in the form of rubbing.  The bonus is a light amortization ass.  Overalls are very comfortable, you quickly get used to it, and there is no desire to go back.  Once I went home in jeans.  It was suffering - very uncomfortable after a normal veloform.  And we really need gloves.  Better with full, not cut off fingers.  How many times have I been grateful for my salvation from decent abrasions!  If your hands are sweating in such, then there are well-ventilated, but, nevertheless, full-size models.  I recommend cycling shorts with straps - this is more convenient (nothing slips). <br><br><h3>  Helmet </h3><br>  At one of the crossroads, waiting for the traffic light, the driver of the car asked me about the helmet.  They say why he told me.  I took off and showed scratches on it from small drops, this explanation was enough for him.  We will not speak about high speeds, everything is clear there, wars often go about low, up to 20 km / h.  "I will have time to put up my hands."  You have time.  Expose.  And once, guaranteed, do not have time.  I fell at different speeds, I need a helmet.  By the way, it is supposed to change it after incidents, even if there are no visible damages, but very few people do that. <br><br><h3>  Saddle </h3><br>  First of all, after the first kilometers on a bicycle, many go to the store for a wide, puffy and soft saddle.  Don't do that.  Human anatomy is designed so that our skeleton rests when sitting on the ischial bones.  Wide and soft saddles are only deceptively comfortable.  On them you do not sit on the sciatic bones, but on soft tissues, getting unwanted processes in them that do not lead to anything good. <br><br>  It is necessary to find out the distance between these bones, for which there are different ways, many of which are perfectly shown on YouTube.  It is necessary to add about 20 mm to the obtained value and choose a saddle with approximately the same width.  It should be quite tough, but not "wooden."  And the first week, most likely, you will get used to it, you will probably be quite hurt.  But you take it and sit down, soon everything will be fine and it will be wonderful.  I started this way 3 seasons in a row, and then drove on one of the popular models, and fell in love with her.  Bought, but still not fully rolled.  I recommend to try the saddle with cut, I personally liked it. <br><br><h3>  Ergonomics steering </h3><br>  Steering is direct.  On MTB, I additionally installed horns (though not at the edges, but somewhat closer to the center, but this is my personal choice).  They allowed me to change the grip, because during the trip my hands can flow from a constant position.  And do not put horns vertically - it will be a bad option for your joints of the hand. <br>  The very (usually rubber) lining on the ends of the steering wheel (grips) that you hold onto are also ergonomic - it can be useful if you feel uncomfortable with your hands on standard ones. <br>  Steering ram is usually installed on bicycles, calculated, including, and for high-speed movement.  Usually it is not as wide as a straight line, therefore it allows to reduce the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe frontal projection of a cyclist, affecting aerodynamics.  It has a wider variability grip. <br>  Travelers often love another version of the steering wheel - the butterfly.  Let's just say this is an option when you want a more direct back, but at the same time the broadest possibilities for grip. <br>  There is no better option among them, each is used for its intended purpose. <br><br><h3>  Small things are not small things </h3><br>  Points  I myself bespectacled, so initially forgot to add about them.  3 times in a season, I gratefully remember my glasses, having received a significant blow from the body of an insect to the lens.  Barefoot childhood floats in my memory - then a small midge flew into my eye.  It is very unpleasant and painful!  In general, glasses are needed. <br>  Wings.  If the rain for you is not a barrier to the trip - necessarily.  Otherwise you will be very dirty, especially from behind.  And even if there is no rain.  In Moscow, in the Sokolniki Park in the morning they constantly pour asphalt in the summer.  This is enough for a dirty and wet back.  I am for full-size, permanently installed wings.  They better protect, they stand out less visually (for whom this is important). <br>  Velosvet  In the dark season light is needed.  I have repeatedly traveled around such flying Dutchmen emerging from the darkness a few meters away from me.  Nothing pleasant and very unsafe.  Behind a good, quite bright red signal, and in front a headlight.  Either specialized, or, if on a budget, a lantern.  I use a flashlight, covering part of the lens when approaching the counter.  This is not very correct, and perhaps I will put the headlamp with a normally formed light beam.  Blind oncoming is not good. <br><br><h3>  Landing </h3><br>  It is very important to properly configure the bike for themselves.  There are a lot of materials in the network, I highly recommend reading them. <br><br><h3>  If it gets boring </h3><br>  It seems to me that it is impossible to be in the bicycle community, and not to hear the word Strava.  I did not become an exception, I heard it.  But the first 700 kilometers of my modern bicycle life somehow did without it.  But curiosity overcame.  It turns out that this is a whole world where you can meet like-minded people, socialists, find out who this is so frisky with a whistle overtook you tonight, while you thought that you needed to search faster!  And, sometimes, to meet their fate, yes, girls also use this social network. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">And girls, which is characteristic, can!</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PtNGWAnhDRE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  And not only cyclists, even runners and lovers of other sports.  But most of all I was attracted by the possibility of correspondence competitions.  Strava allows you to record your every trip, not only the GPS track, but also the speed, as well as other parameters, depending on the sensors installed on the bike.  And share them.  Also, anyone can select a section of the path, make it public (or closed - only for themselves), and arrange an extramural competition.  Anyone driving through this section will be entered in a table according to the average speed reached.  Pretty motivating and interesting stuff.  So I met a few good people, made my trips more interesting! <br><br><h3>  Upgrade.  If passion is what you want to improve your bike </h3><br>  My first upgrade was tire replacement.  Initially, my MTB was a regular rubber with a developed tread.  This is good for unstable soils, but those on my way became less and less.  And I put the so-called.  "Poluslik."  This rubber does not have grousers (rubber studs) in the main contact patch area, but has them on the sides, which allows for increased lightness and travel speed on a hard surface, while leaving the opportunity to visit the unpaved path of moderate off-road.  It was a revelation to me!  This is one of my best acquisitions. <br><br>  Then I sat tight in the strava and replaced the bike computer.  The new acquisition allowed me not to use the smartphone to record my pokatushek, and also to get the ability to connect various sensors, since the most interesting thing in cycling is to look at the numbers. <br>  A speed sensor (based on reading the rpm from the wheel) and cadence (pedaling frequency) completed the picture.  The speed, of course, was not new, but the cadence taught me how to pedal correctly (to maintain the health of the knee joints, it is advisable to rotate the pedals at a speed of at least 70 revolutions per minute). <br><br>  Somewhere in the same moment I switched to contact pedals.  This is when a special bicycle is fastened to the so-called.  the thorn allowing rigidly to fasten a foot to a pedal.  By twisting your heel out, you can unfasten it.  Since then, I have not rolled more on classic pedals, since there are too many pluses and few minuses.  This is also an increased efficiency of pedaling (it is possible not only to push the pedal, but also to pull it on the return stroke) and fixing the foot on the pedal, and how many times my leg has been torn off from the usual tramplers!  Yes, in contact shoes before stopping, you need to be quilted, at the beginning of a fall there are (usually at zero speed), but a conditioned reflex appears very quickly.  And sometimes you quit one leg, and you start falling to the side of the other - this is also funny.  But these disadvantages are too insignificant to discard contact pedals from the account. <br><br>  The next upgrade is the most expensive, perhaps unreasonable for the level of MTB that I own, but since my childhood I have a weakness for various servo drives.  In general, the system was installed with an electric gear shift.  This is when between the gear selector on the steering wheel and the switch itself are not wires, but wires.  And switching takes place with an electric servo.  And yes, now I have to sometimes (about once in 1000-1500 km) charge the battery of this system in a bicycle.  But I am very pleased with her work!  Highly!  Everything quickly, clearly, with the ability to automatically switch the front switch, depending on the position of the rear. <br><br>  Next in line was the pulse sensor.  Breast on a belt as they are stable and do not lie.  So I learned to understand my body, see the reactions to the load, and plan them.  If you know your maximum heart rate, with which you can drive 10 minutes (or another time interval), then you can plan a jerk so as not to run out of time ahead of time. <br><br>  The upgrades ended there, but the road bike obsession got into my head.  I bought it in parts for 1.5 years in European bike shops.  At that time, I clearly knew what I wanted, and these Wishlist in their sum did not give me a chance to buy the finished version. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Especially remember the purchase of the frame and wheels.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The best time to buy a bike is winter.  In November 2017, at one of the European online stores, I found quite good bicycle racks.  I made an order and paid.  I waited a few days, finally receiving a letter with regrets about the impossibility to fulfill the order.  It was a fiasco, I had a little quarrel, but, naturally, it did not help.  I got the money back.  Back to rubles.  In double conversion, I lost about 5,000 rubles.  I was angry, very angry, but as time went on, the frame was needed, and in this store there was a discount for an even better frame.  With a creak in my heart I paid for it, and the next day I went to customs clearance at Vnukovo.  Because they sent it by UPS, which is fashionable, fast, but has consequences.  I did not want to pay a customs broker and performed all the procedures myself, enriching our state by several thousand rubles.  A week later, the price of this frame fell by about 300 British pounds.  I was indignant, and with a clouded mind wrote to the store that I was upset.  Not only by the fallen price, but also by their previous joint with re-grading.  In response, I received a letter with a 350 pound coupon for the next purchase, which I did.  It turned out to be a wheel.  Good, nice wheels, which I really like, now they are 2 times more expensive than the amount I gave for them then.  Catch the sales! <br></div></div><br>  Then I realized the urgent need for myself in the power meter.  Knowing the pulse makes it possible to drive a long time, but quickly, with a power meter, the situation is similar.  The meter gives you an understanding of your progress.  In the forehead, compare two races incorrectly.  Too many external factors that affect the final speed (force and direction of the wind, air temperature, microrelief).  How to understand that you are progressing (or regressing)?  Here we will be helped by the power meter, which gives the figure (averaged over the last few seconds) in watts, which the cyclist gives with his feet.  And if your average power gradually increases - there is progress.  Vobschem useful, though quite an expensive toy, but I already mentioned that the main thing is tsiferki? <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Strava and sensors</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  As I wrote, the cycling computer is able to send a log of arrival to Strava.  Including the values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the sensors in time. <br><br>  There are two but: <br><br><ul><li>  The speed is always calculated by GPS, even if there is a sensor that reads the wheel speed, which is more accurate. </li><li>  Strava greatly overstates the power if the power meter is not installed.  That is, it has an algorithm for calculating this value deep in its soul based on indirect data, but direct data from the sensor of the meter gives lower numbers </li></ul><br></div></div><br>  But remember, whatever you do, the phrase ‚ÄúIt never gets easier, you just go faster!‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Food and drink </h3><br>  The food does not make much difference when your pokatushki for short distances, but its role increases, you should move away from the house.  I will not describe the stages of metabolism, I will only say that glucose is needed.  Some of its reserves (in the form of glycogen) are found in the muscles themselves and are used for fast energy production.  Next to the process is connected to the liver, well, at the end of glycogen, and in this repository fat reserves enter the business.  The trouble is that the last process is not fast and there are chances of not having time to get the fuel in the right quantity.  And this is called hypoglycemia (in common Bonk).  I had the pleasure of getting into such a situation, since there was little time left for the house.  Sensations of impermanence of life, hatred for everything, absolute lethargy of any movement, the probability of tunnel vision and misting of consciousness - these are all nice things attached.  We urgently need to eat sweets, so take fast carbohydrates on a long journey.  Good chocolate bars, bananas, nuts, etc. <br>  And water is needed!  When traveling to work (a distance of about 23-24 km), I don‚Äôt take it, but further on it is imperative.  In motion, and in the sun, a person evaporates a lot of moisture, and oh, how it is needed by the whole body, including the knee joints, in which the ‚Äúlubricating‚Äù fluid begins to lose its properties, which is very bad in the long run.  I remember well my trip Korolev - Uglich - Rybinsk (308 km).  The water ended 60 km before Uglich and I suffered.  But I begged the local liter, on which he drove to the city.  But it affected the body, and from Uglich to Rybinsk it was not very good!  Vobschem without water is bad! <br><br><h3>  Tool </h3><br>  For the new season I bought myself an instrumental bottle in the bottle cage.  There is a spare camera, mini pump and montazhki.  Well, not bad to take a special bike multitool.  There are no quick-release axles in my highwayman, so the wheel cannot be removed without a hexagon.  In principle, I consider this a necessary minimum.  Last year I traveled without this kit, which gave me the opportunity to walk along the entire Paper glade to the Moscow Ring Road.  And all would be fine, but my highway tires were damaged, as the hard sides of the rims decently rubbed the ends of the tires, while I rolled the bike with the rear lowered.  Zelo unpleasant, tires are not cheap. <br><br><h3>  Incidents </h3><br>  Sometimes different: <br><br><ul><li>  Once I was driving home.  The speed is about 35, I'm thinking.  I see in front of the girl goes in the same direction.  Added lateral spacing, almost caught up.  And then she makes the wheel to the left, well doing so, confidently, feel the experience.  In principle, everything ended well.  There are no scratches on the girl, me and the bikes, I got the experience of flying and a bunch of conclusions.
