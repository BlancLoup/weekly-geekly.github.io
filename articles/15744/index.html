  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Captain The Kill</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  25 million dollars of the development budget (according to other data - 30 million) did not greatly affect the gameplay and the appearance of Stranglehold.  Whether the services of John Wu were paid at a higher rate, or in the Midway is not good enough, taking into account and accounting controls, but in front of us is a fairly traditional platformer game, which already was.  A comparison with Max Payne, of course, is appropriate, but with two reservations: Remedy should have been located in Hong Kong and originally planned to release her game on the PlayStation ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>All head</strong> <br>  Explicit orientation to console gameplay, however, did not prevent Stranglehold from gaining keyboard control at all.  Of course, it is not forbidden to use a gamepad, but even without it, Captain Yon, nicknamed "Tequila", confidently demonstrates agility. <br>  Dexterity, speed and perseverance - according to these three qualities, as in litmus paper, you can distinguish the console hero from the computer one.  The depth of the plot is replaced by the brightness of the textures, the smoothness of the animation - thousands of surprises and ‚Äúopening‚Äù additions, and instead of the design of the levels we are waited for by a whirl of events, a hurricane of bullets and fireworks of staged scenes.  Even the most primitive game on the PC requires the gamer to turn on the brain, even the most sophisticated and expensive (such as Stranglehold) console can be turned off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cdd/78f/dfc/cdd78fdfcc9e3469acf1d72b438aab02.jpg" width="450" height="336" hspace="10" vspace="10">

      <strong>Beauty by request</strong> <br>  On an empty head to enjoy Stranglehold becomes several orders of magnitude easier.  Just because the game designers are great fellows and real professionals, thoroughly knowing how to make beautiful and interesting.  The main thing - do not argue with them and do not show initiative. <br>  If you look at Stranglehold as an attraction, the design is thought out flawlessly: there is a trolley standing there - you have to fall on it with your belly and roll along the path, in the mode of shooting mock bangsters.  And this is the railing.  They appeal to Captain Tequila invitingly, as if to say: "dear man, run over us like mad, shooting Bosko away at evil bandits." <br>  More rotten supports, fuel barrels, boulders and other excesses scattered here and there, which are chanting to a gamer in the human voice of the design group: ‚Äúshoot us‚Äù, ‚Äúblow us up‚Äù, ‚Äúput us on the damnable bows of ugly bandits‚Äù . <br>  And what?  Can a gangster survive in such a destructive harmony situation?  Especially, the lonely miserable thug dying from any bullet?  Of course not.  Therefore, by the will of the designers, there are a lot of bandits on Captain Tequila.  Lots of. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/3dd/c69/fd3/3ddc69fd3546c24e257bfe2f9419b594.jpg" width="450" height="336" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>It is better to shoot than to drink and talk ...</strong> <br>  Captain Tequila - trump jack.  In addition to the semi-automatic gearbox, which leads a gallant servant of the rule of law into a brown and white word, our hero is able to quickly heal himself, delicately send bullets to the target, fall into divine rage and dance on the tips of the bullets.  On the Xbox 360, the gamepad's spider answered for the skills listed above, and it was duplicated on the PC with 1,2,3 and 4 buttons. <br>  Playing on these numbers as on a button accordion (yes, the melodies clearly repeat, pulling out the smash hits and netlenki), the gamer leads Captain Tequila through all 7 circles of the gangster hell, making short halts during the plot videos and boss fights. <br>  Unfortunately, neither one nor the other can be attributed to the merits of Stranglehold.  The bosses of the levels - they are also the leaders of the mafia clans opposing the captain Tequila - are just fat (in the sense of - long-playing) toads with steep cannons, dying long, artlessly and drearily. <br>  As for the rollers on the engine, woven into the gameplay with a clever narrative purpose, they ... <br>  They are for the most part disgusting.  Horrible character animation.  The horrible grimaces of the main characters.  Tequila itself, frightening it with a self-shaded jaw, or like a small head with a big fire ... <br>  However, the most heartbreaking episode is, of course, the scene in the bar where Captain Tequila drinks tequila.  In the yard in 2007, in the pocket - 30 million budget money and the Unreal Engine 3 beats in Stranglehold chest. But neither the third nor the third prevents Captain Tequila from simply opening his mouth without a hint of lip animation, demonstrate the black hole of a polygonal inside and insert In it the pseudo-liquid foaming by shaders. <br>  Only for this crime against the aesthetics of Stranglehold should I give an Adult Only rating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d9c/540/b5c/d9c540b5c7c7e0544df673e33777af3d.jpg" width="450" height="336" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>Much more than nothing</strong> <br>  If you give a brief description of Stranglehold, then, probably, it will sound like this: a masterpiece in words, not in deeds.  In fact - just a strong, interesting, but a passing game. <br>  7 levels fly by for a maximum of three full evenings spent at the computer.  The game does not require much effort and does not require intellectual tension.  Graphics and technical features are perceived in Stranglehold with pleasure, but without reverence - gamers are unlikely to have something to remember after the final credits. <br>  Nevertheless, it is worth playing Stranglehold, especially to fans of John Woo fighters.  There is everything to dream about: a cool hero, many enemies, violent gunfights with enormous destruction, gorgeous scenes of deaths and murderous ballet in the tradition of Hong Kong cinema. <br>  Play, admire, pass, forget - this is the path of the gamer who imagines himself captain Tequila.
