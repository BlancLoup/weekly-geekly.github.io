      <b>How did it start?</b> <br>  It all started with the fact that "SEOs" do not like.  Ugly sites where you cannot find what you came for, content in the style of ‚Äúa seoshnik came to a bar, a restaurant, cinemas, concerts, entertainment clubs in Moscow, cheaply buy now.‚Äù  In short, everything connected with the so-called ‚Äúoptimization‚Äù was often not aimed at a person, or even at least a little friendly towards him.  Therefore, of course, nobody loves SEOs. <br><br>  However, let's face it: in this situation, the search engines themselves were to blame.  Their algorithm, which showed the user in the issuance of sites on request - missed such sites and even considered them "good", because they were optimized ... for the search robot.  Such a robot will run through the site - see that the keys correspond to the request, and indexes such a site as ‚Äúgood‚Äù, and then shows it to everyone in the issue, although it may be painful to look at it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ac/483/2d5/8ac4832d56689a2b4307fa98b0311d35.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Where is it going?</b>  <b>Nowhere.</b> <br>  The search engines themselves understood that they were ‚Äúworthless‚Äù and began to improve their ranking algorithms, complicating them and bringing them closer to real conditions.  The standoff began SEOs - search engines.  That is, as soon as SEOs found ‚Äúvulnerability‚Äù in the search engine system and were able to ‚Äústuff‚Äù there something like protein into the hollow nuts, only for the search engine again to recognize their site as ‚Äúgood‚Äù, they immediately did it.  In response, search engines complicated their ranking algorithms, negating the previous efforts of SEOs, and then the cycle was repeated, at a new level. <br><br>  Sometimes it was fun.  For example, Google likes to call its updated algorithms beautifully - for example, the last of them appeared - Panda (2011) and Penguin (2012).  Seoshniki, who before these updates diligently bought links on other sites (and this pleasure is not cheap and, moreover, extremely painstaking) - suddenly they were literally pushed out of the galaxy with their sites overnight.  They had to urgently remove the links that they so diligently, as soon as the spider can weave its web, set up on external sites that they carefully select.  And all because before Google considered all the links leading to your site - an indicator of quality. <br><br>  It is not difficult to guess that for every update there is a new way to try to obsessively explain to the search engine that your site is a good one.  However, now it is getting harder and harder.  The entire impressive arsenal that SEO specialists used to have literally melts before our eyes. <br><br>  The essence of the updates comes down to the fact that search engines push webmasters and site owners to one simple idea: you don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúoptimize‚Äù anything too hard.  All that you need from optimization is to sensibly tell about your site, using, of course, a set of keywords - but without fanaticism.  And then - let people come and vote for your site. <br><br>  Vote for our site - happy SEOs?  Bang!  There are many services cheating likes.  You probably also saw these strange vkontaknye and facebook groups with a thousand or one and a half likes, in which there is no life, no comments - no one.  But there are likes. <br><br>  No, that‚Äôs not so, of course - the search engines scratched their heads and came up with something that would not be so easy to ‚Äúfake‚Äù.  Thus, the concept of user behavior (behavioral factors) was introduced, which, in principle, was spoken of earlier, but it became the term of the year in 2013 and will not lose its relevance in 2014 as well. <br><br>  <b>Behavioral factors</b> <br>  Here we have to interrupt our interesting and accessible history to any reader and make a small reservation.  The fact is that an analytics is always tied to any decent site: Yandex Metrika / Liveinternet / GoogleAnalytics / yet-some kind of custom-analytics. <br><br>  This is a system that records who came to the site and where it came from, how long it was there, how many pages it looked, what it was doing.  Do not worry, your data is not there, it has nothing to do with our constant concerns about surveillance (as if we are needed by someone!).  All data is impersonal, but it does give a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhether anyone comes to this site at all and is interested in anything. <br><br>  Forge this data will not work.  In order for the system to record that someone has come to the site, it is necessary that someone comes to the site.  For the sake of justice, at one time it was faked - with the help of special scripts that ran through the pages of the site and "pretended" that they were an interested user.  Search engines quickly came up with an algorithm for how to distinguish a script from a person and cut out bots. <br><br>  Well, since the behavioral factors turned out to be the ‚Äúlast stronghold‚Äù where SEO tools simply could not reach, the search engines found these factors as one of the most important ones that they take into account when ranking the site.  What does it mean?  For users, this means it's time to start rejoicing.  Finally, it seems, the search in the top will show the sites that live people use, which means sites on which convenient content, navigation, beautiful and well-written texts and everything is clear, beautiful and to the point. <br><br>  We can already see the results of this initiative right now - many companies run corporate blogs and try to share something interesting and well written, websites are modified, design and user qualities are improved.  Not lucky.  But those who want to be the best follow this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac7/e1e/d30/ac7e1ed30213c4c85308912b1c4f9383.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>What's next?</b> <br>  Then everything is simple.  If you already have a company website, then you can stay in the top only if you ‚Äúconstantly improve‚Äù it - as the search engines recommend.  If you want to create a new site, then only users will be able to let the search engine know if your site is useful ‚Äî they will come, open, look, click. <br><br>  Two things do not give rest to webmasters now: the difficult to "constantly improve" and - how to start a new site now?  After all, it‚Äôs a vicious circle: there are no users - there are no positive behavioral statistics, and there are no behavioral statistics - there are no users.  And the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù field-based automation now, as we understand it, will in this case practically help nothing. <br><br>  In order for the site to speak to the search engine in the "common language" as soon as possible, the <a href="http://serpclick.ru/">SERPClick</a> service <a href="http://serpclick.ru/">appeared</a> .  This service has nothing to do with the heavy legacy of unpleasant seoshnogo past: first, the service meets the latest requirements of search engines, secondly, the service can not be used if the site is written in a well-optimized language, looks bad and does not attract users of any kind or content. <br><br>  SERPClick is a professional tool for really good sites, which allows you to simulate the necessary minimum set of "correct" behavioral patterns, which are then read by search engines and affect the ranking.  Live users who vote with their ‚Äúclick‚Äù come to the site, the site is ranked higher in the results, more users see it, which means they also come.  Given the latest trends, this is probably the most important way of holding positions for ‚Äúold‚Äù sites and more rapid and ‚Äúhumane‚Äù promotion to the top for new ones. <br><br>  Since other users will surely come to the site following ‚Äúspecially trained‚Äù users, their behavior will also affect the ranking of the site.  That is why <a href="http://serpclick.ru/">SERPClick</a> does not help to bring to the top a useless and well-optimized or some kind of ‚Äúwrecking‚Äù ambiguous website.  This professional tool is only suitable for good and useful sites, which means that the Internet becomes a more friendly place for users, where interesting information can be found quickly and on business. <br><br>  In conclusion, we can add that if SEO or optimization has a future, then this is the future of the creators of an interesting and informative Internet, and here <a href="http://serpclick.ru/">SERPClick</a> goes hand in hand with search engine initiatives in this direction. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223325/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223325/</a></p>
