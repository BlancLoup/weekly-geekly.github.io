  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How litter the top</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is clear that we are literate mega-users of the Runet, we have long known that it‚Äôs not a search for one who gets a visitor to the site, and there will never be any sense of cheap and stupid optimization in terms of obtaining leads and sales.  But‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Often, people in our office call and come to those who desperately need to be first in the TOP and precisely according to the words they brought.  And here begins the saddest thing. <br><br>  I will give a few examples so that it is clear what this is about: <br><ul><li>  the client is a meat factory.  He wants to move on the word "sausages" and "sausage", without even looking at the issue and not thinking that a sane person will not look for where to buy sausage on the Internet.  Maximum - wants to get a recipe for homemade sausages and sausages </li><li>  another patient is a confectionery factory.  He wants to break the TOP for the phrase "production of cookies."  This is just apparently, unaware of them that for this phrase they are looking for equipment to create a workshop, and not a manufacturer. </li><li>  the third one really wants to get high positions on the word ‚Äúfurniture‚Äù, although it produces cabinet furniture, and this word is associated by most people with soft furniture. </li></ul><br>  My task is to explain to the client why he is wrong.  And that he does not always need this TOP.  How not to his customers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To do this, I show them with examples how to throw out garbage and protect search engine users from garbage before issuing a website.

      Parameters a bit: <br><ul><li>  The meaning of the request </li><li>  Possible influx of visitors </li><li>  Geo-dependency </li></ul><br>  By the meaning of the request, I understand what people invest in it and what is contained in this phrase in the issue.  It is very simple to check the keys from the above examples: we look at the output on demand, then in <a href="http://wordstat.yandex.ru/">wordstat.yandex.ru</a> we look at what search engine users put into this concept: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2c4eba11/f39adb3b/45aad89a/04ef8914.jpg"><br><br>  Blue highlights the popularity of keywords in Yandex.  But it turns out, still not everyone knows that this tsiferka is the sum of the impressions of all key phrases containing in this case the word ‚Äúfurniture‚Äù. <br><br>  In fact, the number of key phrases entered, for example, ‚Äúupholstered furniture‚Äù will be significantly smaller.  One can recognize him by such a request to Wordstat: "! Soft! Furniture": <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d0648933/c3be3e5a/837b2825/27f2bae2.jpg"><br><br>  As you can see, only 17920 hits per month for exact match. <br><br>  How, then, based on this figure, count the potential number of visitors? <br><br>  According to statistics, the first place in the issue gives about 10% to 30% of the transitions from the exact frequency.  The scatter is so large due to the fact that these data are averaged and depend on the subject matter and type of request, as well as, actually, on the attractiveness of the link that leads to the site in issue. <br><br>  Relatively speaking, the maximum that we can squeeze out of the word ‚Äúupholstered furniture‚Äù if we are the first all over the world in Yandex is 179200.3 = 5376 visitors per month. <br><br>  And now the most interesting is geo-dependency.  I think everyone has already known for a year that all requests for Yandex are divided into 2 groups - geo-dependent and geo-independent.  According to the first issue varies in all regions defined in Yandex, for the second it is the same everywhere. <br><br>  In order to find out whether a query is geosure dependent or not, you can play around with the region setting in the upper right corner of the issue, or you can just scroll down the page to the end and if we see the phrase ‚ÄúSearch without region‚Äù, we definitely conclude that the query geo-dependent: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a5d36535/27d40787/9c4bceae/2ca90831.jpg"><br><br>  In our example, it turned out that the query ‚Äúupholstered furniture‚Äù is geo-dependent.  This means that the site of the Perm manufacturer is unlikely to be highly ranked in other cities on this request. <br><br>  Although there are exceptions: binding to several regions (up to 7) by correspondence with Yandex moderators (you must have a site in the Ya.Katalog), but you need to convince them that the site is related to these regions (for example, you have representative offices there ). <br><br>  The second exception is weak geo-dependency.  The term conditional: <br><ul><li>  In some regions, there are not many sites on specific topics. </li><li>  There are quite a few sites that are not related to any region or to the "Russia" region. </li><li>  There are requests for which several regions are present in the issue. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3e24e995/972ae89a/ed7a5615/6881257f.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, I almost forgot about another query evaluation parameter: the price of work. <br><br>  So, if we have analyzed the requests for all these signs and I manage to convey my thought about what the website promotion really is, we begin to rebuild its head further, moving away from the positions, numbers on the counters and other things to the most important thing - the goals promotion, methods of receiving visitors and criteria for evaluating its effectiveness. <br><br>  Well, and if he did not understand, he still has to work around for years with the companies of the promoters and understand that you cannot pay a penny and do nothing yourself, get the mountains of gold. <br><br>  About this, if habrovchanam like this topic - in the next article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112754/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112754/</a></p>
