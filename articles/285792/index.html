      The following advantages of education in most Asian countries can be distinguished: <br><br><ul><li>  international standards of learning; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  high academic reputation of Asian universities; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  availability of training and accommodation; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  developed infrastructure; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  simple immigration rules; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  comfortable climatic conditions; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  the possibility of mastering another culture; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  development of language competencies; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  acquisition of skills to work in international teams; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  integration into the foreign scientific and business environment; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  globalization of professional connections and contacts. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Japan</font> </h2><br>  Japan ranks third in the world in science funding and leads in the field of basic scientific research, especially in high technology, biomedicine and robotics.  Among the Japanese, 13 Nobel laureates.  The Ministry of Education is pursuing a policy aimed at increasing the number of foreign students in higher educational institutions of the country up to 300 thousand students.  To this end, the state simplifies visa procedures, improves student living conditions, attracts those who want to learn Japanese, and also helps foreign graduates from Japanese universities in employment. <br><br>  Requirements for future students in different universities may vary.  Sometimes it is required to pass the national single exam or pass the entrance test.  Mandatory conditions for all foreign students - the presence of a certificate of qualification exam in the Japanese language. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/">The University of</a> Tokyo (Tokyo University, Japan) is one of the leading universities in Japan and the Asian world, outstanding political and public figures and scholars, among them fifteen prime ministers of Japan.  Today, about thirty thousand students receiving a bachelor‚Äôs or master‚Äôs degree study there.  Research laboratories on space topics or seismology are conducted in the university‚Äôs research laboratories.  The University of Tokyo is considered one of the most prestigious universities in many areas.  Among its competitors are other universities that before the war were among the Imperial universities, in particular Kyoto University. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en">Kyoto University</a> (Kyoto University, Japan) is known as the alma mater of the first Nobel Prize-winner Hideki Yukawa, who conducted research in the field of physics.  In the future, four graduates were also awarded an outstanding laureate title.  Thanks to the powerful scientific and teaching base, the university has developed and is introducing popular master's programs, which make it possible to significantly improve the level of knowledge in the field of exact sciences and acquire essential professional skills. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/index.html">Osaka University</a> (Osaka University, Japan) was established in 1724.  The educational brand unites two hospitals, five research institutes and twenty-seven schools.  The university has twenty four thousand students. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42f/d12/eff/42fd12eff343436f932f7ec704edf55b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Singapore</font> </h2><br>  The Singapore education system is recognized as one of the most effective in the world.  It is indicative of the fact that Singaporean schoolchildren and students are the winners of many subject Olympiads.  In addition to Singapore universities, more than a dozen of the world's leading universities have opened their branches in this city-state.  The government provides billions in financial investments in the development of the educational sphere. <br><br>  The advantages of studying in Singapore are obvious: studying in English, the British education system, world standards of education that meet the requirements of the modern economy, safety and high quality of life.  Singapore inherited a 12-year secondary education system from the English, so applicants with a diploma of 11 grades must complete a preparatory program or study one course at a Russian university and provide the results of an English proficiency test ( <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/search.php%3Ftags%3DIELTS">IELTS</a> or TOEFL).  Upon admission to the National University of Singapore will need to be tested. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a> (National University of Singapore, Singapore), which was established in 1905.  It is the largest university in the country, both in terms of the number of students and programs of study.  At present, the school is implementing world standards in higher education, paying particular attention to the Asian world.  The university has fourteen faculties that offer a wide range of programs. <br><br>  Education in NUS is based on a modular system.  This system includes features of the British system, such as small groups of students in training, and features of the American system of credits.  Students may, during the first two semesters, engage in electives at different faculties.  It is also possible to study under the double undergraduate degree program: Bachelor of Arts, Social Sciences and Technology;  Bachelor of Arts, Social Sciences and Law, Bachelor of Business and Engineering, and Bachelor of Business and Law. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/index.aspx">Nanyang Technological University</a> (NTU) is the main technological university of Singapore.  It offers a wide range of technological and economic disciplines.  NTU is a founding member of the <a href="http://www.globaltechalliance.org/">World Union of Technological Universities</a> . <br><br>  Its main campus and garden (Yunnan Garden campus) occupies 200 hectares in the southwest of the island.  This is the largest campus in Singapore with 16 buildings for students and a hall for doctoral students.  NTU became the Olympic Village for the first Youth Olympic Games in Singapore in 2010. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">South Korea</font> </h2><br>  The country is one of the world leaders in the number of students among the population.  Now a large-scale reform is underway in South Korea aimed at improving the quality of higher education.  In order to attract foreign students, the government has developed a Global Korea Scholarship (GKS) scholarship program aimed at supporting foreign students studying in Korea. <br><br>  Universities organize exchange programs with foreign educational institutions, hire foreign professors to increase the "coefficient of internationality" and rise in international rankings of universities. <br><br>  In some private universities in South Korea, applicants need only to show the Russian diploma of secondary education and the results of tests of knowledge of the English language ( <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/tests/test-ielts-obshchaya-informatsiya/">IELTS</a> or <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/tests/test-toefl-obshchaya-informatsiya/">TOEFL</a> ).  For admission to state universities, foreign applicants take a single exam along with the citizens of the country and the TOPIK test (Test of Proficiency in Korean). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.kaist.edu/html/en/index.html">Korea Leading Science and Technology Institute or KAIST</a> (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) is the leading educational and research university in South Korea, located in Daejeon.  It was founded by the Korean government in 1971 as the first national scientific, research and technical institute. <br><br>  Since 1971, KAIST has been funded by the state.  Initially, the institution was staffed with a significant number of talented engineers and scientists who received education in the United States.  From the very beginning, emphasis was placed on theoretical and applied research.  Now KAIST is the main center of strategic research projects in South Korea.  Approximately 400 university professors conduct research, collaborating with educational and industrial organizations from around the world.  KAIST offers scholarship and support to international students. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.useoul.edu/">Seoul National University</a> (Seoul National University, SNU) is the largest and most famous university in South Korea, located in Seoul.  The university retained its base after the devastating events of the Korean War; today it is building up its scientific, human and technical potential.  The structure of a higher education institution combines several areas, allowing you to choose one of the master's programs.  The university has twenty-six thousand students. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">China</font> </h2><br>  The government of China is working very seriously and systematically on the prestige of Chinese education: universities receive huge budgets for equipping technical and administrative base, for research and for inviting foreign specialists.  For example, the budget of Peking University is comparable to the Harvard budget.  There are a large number of scholarships for international students, especially for the training programs for teachers of Chinese as a foreign language. <br><br>  Apart from mainland China, it is worth noting the universities of Hong Kong, where the colonial influence of Britain has left a legacy of the popularity of English, so many courses are taught in English, which attracts foreign students.  Five of the nine universities in Hong Kong are among the 200 best universities in the world. <br><br>  In order for you to be accepted for a bachelor's program at a state university of the People's Republic of China, knowledge of Chinese is required, which is confirmed by the HSK certificate (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi), with the exception of English-language programs.  Some of the most prestigious universities additionally require entrance exams.  Anyone can enroll in language courses; there are no special requirements other than attaining 18 years of age and the completion of full secondary school. <br><br>  <a href="http://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a> (Peking University) - also known by the abbreviated name "Baida" - founded in 1898, is the largest university in China, one of the oldest universities in the country.  Its structure includes 30 colleges and 12 faculties.  93 undergraduate, 199 master and 173 doctoral specialties are taught.  The university has 216 research institutes, two engineering research centers have national status.  The local library has more than eight million books and 10 thousand titles of Chinese and foreign magazines.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãbook storages and reading rooms exceeds 50 thousand square meters - it is the largest library in Asia. <br><br>  By the number of professors, scientific leaders of doctoral candidates, academicians of the Academy of Sciences of China, the Academy of Engineering and Technical Sciences and, in fact, the students themselves (there are more than 35,000 here) Peking University ranks first in the country. <br><br>  A large number of foreign students are also studying here.  About two thousand foreigners are permanently accommodated on campus.  40 percent of them are Koreans, the other 60 are citizens of Europe, North America, Australia and Asia. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ust.hk/">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</a> (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology or HKUST) is a public research university located in Hong Kong.  Founded in 1991, it consists of four schools that provide a bachelor's degree in business, engineering, social and human sciences.  According to various ratings, it is among the top three universities in the city, as well as among the best universities in China and Asia. <br><br>  The University of Hong Kong specializes in research in the field of biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, environmental protection and materials science. <br><br>  The School of Science operates the Biotechnology Research Institute, the Central Research Laboratory for Biological Sciences, the William Mong Institute for Nanotechnologies and Sciences, the Center for Characterization and Preparation of Materials, a Research Farm and a Botanical Garden.  The School of Engineering manages the geotechnical centrifuge, the Innovation Laboratory (a joint project of the university and Huawei), the Key Laboratory of Information Technologies (a joint project of the university, the Ministry of Education of China and Microsoft), the center of global and public commitment (supports the university robotics team). <br><br>  Today, China is doing everything possible to become one of the leaders, increasing the pace of development in the field of education. <br><br>  Tsinghua University, China was opened in 1911, currently it has a highly qualified teaching staff, which has its own achievements that have become famous in the scientific world.  The university has twenty-eight thousand students, including citizens of foreign countries who are studying for undergraduate and graduate programs.  In 1952, the university was transformed: law, agriculture, sociology and humanities faculties were removed from its composition and Tsinghua remained a purely technical university.  However, by the end of the 1970s, the school had restored its multi-disciplinary character.  Currently, in most ratings, Tsinghua is called the number one university in China. <br><br>  The list of Asian universities is extensive, we recommend viewing the special ranking of the <a href="http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/asian-university-rankings/2014">QS University Rankings: Asia 2014</a> . <br><br>  Opportunities for master's programs offered by leading world universities make it possible to acquire stable positions in the modern employment market, taking into account the increased requirements for the educational level for certain professions, which include medicine, statistics, psychology and others.  The advantages of obtaining a master's degree are also wage increases, improvement of the professional level, which is an extremely attractive factor for serious employers. <br><br>  Having a master's degree and the right choice of an appropriate program will expand the sphere of communication in the professional sphere, creating new successful contacts that promote self-realization and find the perfect way to be as useful as possible to society. <br><br>  <i>We hope that our article was interesting and useful for you.</i>  <i>Follow the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/education/magistratura-za-rubezhom-stoimost-obucheniya/">following publications</a> .</i> <br><br>  The author of the article is Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285792/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285792/</a></p>
