      To register for testing you can use two options: <br><br>  1. Log on to <a href="http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/register">www.ets.org</a> , create your account, choose the city that suits you, and test center.  Pay for participation in testing with a plastic card MasterCard, Visa or American Express.  As a result, you will receive an identification number for testing, find out the date and time of its holding in the selected center.  This data must be printed. <br><br>  2. Download the registration form on the above site, fill it in and send it by fax or mail to the regional testing center.  Addresses of all centers can also be found on the <a href="https://mygre.ets.org/greweb/action/RegPortal">official website</a> .  You must also send a copy of the payment document. <br><br>  The cost of participation in testing GRE is $ 160, exam in subjects - $ 140.  This amount includes sending test results to 4 universities or to participate in sponsorship programs.  If you need a larger amount, you will need to pay $ 20 for each additional certificate. <br><br>  In Moscow, you can take the GRE General test and the GRE specialized mathematics test (GRE Subject Tests in Mathematics) at an authorized center at: ACET Center (American Center for Education and Testing), Leninsky Prospect, 2, of.  530. <br><br>  Registration is required as soon as possible, but no later than 4 days before the official date of the exam.  It should be noted that the number of available places is limited and it is not worth delaying the registration procedure.  We also recommend passing the GRE test several months before the deadline at the university or business school so that there is time if you need to retake the exam and improve your score.  This can be done no more than once every two months and no more than five times a year. <br><br>  When registering, you must correctly enter your data in accordance with the identity document. <br><br>  <b>Cancellation and reschedule</b> <br><br>  To transfer the date of the GRE exam, you need to contact ETS by phone, fax or email and provide your details (name, date of birth, address, registration number, date of delivery, address of the selected test center and a new date of delivery).  At the time of the transfer date, you should already have a receipt in your hand confirming the payment of the commission for the implementation of this procedure.  The cost of the transfer date is $ 50.  You must do everything you need no later than four days before the originally chosen date of delivery. <br><br>  To cancel a test, the same conditions are preserved as with the transfer date.  If you have time to cancel the exam within the specified time, then you will be returned half of the amount paid earlier for taking part in the exam. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/195/961/ae6/195961ae65e14bafa225e9b040c72584.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>How is the exam</b> <br><br>  On the day of the test, you need to come to the center no later than 30 minutes before the start, be sure to take an identity document with a photo.  Due to heightened security measures, you must sign a confidentiality agreement.  You cannot take any things with you to the testing room, including telephones, food and drinks.  Paper for drafts you will provide.  At the end, nothing can be endured. <br><br>  First, students will be asked to go through the Analytical Writing section, which consists of two essays: Analyze an Argument and Analyze an Issue.  For each task is allocated for 30 minutes.  Then follows the Verbal Reasoning section, which consists of two parts, with 20 questions each.  Students have 30 minutes to complete each part of this section.  In conclusion, you will need to go through the section of Quantitative Reasoning, also implying the implementation of two parts, with 20 tasks each.  Each will be given 35 minutes.  Be careful!  The Analytical Writing section always comes first, while the order of the next two sections may vary.  A total of six sections in the test and after passing the third section, a ten-minute break usually follows. <br><br>  Please note that the GRE exam is adaptive at the level of sections and subsections, that is, the indicators in the first verbal section will determine the level of complexity of the second, and passing the first mathematical section will affect the tasks of the next. <br><br>  As for the <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/ru/News_MBA/detail.php%3FID%3D1417841">score</a> you need, it all depends on the chosen program.  On some there is a clear minimum, on others it is nothing more than a formality.  Usually for humanitarian programs, the result of the verbal part is more important, while on such primordial mathematical disciplines as accounting, they ensure that candidates have high points for the mathematical part.  So try to get a result that will help you find yourself in the school of your dreams! <br><br>  <i>In our next publication we will discuss subject tests - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/tests/gre-subject-test/">GRE Subject</a> .</i>  <i>This is especially true for candidates entering the magistracy for technical, economic and medical specialties.</i>  <i>Follow our next articles.</i> <br><br>  The author of the article is Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375685/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375685/</a></p>
