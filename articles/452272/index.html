  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Girl under the waterfall</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I do not know about you, but I like to learn from people.  Not only those about whom they write in books.  And not so much those who write these books.  I live people working next to me. <br><br>  The beauty is that real people do not try to teach you.  Do not conduct seminars, trainings, do not take money from you.  They just do their job as best they can.  Something they get, there are failures, and failures, and swearing with mats.  But one can learn something from everyone, even if in general a person‚Äôs opinion is negative. <br><br>  I used to work with one girl ‚Äî the best project manager I've ever seen.  In general, our relations with her have always been strained, sometimes turning into open hostility.  For several months she was my boss ‚Äî apparently, therefore, I disliked her for a very long time.  In the last year of my work at that company, it happened that she became my subordinate, also for several months.

      For several years we sat in the same office, and I had the pleasure of observing her projects, the evolution of methods and the growth of managerial competencies.  She most likely did not know that I was observing and learning.  Although, who will understand them, these women - maybe it was she, Machiavelli, and not me. <br><br>  The comments ordered a picture to attract attention to insert.  I perform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h6/9w/rn/h69wrn7a811vh7fxzktv42og2uq.jpeg"><br><br>  She now works as a director of the design department of one of the largest and most famous enterprises in Chelyabinsk.  And I sit and write an article about her. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Short story </h3><br>  When I came to that company as a programmer, the girl worked as an economist.  There were no programmers before me - they worked with outsourcers, therefore there was no IT department.  Three months later, when I showed some results, the experiment with my own programmer was considered successful, and the IT department decided to organize it. <br><br>  For some reason, I was not considered as a manager.  In general, they did not offer, did not announce that they were looking for a leader.  I just learned that there is now an IT department.  And this girl led him.  As it so happened - a mystery covered in darkness. <br><br>  Together we worked for several months, until I went to the director and did not say that it was impossible to go further.  Or me, or she.  Well, it seems like she doesn‚Äôt understand a damn thing about automation, and she only teases my brains with her projects.  And she was able to make the brain. <br><br>  Run away, in short.  I was the only employee of the IT department, and she headed the newly created quality and business processes department.  It was a difficult period for her - she lost her department, back to economists to go not comme il faut, and they say, they say - but get you on the street, since you have nothing to do. <br><br>  Saved her first project.  Just decided to be certified to ISO.  Not as it often happens - to take typical processes, to adapt a bit and get a certificate.  They wanted to seriously, with the reorganization of business processes, full understanding, etc.  In short, such a good project.  Here began her career as a project manager. <br><br><h3>  First project </h3><br>  She completed the project for the implementation of ISO standards quite well.  I must say that at the time of the start of this whole case, she was not in the tooth leg on the topic of ISO. <br><br>  Beginning with standard errors - called consultants.  The first general felt boot turned out to be.  I held a seminar for all the leaders, spoke for the life of something, issued certificates to everyone - they say, we listened to the course, and now we understand something.  Then he was called to the company, they said - well, come on!  Transform us under ISO. <br><br>  He probably did not know what was wanted of him, and answered simply.  He pulled out a pile of papers from his briefcase, dumped them on the table and said: here are the standards, take them and inject them.  This cooperation is over with him. <br><br>  Then there were other consultants.  In general, they came to introduce TOC, but in a conversation it turned out that they understand something in ISO.  We agreed that they would work with our heroine to build one of the processes.  It seems that we decided to start with the supply - it is logical, because  TOC implementation also went into procurement. <br><br>  Carried a couple of months, and left.  Of course, the company believed that the consultants were bad.  Consultants, of course, said that the company was not ready.  TOC is not implemented, the process is not done. <br><br>  Then our girl stamped her foot and said that she would do everything herself.  Not in the sense of ‚Äúdo it yourself‚Äù - she had a woman employee subordinate, maybe even two.  She said that she will figure everything out and do it. <br><br>  Well, as they say, she said and did.  Understand the ISO standards so that it could work as an auditor.  Arranged the work so that the whole company groaned. <br><br>  This was the second mistake.  Someone suggested that the processes should be developed by those who will use them later.  For example, I, then already - the head of the IT department, should develop a process for automation, infrastructure support, etc. <br><br>  The idea is not to say that it is completely flawed, there is a rational grain in it.  It seems that the person leading the process should better understand how to describe it.  But there is one caveat - the process must comply with the ISO standard.  It means that its developer should know this standard.  It is even better to understand.  To achieve this across the company, for several dozen processes, is almost unreal. <br><br>  Therefore, nothing at this stage did not work.  The girl handed out tasks to all, set a deadline, and the leaders together scored it.  The girl, of course, did not let up - she cursed, blasphemed with the last words at meetings, demanded the execution of a key project of the company.  As a result, she ponsed some kind of heresy, like students in essays, and the girl finally realized that she would have to write the papers herself. <br><br>  There already was found the optimal model, which was useful to her later.  Sent to the heads of the interviewers - his subordinates.  Managers told their processes as best they could, without understanding the ISO terminology (of the type instead of ‚Äúhere in the file we store‚Äù - ‚Äúthe records are stored in a file‚Äù).  And the process itself was done by those interviewers, the head of it was simply signed.  Most did it without looking.  There were those who read and were horrified - for example, me.  Rolled out a bunch of edits.  The girl came to me and said - either sign my version, or you will be left without an annual bonus.  Yes, it was she who persuaded the director to do this - she wanted to make a project.  Naturally, such a motivation worked for me - I signed it without looking. <br><br>  Well, that's it.  The processes were prepared quickly and beautifully.  Before certification, she naturally studied the practice of passing this event, knew all the pitfalls, and prepared all of us.  Each had a checklist, a memo, memorized the correct words and terms, and created shortcuts to documents and notes on the desktop.  The certification went brilliantly.  So it was rated by auditors.  They even said it was too brilliant - no one, they say, bothers so thoroughly. <br><br><h3>  Second project </h3><br>  The project promoted the girl up the career ladder - she became the director of quality.  In general, it is reasonable after all - she understood this better than anyone.  Naturally, she was subordinated to the Quality Control Department, one of the worst at that time departments. <br><br>  The trick was that the Quality Control Department worked not only at the exit of parts from production, but also at acceptance, and acceptance was the main responsibility.  The specifics of the industry required that the acceptance be complete, 100% control. <br><br>  Naturally, once the control is solid, it can create a lot of problems due to the timing of the test itself.  The details that are needed in the production came - if you please, wait until the Quality Control Department checks.  Items came for resale, deadlines are on, the car is worth loading - no, if you please, wait for the Quality Control Department to check.  OTC hated everything.  Not one boss could stay there for a long time ‚Äî they were driven out when they realized that they were not able to correct the situation. <br><br>  And the girl corrected.  It was such a project.  She performed brilliantly, Quality Control Department became the most disciplined, transparent and controlled department in the company. <br><br>  There has already been without me, more precisely - without automation.  Our relations at that moment were bad, and I worked, let's say, not very diligently.  Delayed terms, poorly tested, made mistakes.  But it did not work, because the girl personally controlled everything. <br><br>  She needs to make a document to reflect the results of the check - she completely organizes the whole process.  She writes TK herself (although I didn‚Äôt ask), she checks the interface herself, searches for errors herself, pokes everything up, comes up with checks herself so that people make fewer mistakes, she develops forms of analytical reports to fully control the activities of the unit.  Let me remind you that at that moment she was already the director of quality, and could easily delegate all this. <br><br>  Oddly enough, her energy was transferred to me.  I continued to hate the girl for her approaches to the matter and our shared past, but the automation that I did even started to like me.  Especially when they brought tangible results. <br><br>  Everything was simple there.  They organized a completely transparent accounting checks.  Any document entering the Quality Control Department automatically generated a certain Control card, which reflected the results of the check.  A suitable batch is automatically transferred to the receiving warehouse.  Marriage - automatically goes to the marriage warehouse.  The time parameters are fully recorded - input, output, date of verification.  Accordingly, each batch is under complete control. <br><br>  The standard inspection period established for the Quality Control Department is three days.  Since the girl finished this project, it has never been broken - although it used to happen that they checked it for two weeks.  In reality, of course, they tested faster, but this was already at the level of the organization, and not automation.  Just a girl made some ranks of the nomenclature, like ABC, and brought to all subordinates.  Class A is checked first, B is checked second, and so on.  With the use of common sense, of course - if the client needs to ship the details of group C in an hour, then they go to group A. <br><br>  Actually, this project is over.  OTC has become an exemplary department, on which everything was supposed to be equal.  And the girl is an exemplary leader who was able to quickly and efficiently restore order in such a mess. <br><br><h3>  Third project </h3><br>  The fame of the girl, as a great project manager, has already gone through the company.  Then the director changed, he was also told about this glory, and he decided to arrange a test.  The company was just about to expand, and rented an office - an entire floor in a class A building (well, yes, there are those in Chelyabinsk). <br><br>  The taste of the project was also in the fact that a little earlier, one move had already failed, due to poor organization.  The project manager (another person) made a fatal mistake - he attracted the entire company to the discussion of office design, and this process became endless.  Some want showers, others believe that this is nonsense - no one will ever take a shower at work.  Some want open space, others fiercely against.  Some want leather sofas, others believe that the sofas in the office - evil.  The unfortunate designer reworked the interior project several times, but the result did not come close.  As a result, they spat, abandoned, and for some time put off the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãrelocation as impracticable. <br><br>  And our girl, of course, immediately scored on the opinion of the plankton.  I collected demands and wishes only from top managers, carefully wrote everything down and went to work.  We, the leaders below, also once asked who wants what - just in case, all of a sudden the implementation of our requirements will be simple, then we can take them into account.  The IT department was luckier than others - firstly, we have a server, and secondly, our sysadmin naturally joined the office preparation team, and we influenced through it the choice of places, placement, etc. <br><br>  The main criteria for success were two - the budget and time.  The director wanted to move on December 1st.  In fact, he did not give a damn about the date of the move, but this was a test task for our girl.  Therefore, the term he insisted. <br><br>  Yes, I forgot to say - the office building was recently launched, and it was necessary not only to move, but also to make repairs, because  there was only a rough finish inside. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know the details of the office preparation process, alas.  was fascinated by his own affairs.  I know the result - we moved on December 2.  That is, missed our Akella for 1 day.  And the office turned out gorgeous.  The move was quick and comfortable. <br><br>  In the evening we were given boxes, told to load our own stuff into them, to sign and throw home.  Distributed passes for an office building - they were ready, with photos, etc.  Explained where to whom you can park - part of the car park the company rented. <br><br>  In the morning we arrived at the new office, our boxes were already standing near the tables.  I started working after a minute - I had a laptop, I just took it out and stuck it in the net.  The entire IT infrastructure was ready, no configuration required.  Not because the admin is well done, as you know.  Programmers with stationary computers earned in half an hour, of which about twenty minutes went and looked at the premises of the new office.  Admins ran for half a day, set up system blocks and monitors, connected printers, etc. <br><br>  As I recall, the director was not offended for the delay in 1 day. <br><br><h3>  Methods and practices </h3><br>  Examples of projects are, of course, good, but it is also necessary to make a squeeze of methods, techniques, chips and practices.  How, why did this girl get good projects?  I will try to talk about the methods that were repeated all the time, i.e.  They can be called tricks, and not random luck. <br><br><h4>  Waterfall </h4><br>  The girl in the management of projects has always used the good old model of the waterfall.  The project was divided into milestones, stages, tasks.  Each was a deadline and responsible. <br><br>  The girl is the only one who, in all seriousness, used the system I developed for project management.  Actually, she ordered it.  We had a well-functioning order management system covering the entire company.  Performance discipline was high, because  for overdue tasks depreciated.  She took advantage of this ready, working system. <br><br>  The only thing that had to be done was to organize atomic orders in cascades.  I added a couple of entities - projects, stages - she filled them in, wrote down the tasks, and they automatically turned into familiar tasks for everyone.  Many did not even realize that, when they were doing an assignment, they were doing some kind of project - the link to it was on one of the last bookmarks.  And the orders were executed on time. <br><br>  But the girl‚Äôs commitment to the waterfall was only official, in words.  In reality, she was incredibly flexible. <br><br><h4>  Flexibility </h4><br>  Actually, if you read carefully, then surely this flexibility was noticed.  If, for some reason, the project began to slip, went into the wrong steppe, there was a threat of failure, the girl did not continue to go the same way.  Many people continue, and then they say - and I, I did everything according to plan. <br><br>  Our heroine quickly reshaped the plan.  Itself canceled all previously issued tasks that are no longer relevant, and set new ones.  It did not work with one consultant - she took others.  It did not work with others - I did it myself.  The leaders let down - planted their subordinates. <br><br>  The main thing for her is the result, the completed project, subject to all limitations.  This is real flexibility, as it seems to me - to constantly raise your head, break away from the project‚Äôs routine, look for a goal and re-pave the way for it, like a navigator. <br><br><h4>  Dive into the subject area </h4><br>  In the essence of the project she always plunged completely.  If he implements the standard, he knows it far and wide, and at the same time - the practice of application, especially certification, of the most loyal auditors.  If the QCD ‚Äúraises from its knees‚Äù, it is as good as the engineers know how to measure Rockwell hardness, how the control and measuring machine works and why there are cracks in the metal. <br><br>  I think this approach was caused by a penchant for total control.  Well, so as not to cheat, do not hang noodles on the ears.  When a project manager poorly understands its essence, executors can delay deadlines, come up with unexpected difficulties, take time to study the issue.  It did not roll like that, incl.  I have. <br><br><h4>  Total control </h4><br>  Once a person knows the subject area, personally sets all the tasks and keeps all the documentation on the project, then he has the opportunity of total control.  Not everyone uses this opportunity, but our girl did it with joy. <br><br>  She knew the status of each task, with a very short lag ‚Äî a maximum of a day or two, usually less.  What, of course, zadalbyvala all project participants.  But she didn't care. <br><br><h4>  Pofigizm </h4><br>  It got along two completely different people.  While she is not in the project, then, as they say, on a light relaxation.  And you can talk - when our interests have ceased to intersect, relations have improved and we sometimes talked on a variety of topics, and help in a difficult situation, and support. <br><br>  But, as soon as she makes the project, it is better not to stand near and not to chew snot.  Rushing like a bulldozer in a good sense of the word.  It doesn‚Äôt matter to her whether you are busy or not, what your mood is, how many tasks in the work - she doesn‚Äôt get off until you do.  And, regardless of your position.  Even the director was forever owed her something. <br><br><h4>  Straws and PR </h4><br>  I saw such a reception only from her.  The bottom line is simple: periodically remind everyone that the project she is doing is incredibly complex and important.  Especially at meetings where all the management of the company meets. <br><br>  It is not very often that they do not have time to get used to it and do not stop perceiving this information.  Not very dramatic, so as not to think that he is complaining.  With a clear setting, "I'll do it anyway."  With understanding and pronouncing the details of the difficulties, no one will understand them anyway, but once again they will be amazed at the depth of immersion in the project. <br><br>  The meaning is simple.  Everyone knows that the project is incredibly complex.  Everyone knows what the hell you do.  And regardless of the result, the girl, as a project manager, will be well done. <br><br>  It didn‚Äôt work out - well, if it didn‚Äôt work out for Her, it means that it‚Äôs really difficult there. <br>  It turned out - the benefit is double, because everyone knows that it turned out not something there, but Something, or Wono It Che. <br><br><h3>  Summary </h3><br>  As you understood from the story, the girl did not find herself right away.  At first I just wanted to be a leader.  Even then, already being a quality director, she tried not to take on projects especially, concentrating on routine management. <br><br>  The understanding has come gradually, and in comparison with other colleagues.  Domestic projects in companies, as you know, are far from always successful, most of them were simply abandoned before they were completed.  And this girl did it all. <br><br>  So she understood her unique key advantage.  It began to be pumped in this area.  More precisely, in the combined - operational management plus project management.  How she managed to do everything is still a mystery, at least for me. <br><br>  Well, with all my heart I wish her success in the new place. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/452272/">https://habr.com/ru/post/452272/</a></p>
