    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  First, a little history </h4><br>  <s>Once upon a time in the cold winter time‚Ä¶</s> <br><br>  No, not at all.  Sometime recently, namely on September 11, 2008, someone named <a href="http://xaoccps.habrahabr.ru/">XaocCPS</a> announced the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/habradigest/39585/">Habradigest</a> project on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/habradigest/39585/">Habrahabr</a> . <br><br>  ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù - you say.  "We saw and read this." <br><br>  Wait.  The conversation is not about that.  And the conversation is that at this moment I was visited by a thought.  And why, why limit to one resource.  Of course, Habr is one of the leading projects in his focus and he has a <s>multi-million</s> fairly extensive readership.  But after all, there are quite a lot of other resources in the network, or rather in RuNet, that daily rest us with huge flows of information in all directions.  And since we are IT's, why not do good for our people and for ourselves? <br><br>  In the end, after some thought, appraisals and ratings, <a href="http://interitive.ru/">Interitive</a> appeared. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou have a mistake!‚Äù You say.  And you will be fundamentally wrong.  It is InterITive. <br><br><h4>  Now I will explain what it is. </h4><br>  Interitive stands for Internet-IT-Activity. <br><br>  The essence of this project is to provide IT with information for the end user.  But to provide this very information in the form in which we have recently got used to consuming it ‚Äî that would be a reinvention of the long-invented bicycle.  We decided to go the other way and put it all into a weekly magazine in PDF format (Thank you Adobe for our happy childhood). <br><br>  What we have at the moment and we want to present to you is a pilot release, created specifically for what is finally to understand: whether this is necessary for the end user and whether the game is worth the candle. <br><br>  The purpose of this initiative is to create the first in Runet, and most likely in the world of Web 2.0, namely, UGC, magazine.  In the near future, after the latest improvements, we will launch a site where we give you the right to announce the news in the next issue.  After all, the Runet is huge and immense, and there are only three of us.  Therefore, we are going to introduce a certain system of accounting, adding and discussing topics, and, of course, the results of our work. <br><br>  We reserve the copyright of the owners of any material that came to us in the magazine.  Although to simplify life, both myself and the authors, I would like to ask those who want his posts to be in numbers to place our logo somewhere in their profile or blog.  It is not even necessary to post a back link.  Just a logo.  Thus, you "kakbe" give us to understand that you are not opposed to your materials falling into the Interitive. <br><br>  By the way, yes.  I'm really not alone here.  There are three of us at the moment to create an objective assessment of the interestingness of the materials that will fall into the room. <br><br>  Three in the boat is actually <a href="http://unno.habrahabr.ru/">me</a> , <a href="http://shapelez.habrahabr.ru/">Shapelez</a> and <a href="http://va1en0k.net/">va1en0k</a> .  Why exactly?  Well, that's how it happened.  I know Shapelez for a long time from habrahabr and my IT resource, which many of you have probably heard about, and va1en0k appeared after Shapelez almost burned the entire office by conducting ‚Äúmarketing research‚Äù on Twitter. <br><br><h4>  Stop pulling tires </h4><br>  I will no longer delay and give you all the opportunity to <s>spit to</s> enjoy our creation. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://interitive.ru/media/2008-00.pdf">Download link</a></b> <br><br>  Most likely the issue turned out to be somewhat crumpled or too extensive, but it is precisely in order to understand all this and take into account all the shortcomings for the future, we release it.  Therefore, we urge you to leave your feedback here in the comments below.  The only thing we ask about is not to write about the look, layout, kerning and leading - this is all quite clear, because  None of us is a designer, coder or anyone similar to these professions. <br><br><h4>  Lyrics </h4><br>  Our ultimate goal is great and Google will obey us, or, in extreme cases, buy for DANAG.  But it is somewhere in the ‚Äúfar-distant future, in a distant-far galaxy‚Äù. <br><br>  If we miraculously begin to make money on our undertaking, then each author will receive a fee.  Wonderful, isn't it?  After all, every author who writes on Habrahabr or another resource does not even think about making money from his material.  The author, who writes in his journal, can earn money not only from advertising, but also from the texts themselves.  But it is in the future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41400/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41400/</a></p>
