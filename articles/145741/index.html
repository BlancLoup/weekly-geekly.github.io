  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sasha will help American users</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a31/2f4/ce1/a312f4ce16b538f418d832700c6c62fc.jpg" align="left" alt="image">  <i>A new employee has appeared in the technical support service of the US office of Kaspersky Lab - the virtual girl Sasha.</i>  <i>The job description instructs her to politely and competently help clients online: answer their questions or advise where and how to go through the site to get the necessary information.</i>  <i>From where the American agent has the Russian name, the project manager David Marchionek will tell.</i> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing a virtual agent in the American technical support service came after we learned that the virtual agent developed by the company VirtuOz also "works" in the customer service at the office in Germany.  Having learned about their successful experience, we decided that our technical support service would be nice to know more about this feature.  We made inquiries about similar offers from other companies-providers of virtual agents and also decided to stop the choice on VirtuOz, since their offer turned out to be the most profitable in terms of the combination of price and offered opportunities. <br><br>  Interestingly, the most difficult was ... choose a name for a virtual agent.  We knew that in Germany her name was Lena, but in America this name would not stick, therefore, initially, our project team wondered if we couldn‚Äôt call agent Cassie (as if linking her name with the company name).  But our marketing department, where we turned for a consultation, criticized the Cassi option for nothing.  This is how Sasha appeared - a girl with a Russian name, but understandable to any American.  It was like choosing a name for a firstborn: sometimes it‚Äôs so hard to decide.

          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      Considering the long-term experience of interaction with our technical support team with clients and our professional experience, Sasha was ‚Äútaught‚Äù how to communicate with the American client audience: how to respond to questions from American buyers and respond in accordance with the expectations and understanding of Americans.  She can give any answers to questions regarding the technical side of supporting our products: this can be a direct answer to a question, a link to the FAQ section or an article from the knowledge base, and even to another source, for example, the websites of our partners Best Buy or Digital River, if The question concerns the order. <br><br>  We expect that with a virtual agent we will have fewer calls to the Home Support Service and customers will have the opportunity to find a way to solve the problem they might have with some of our products.  A virtual agent is, in fact, an alternative to communicating with a technical support engineer.  The client can ask a question or explain the problem, and the virtual agent will direct him to solve the problem.  Plus, the company VirtuOz provides excellent tools that will help us monitor the behavior and work of Sasha. <br><br>  The project is moving fast enough - on March 23 we signed an agreement with VirtuOz, and on April 13, the project has already started.  Now, after a little more than a month, we are testing the initial content of the agent, and next month we plan that Sasha will work in full functionality mode in the pre-launch conditions.  In general, it is a good idea: to ‚Äúhire‚Äù other agents such as Sasha, for example, in the sales department or marketing department, because the German Lena successfully combines the work in technical support and sales. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36e/d65/0ed/36ed650edf539f753becfd7289fcfde1.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d5c/ec6/a7e/d5cec6a7eab07735bfb0a2c8e5d0e881.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145741/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145741/</a></p>
