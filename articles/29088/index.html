  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coworking: quarterly results</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Coworking, despite its appeal, is a rather vague idea.  On the one hand, the eternal dream to create one‚Äôs life without looking at other people's opinions and desires.  On the other - the reality in which everything costs money, and most of the things can not be done alone. <br>  But so far all opinions, both optimistic and critical, are based on solid theory and speculation.  It makes sense to add a little practice, right?  :) <br><br>  So, what works and what does not work in coworking: the result of the work of the club ‚ÄúTower‚Äù for 3 months.  I don‚Äôt know what is happening with coworking in other cities, so apply this information with an eye to it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Enthusiastic benefits</strong> <br><ol><li>  <strong>Free schedule and access:</strong> works.  Significantly simplifies life for everyone.  The disadvantage is that when working in a team it is difficult to combine graphics. </li><li>  <strong>Sharing technology:</strong> not working.  ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù equipment is not needed, each prefers to use his own and sharpened for themselves (except for the kitchen: kettle / fridge / microwave does not apply). </li><li>  <strong>Openness, information sharing:</strong> works at 200%.  Open in the discussion of their affairs and the desire to collect opinions often leads to the union. </li><li>  <strong>More work than home:</strong> work fine.  The level of comfort is close to home, but at the same time everyone understands that this is a place to work. </li><li>  <strong>Pleasant creative atmosphere:</strong> confirmed.  The atmosphere really exists, somehow it is created by itself, and it is this that distinguishes coworking from work in an office, cafe, home or somewhere else. </li><li>  <strong>Shared kitchen, recreation room, conference, library:</strong> working.  The functional separation of the premises and the ‚Äúcommon ownership‚Äù of them is pleasant to all. </li><li>  <strong>General lawyer, accounting, managers, advertising and other related services:</strong> works.  So far we have only a general sales manager, analytics and advertising, but there is no doubt that this is relevant and convenient. </li></ol><br><br>  <strong>Critical critics minuses</strong> <br><ol><li>  <strong>Conflict of relations:</strong> confirmed.  There are problems, and there are serious.  Constant monitoring of contacts and timely resolution of conflicts is required. </li><li>  <strong>Dirt, disgusting and all that:</strong> not confirmed.  To maintain order, we only need a garbage bag at each table and vacuum it once a week.  The guys take off their shoes at the entrance (we have a soft carpet). </li><li>  <strong>Theft and ‚Äúratry activity‚Äù:</strong> not confirmed.  Perhaps this is facilitated by the general atmosphere of ‚Äúwe do not offend ourselves‚Äù and unpredictable attendance.  Additionally, you can use incoming filtering, because the atmosphere is important, and even one conflicted or unpleasant person can spoil it. </li><li>  <strong>Reluctance to spend money on travel, food, equipment, etc .:</strong> not seen.  Perhaps those who are uncomfortable, just do not come to us. </li><li>  <strong>Talking on the phone will interfere:</strong> not confirmed.  Perhaps the case in the high-rise structure of the room. </li><li>  <strong>Problems of privacy (discussion of cases, contracts, etc.):</strong> not seen.  Most likely, this is the influence of the atmosphere: the desire to close and ‚Äúnot disclose‚Äù raises a logical question, ‚Äúwhat do you do in co-working then, the main advantage of which is the free exchange of information?‚Äù </li><li>  <strong>Do not bring customers:</strong> partially confirmed.  Coworkers are not against, but customers are against.  Most likely, the case in the "club" format of the room. </li><li>  <strong>Problems with the payment for the room, the situation, etc .:</strong> not confirmed.  Perhaps the point is in the transparency of our business processes (I don‚Äôt hide what money is spent on and how much money we need for development) </li><li>  <strong>Problems with the legal registration of all this:</strong> not confirmed.  For the incredulous one more time: NO any problems.  Lease and sublease agreements resolve all issues. </li><li>  <strong>Problems with the legal registration of orders:</strong> not confirmed.  In the Tower there are a couple of entrepreneurs, several founders of LLC and relations with the JSC.  If you need to ‚Äúget guarantees‚Äù, you can place an order using any convenient scheme. </li></ol>

      <strong>findings</strong> <br>  My opinion: enthusiastic theorists turned out to be more insightful than critics theorists.  Coworking live and grow. <br><br><br>  If you forgot something, ask, I will answer. <br>  Sincerely, Alexey Glazkov. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29088/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29088/</a></p>
