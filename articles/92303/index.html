  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Standard Programmer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About a week ago I took part in the competition for an open vacancy of Microsoft.  And failed.  A week passed, the thoughts in my head (how could it be? It can not be!) Settled down a bit and I made some conclusions from this experience, with which I want to share with the masters. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  4 years ago, when I graduated from university, I didn‚Äôt know who I wanted to be.  Since when I was a student, I worked as a system administrator, I took part mainly in competitions for a similar position.  Quite by chance, on the advice of a friend, I got into a rather large Novosibirsk company for an interview for a C ++ developer position.  At the interview I was asked very different questions (why do I need inheritance? Did you know stl?), 90% of which I did not answer, but I only remembered well one: ‚Äúhow to turn the string?‚Äù.  I thought and wrote pseudocode on a nuclear mixture of C ++, Pascal and PHP.  They said to me: ‚Äúwell, normally ... and now without a buffer storing the position of the middle of the line ...‚Äù  I was told: ‚ÄúWe take you.  Get off at work on Monday. ‚Äù <br><br>  How my future team leader was able to discern in me an intelligent (not modest, yes?) Developer, it's still a mystery to me.  I asked him later, and he said that the others were just worse, and I was not so bad.  Now, if I were in his place, I probably wouldn't have taken anyone. <br><br>  The company in which I worked, I liked.  We were given time to raise our own professional level, reading books.  We (greens, yesterday's students) attended seminars where we were told about design patterns, object-oriented design, and much more.  After half a year, I have already operated badly with the C ++ language.  In addition, I mastered debugging, memory leak detection, profiling, unit testing.

      Then I had a lot of places to work ... My current place of work is the 5th in a row, including the freelance period. <br><br>  And the more I understood various software systems (from a banal web site to a CDN, from a VoIP gateway to a CRM system), the more I hated the people who wrote this.  Especially fiercely, I hated graduates of mekhmat and former Olympiad students.  I did not understand why I needed to implement the binary sorting myself, did not understand why to implement a coherent list, why write a handwriting messaging service using the same protocol.  And then I had to deal with these self-made solutions and support them. <br><br>  In order not to spoil my karma and not to hate my colleagues, I tried to solve any <i>standard</i> problem in a <i>standard</i> way.  To implement data storage in a DBMS, I used a <i>standard</i> ORM (Hibernate, Doctrine) and never even tried to write mine.  If it was necessary to design a new part of the system, I used <i>standard</i> and simple design patterns from the classics.  If it was necessary to implement sending mail, I used <i>standard</i> libraries for this (Java Mail API, Zend Framework).  I know quite a lot of such <i>standard</i> solutions (and I continue to look for them every day) in order to solve almost any problem.  I, as a good cook, who can cook a large number of various dishes, knowing a large number of various recipes. <br><br>  And I got the impression that a good programmer should be just that.  Use <i>standard</i> solutions for <i>standard</i> tasks.  And the more such solutions he knows, the better the programmer is. <br><br>  ... and all this led to the fact that I have forgotten how to think.  For any technical question, I look for the answer in Google.  When at the Microsoft interview I was asked how to select from the int ar [n] = {...} n-1 elements so that the product of the selected was the maximum, for a while I fell into a stupor.  The first question that arose in my head: " <s>On * ya?</s> Why?"  Then I tried to recall a similar algorithm from some <i>standard</i> library, which I know more than one ... and could not.  In the end, I solved the task, but apparently not as easily as the interviewer had expected. <br><br>  I'm not a bad <i>standard</i> programmer who can quickly solve <i>standard</i> problems.  I never apply a non-standard solution, until I study the entire issue of Google to the last page.  I don‚Äôt like to write executable code at all, because I constantly make mistakes in it that need to be searched and corrected.  I like to add xml-configs that come in a package from the developer. <br><br>  I am a <i>standard</i> programmer.  And this is perhaps not even bad.  But I cannot solve non-standard engineering tasks as easily as 4 years ago with a completely empty head, not loaded with tens of thousands of pages of various books and manuals. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92303/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92303/</a></p>
