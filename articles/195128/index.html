We wrote several Hypercard stacks together, and finally, on my 12th or 13th birthday, I received a copy of Discover Programming (a compressed version of Metrowerks‚Äôs now-missing Codewarrior IDE) and a book on C. Now the idea is to pay for development tools It seems absurd, but at that time there were not so many free tools for Mac. <br><br>  <i>I‚Äôm showing you what I‚Äôve been listening to.</i>  <i>It was a copy of the Programming Programming (it was a copydown version of the Metrowerks ‚Äônow defunct Codewarrior IDE). at the time there weren't many free tools for the Mac.</i> <br><br>  <b>What are you working on right now?</b> <br><br>  Most of the time it takes work at Dressipi.  Together with my team, I develop an online virtual services stylist services, which is partly based on expert advice, partly - on the engine with recommendations.  I recently spent my free time with several RubyMotion projects. <br><br>  <i>Work at Dressipi has been taken up most of my time.</i>  <i>I‚Äôm a team of experts who are on the Internet.</i>  <i>Recently I've been a few projects in my spare time.</i> <br><br>  <b>What is the best and worst part of your job?</b> <br><br>  I have to solve a wide range of problems, and I am absolutely free to choose a solution.  I love working in small companies where I can feel how my work can actually change the direction of development and the future of the company.  It is difficult to give someone the right to solve a really interesting task!  It is still not easy to balance work and life outside it, but the worst is the road to work, which takes 2 hours each way.  In addition, I don‚Äôt have as much time as I would like to keep up with technological innovations. <br><br>  <i>I get to tackle a lot of freedom.</i>  <i>I love you.</i>  <i>To solve!</i>  <i>It is nearly 2 hours each way.</i>  <i>I also like it.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <b>What do you consider your main achievement in life / career at the moment?</b> <br><br>  I had a great time in previous work at Texperts.  We started as a small British company, and then we were acquired by an American company, and our advertising was played during the Super Bowl.  Receiving the Ruby Hero award in 2012 was an unexpected but pleasant surprise.  Up to 20 years, I spent a lot of time writing Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãDownload - shareware tool for Mac.  In general, this is not so much, but I think we managed to sell somewhere around 100 thousand, and this is without external financing.  Although it distorts me when I review part of the code!  The first 4 years I did not even use a controller version. <br><br>  <i>We had an amazing time at Texperts (my previous job).</i>  <i>It was during the Superbowl.</i>  <i>Winning a Ruby Hero award in 2012 was an unexpected but welcome surprise.</i>  <i>In my late teens I spent a lot of time, I wrote a shareware tool for the Mac.</i>  <i>Although it is small overall, copies with no outside funding.</i>  <i>I cringe when i look back at some of the code though!</i>  <i>For the first 4 years I didn‚Äôt even use version control.</i> <br><br>  <b>What is the purpose of your career and professional development?</b> <br><br>  Early retirement and go to a tropical paradise with high-speed Internet. <br><br>  <i>Paradise with hi-speed internet.</i> <br><br>  <b>What helps a programmer to grow professionally?</b> <br><br>  Never allow the coding process to become a routine work.  You need to continue to write code for fun, whether it is an open-source project or you are just busy at home with some kind of fixed idea. <br><br>  <i>Never let it only become a day job.</i>  <i>If you have been a contributor to it.</i> <br><br>  <b>What book would you recommend to read to any programmer?</b> <br><br>  I have never really developed a relationship with books on programming, I bought them in such a quantity that many simply did not finish reading.  Although I liked the book ‚ÄúUnderstanding Computation‚Äù by Tom Stewart: it is always great to return to the postulates that we take for granted and consider the underlying concepts. <br><br>  <i>I bought it.</i>  <i>It was still a matter of understanding.</i> <br><br>  <b>What do you like to do when you don't write code?</b> <br><br>  Programming does not leave me a lot of free time, but I love to read, play video games and table tennis. <br><br>  <i>But I‚Äôm not reading much.</i> <br><br>  <b>Thanks for the interview and see you in Moscow!</b> <br><br><h5>  The conference </h5><br>  We invite everyone to the RailsClub'Moscow 2013 conference. Traditionally, we will feed, give presents, hold contests and lotteries, play good music :) There will be a lot of interesting and informative. <br><br>  <a href="http://railsclub.timepad.ru/event/76008/%3Futm_refcode%3D95c73ccecc305e313977a72d1c6f02260353ae99">Registration and payment of participation in the conference</a> .
