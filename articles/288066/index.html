      Goblin Gaga <a href="http://www.goblin-gaga.livejournal.com/1037922.html">talks</a> about commerce in a live magazine: ‚Äú <em>Working for a blog is not easy. You really have to work for it. Being up to date, tracking trends, maintaining and increasing your audience, choosing (choosing) advertisers. And making it so that advertising on a blog it was not an advertisement, but an interesting event. It is difficult. I constantly have to think, win in something, tack. Between the audience and the advertiser</em> . <br><br>  He is <a href="http://www.scandal-max.livejournal.com/488025.html">echoed by</a> another thousandth person - the Scandal Max: ‚ÄúThe <em>commercialization of LJ, which so frightened some, happened long ago. Or, if you like, it will never happen. First, it‚Äôs pretty stupid to assume that if someone really decided to earn money for LJ, he would have done it that way. Nobody, as it had happened before, would understand that some people receive a coin if this someone seriously wanted it. Generally, it should be noted that Zhzhyuzry internally accepted the idea of that blogs are money (albeit small). Indignation at the ‚Äúcommercialization‚Äù can be expressed</em>  <em>only if you believe in its possibility. And everything possible, as is known, is inevitable. So, comrades, the SUP was right. The commercial potential is high</em> . " <br><br>  Well, in this same block, I decided to add a <a href="http://popunder.livejournal.com/11017.html">user distribution map</a> depending on their ‚Äúthermodynamic‚Äù remoteness.  It‚Äôs rather long and difficult to explain what it is, you'd better come by yourself and lose.  I will only quote here one of the conclusions of the script's author: ‚ÄúThe <em>Russian-speaking community (not Russian, that is speaking) in LiveJournal is phenomenally closed like no other, if you click on random friends in this cluster, then, on average, 66 clicks will be required , to get on not our user</em> ". <br><br>  <strong>Week of Belarus</strong> <br><br>  And at this time, bloggers did not think about enslaving the world by financial flows, but tore off to the fullest.  That is, we went to clubs and stared at our loved ones.  Already, as many as two parties, directly or indirectly devoted to LJ, took place in Minsk.  First, on November 14, a universal reel of Belarusian LJ-users passed in the buffet ‚ÄúEYO‚Äù.  Everyone went joyful and with badzhikami chest.  True, I did not see it, because I did not go to the party and did other things.  However, for some reason, it was fun without me.  What <a href="http://b-twisted.livejournal.com/70647.html">are the</a> numerous <a href="http://fevra.livejournal.com/233702.html">reports of</a> people who visited this event. <br><br>  And on November 18, a party of community members <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/minsk_by">minsk_by</a> took place in the club "Grafitti".  ZhZhistov meeting was held in a relaxed atmosphere, as evidenced by the <a href="http://www.studenty.by/doc14-52.html">photos</a> from the scene.  Apparently, the organization and holding of such parties will soon become fashionable, and every week bloggers will be able not only to bite each other in virtual reality, but also to clean up their face during a real meeting in a club. <br><br>  In parallel, Kolya Motorin began to compile a <a href="http://motorin.diskoteq.com/metro-lj">map of the Minsk LJ Metro</a> .  More precisely, the map of geographical distribution of LiveJournal service users by stations of the Minsk metro.  And it takes into account both the place of residence and the place of work.  As you understand, the map will be updated live, perhaps, in the near future, someone will make a layer for CityInfo.  So do not forget to leave your mark on the map! <br><br>  The personal opening of the week for me was the site <a href="http://dnevnik.by/">dnevnik.by</a> .  According to official data, the service began to work as early as January 1 of this year.  As I did not notice him for almost eleven months, I won‚Äôt attach my mind!  In order to somewhat justify my blindness, I note that a search on the Internet gave only one news about the start of this service.  It is strange that dnevnik.by is so poorly advertised.  For all the time a little less than 450 diaries have been registered on the service - a figure, frankly, a modest one.  And this is despite the large number of features and conveniences that dnevnik.by offers to every registered person.  It seems to me that the main problem here is in the positioning of the service - the creators are promoting it as a blog for Belarusian youth.  For me personally, this is one of the main reasons for not using dnevnik.by, although I am very young.  After all, a blog is, first of all, an interesting original text, and the word ‚Äúyouth‚Äù is associated with inexperience, spelling mistakes and ‚Äúscum‚Äù slang.  Who would want every day instead of, for example, Lukyanenko and goblin_gaga, to read the pink snot of an eleventh-grader who was disappointed in his life and guys?  Nevertheless, I will try to get comments from the creators of dnevnik.by by the next edition of the newspaper. <br><br>  <strong>And at this time ...</strong> <br><br>  ... a wonderful article ‚Äú <a href="http://log-it.ru/2006/11/14/13">First Steps in WordPress</a> ‚Äù appears on the Log It blog.  If you are going to start a stand-alone blog, this article is strictly required to read.  Of course, fans of other engines might argue that this is a direct WordPress ad.  Well, I advertise something to which the heart is more. <br><br>  ... an altruistic project created on the basis of Wordpress, a certain amount of free time of several enthusiasts and their desire to promote Wordpress in Russia began its work at <a href="http://bloground.ru/">bloground.ru</a> .  Yes, he is again!  Another service for maintaining your own blog.  If you remember the news that blogs will soon appear on tut.by too, then consider bloground.ru as an echo.  Or vice versa.  That's what the creators of this service promise us: " <em>You will get a Wordpress-based blog + the opportunity to properly understand its settings, several useful plug-ins to it, a whole bunch of great custom themes, a link of the form name.bloground.ru, 50 megabytes for uploading photos, pictures and podcasts, the ability to automatically copy everything that you write here, to any blog on the Livejournal engine, and if you behave yourself - also a sword, a gun and a bulldog puppy</em> . " <br><br>  ... we are taught <a href="http://kontei.livejournal.com/102849.html">how to write a bestseller</a> .  In the first part, kontei tells how to turn notes on a napkin into a thick book.  Simply put, increase the amount of text.  I think many authors of the beloved all-galactic newspaper sin with the presence of water in the texts, and I am not an exception.  To the reader was aware, he is obliged to click on the link and read the text.  Naturally, the quote: " <em>Do not listen to losers who will shame you for the fact that there is a lot of water in your creation, and argue that the book should be sensible and efficient, citing your own publications as an example. Believe me - these are just fuckers who do not know how really manage their own time. They spend too much energy on each of their books, and their hourly wages go out too low. So they never make a lot of money on their books</em> . " <br><br>  ... I get an eye on a blog entry a year and a half ago.  Better, the author will say everything to me: ‚Äú <em>Guys, do not give up, fight for life. Neither glass, nor needle, nor a shoal will save you from your thoughts. You cannot walk the heartbreak and be the most miserable in the world. Take me an example. I work, I do what I want, I live and I am glad. You can never give up!</em> ".  And indeed, after reading the <a href="http://avvadonn.livejournal.com/1504.html">entire post</a> from beginning to end, I want to start conquering the world right now! <br><br>  <strong>The last word</strong> <br><br>  I want to finish with two links and again about the money.  First, the <a href="http://karina-barbie.livejournal.com/2267.html">message of a virgin</a> who is looking for a man who is ready to pay a million dollars (or ten times less) for the night with her.  Secondly, the <a href="http://bjashka-06.livejournal.com/44019.html">letter of the boy</a> in one provincial Russian newspaper.  As they say, no comment.  How nice that I am a hamster ... <br><br>  <strong>Alexey Kaletsky</strong> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006470601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 47, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288066/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288066/</a></p>
