      On the landing page, you describe your company - the client does not care about that.  He wants to know what benefits he will get. <br><br>  You tell him about the ‚Äúunique‚Äù technologies - the client does not care about that.  He wants to know how this will improve his life. <br><br>  You describe the product with abstruse words - the client does not understand you and goes to a competitor.  The competitor "speaks" in his language. <br><br>  You create a business, build a strategy, create a website in accordance with your assumptions, views and understand the needs - you make a mistake. <br><br>  It should be the other way around.  You ask the right questions of the target audience.  Get the answer.  From the answers to the right questions, you build a strategy for working with clients, create the structure of the site, describe your product / service.  So you are customer oriented.  And this is the right approach that allows you to create a successful business. <br><br>  Check out how well you know your target audience.  Ask her these 34 questions. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Questions about the site </h4><br><br>  When asking questions about the site, it is better to avoid common wording.  Only specific questions, friends. <br><br>  <b>1. What do you want to do / look for on our website?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  You will find out what potential customers want to do on the site.  Moreover, you will be surprised if they will look for those things that you do not even suspect.  And in no other way you could not know about it.  This is the difference between qualitative data (answers to questions) and quantitative data (web analytics data). <br><br>  It is possible that the answers to this question will be good ideas for changing the structure of the site, adding new services / features to your product. <br><br>  <b>2. Did you find the information you were looking for?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  You will understand if visitors find what they are looking for.  If not, then there may be two reasons. <br><br>  The first is that the site is made so inconvenient that a potential client cannot satisfy his need.  He wants to give his money, but can not.  The solution to the problem is to change the structure of the site, improve usability, conduct user cases and make the process of performing the target action as simple as possible. <br><br>  The second is your offer does not meet the needs of the client.  You may be attracting ‚Äúwrong‚Äù traffic. <br><br>  In this situation, the solution is to change channels and ways to attract visitors.  If the traffic is ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù, then the problem with the proposal and it needs to be changed is to adjust to the needs of the target audience. <br><br>  <b>3. Was this information helpful?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  You will understand how much correct and useful information you provide to potential customers.  If they find it useful, then everything is OK - they find what they are looking for.  If not, then you should reconsider your approach to creating content.  After all, if the client does not receive the necessary information, then he is unlikely to perform the target action. <br>  For example, on each page of Google Support is placed this question <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/168/efc/ad0/168efcad0d744e30b8001bd88cf228bf.png"><br><br>  And, based on the answer to this question, they can evaluate the effectiveness of the content.  If the share of answers ‚ÄúNot very useful‚Äù will be high - this is an occasion to think about how best to present the information. <br><br>  <b>4. How much effort did you take to accomplish the desired action?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  You will learn how difficult it is for a potential client to solve their problem.  The problem in each case may be different.  In the online store is the purchase of goods.  On the information site - search for the necessary information.  Depending on this, the text of the question changes. <br><br>  <b>5. Did you like our site?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  You will learn directly from a potential client how he visually perceives the site.  In this case, you can use the scale with points, which will simplify both the answer to the question for the visitor and the processing of answers.  If the ratings are low, then the site is poorly made and does not meet the expectations of the target audience.  It is logical that the improvement of the site in accordance with the needs of visitors, will increase the conversion and sales. <br><br>  <b>6. Is it easy to navigate our site?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  Another way to understand how easy it is for a potential client to use the site, navigate through it and search for the necessary information.  This question is best placed on pages where bounce and exit rates are highest <br><br>  <b>7. Do you understand our pricing policy?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  You will find out if a potential customer understands how the price of a product / service is formed.  This question is most suitable for SaaS services, where pricing is very incomprehensible: confusion with the monthly and annual payment, payment for additional features, etc.  So this question is great for the pricing page on the SaaS service website. <br><br>  <b>8. How can we improve our pricing page?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  You will learn what to add / change / explain in more detail on the pricing page.  This question is preferably used in tandem with the previous one.  In the first case, you determine whether the page is understandable to potential customers, and in the second, you get tips on how to improve it. <br><br>  Of course, some will offer a lower price.  Do not give in to provocations, if pricing is justified.  If not, then you need to think carefully about whether the correct pricing policy was chosen initially. <br><br>  <b>9. What initially attracted you to our site?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  You will find out what elements of the site made the user stay on it.  And based on this information, you can make further changes on the site to create an ideal ‚Äúfirst contact‚Äù with a potential client. <br><br>  <b>10. If you were asked to rate our site on a 5-point scale, what grade would you give?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  As well as questions about visual appeal and navigation, this allows you to understand how convenient it is for a visitor to use the site and achieve its goals.  If along with this question you are asked to explain why a particular score was chosen, then you will find out what the target audience likes / dislikes. <br><br>  Why precisely five-point scale?  It is simpler: there are 5 options to choose from, not 10. The fact is that too much choice creates friction with the user.  As a result, he may refuse to answer the question at all. <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/advice/otvety-na-20-samyx-rasprostranennyx-voprosov-po-ab-testirovaniyu/">Answers to the 20 most common questions on A / B testing</a></i> <br><br>  <b>11. What do you like most about the site?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  Lets understand what most attracts potential customers on the site.  Through this, you can learn what to focus on. <br><br>  Consider the example of an online store where free shipping is available for all products.  But the information about this is written in a small-small font in the upper right corner.  With this question you will learn that free delivery is one of the main reasons why customers like the site and they place orders from you. <br><br>  Which of these can be concluded? <br><br>  Right.  If you actually provide free shipping for all products, then this is a competitive advantage.  This information should be highlighted and highlighted absolutely on every page.  After such a small change, most likely, the conversion of visitors into buyers will greatly increase. <br><br>  <b>12. Do you have any problems, questions, suggestions?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  This open question allows visitors to share any other information.  For example, about the bugs on the site or other problems that you were not interested in other issues, if you asked them at all. <br><br>  The sooner you learn about the problem, the sooner you can fix it.  This is important because  for large companies, even one small bug in the payment process can cost a lot of money. <br><br>  <b>13. Are you satisfied with your purchase?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  Thanks to the answer, you will understand whether the product meets the client's expectations and is satisfied with the purchase.  This question should be asked after the purchase. <br><br>  <b>14. Was it easy to make a purchase?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  You will learn how difficult it is for the customer to arrange the payment process on the site. <br><br>  Just think: a potential client already wants to give his money, but because of the complicated process of ordering, paying, confirming, you "stick the wheel in the wheel". <br><br>  Thus, if making a purchase is difficult, it means you need to simplify this stage.  For example, remove not the most important fields and requirements, run an <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie-what-is-it/">A / B experiment</a> and see how this change affects the conversion rate. <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/services/user-surveys/">Review of the best services for user surveys</a></i> <br><br>  <b>15. What can we do to improve the purchase process / payment process?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  The answer to this question will help to understand what information is missing from potential customers in the process of placing an order. <br><br>  This question is a supplement to the previous one.  There we will learn in general the impressions of the purchase process, and here we ask you to share your wishes on how this process can be improved. <br><br>  For example, you have an online store.  You specify the shipping cost right in front of the page where you need to enter the payment card details.  A visitor enters the site, adds the product to the cart.  It goes into it, but does not see the cost of delivery anywhere.  This is the first point of "friction".  He immediately has a question: ‚ÄúHow much will I have to pay for the delivery, will my money be enough on the card or will they send me the goods for free?‚Äù. <br><br>  If in the answer to this question, visitors indicate that it is necessary to add information about the delivery directly to the basket, to the price of the goods, then this is what needs to be done. <br><br>  Or another example.  The online store never states which payment means are accepted for payment.  The visitor adds the product to the cart, wants to pay for it, reaches the last stage and sees that you can only pay with a Visa card, MasterCard or using Paypal, and he has only Webmoney.  The customer spent his time.  Customer upset.  This is a bad user case.  There would be information about the means of payment in the basket - such a problem would not have arisen. <br><br>  <b>16. What do you value most in our website / in our company?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  Answers to this question will tell you on what principles, functions, characteristics of the product should be emphasized. <br>  For example, you sell eco-products, but do not focus on the theme of "environmental friendliness".  Asking such a question to customers, you understand that it is the ‚Äúenvironmental friendliness‚Äù factor that is the main reason for choosing your products.  What conclusion can be drawn from this? <br><br>  This characteristic should be the basis for product positioning.  It is this information that the visitor should find out at the first contact with the product. <br><br>  <b>17. If you could change one thing on the site, what would it be?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  This question is relevant if you want to improve the appearance of the site.  Since users of t can notice even the smallest problems on the site and offer good alternative ideas.  Collecting such feedback you can make a whole list of "site improvements".  But do not blindly follow them.  Each idea must be approached objectively and evaluated in terms of advantages and disadvantages.  Since there can be a lot of ideas and you need to choose those that can most of all affect the effectiveness of the site. <br><br>  <b>18. Would you recommend our site to your friends or colleagues?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  It allows you to understand what impression your site has about the site.  As Word of Mouth Marketing (Word of mouth) is one of the best ways to advertise for free, it‚Äôs very important to create a good impression of yourself. <br><br>  This is especially true now, when one of the factors for making a purchase is the advice of a friend / acquaintance / colleague.  After all, before you buy something, we consult with friends who have already made such a purchase, or understand this product / service.  Is not it so? <br><br>  In such conditions, it is extremely important to take care of the impression left.  Even if it is bad, then you will always have the opportunity to contact this client, find out the reasons for this relationship and try to fix it.  A cool, polite and attentive support service can change this impression.  The main thing is to be flexible. <br><br><h4>  Product Questions </h4><br><br>  Your product is your business.  A bad product is a bad business.  Therefore, you should know what customers think about your product. <br><br>  <b>19. What basic value do you get from our product?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  You will understand the main value of the product for the client.  And it is on this and you will need to focus on all marketing materials. <br><br>  It often happens that business owners pay full attention to one benefit, although for the client, in fact, all value lies in the other.  If you do not ask such a question, then you can never know what your product gives the client and what you should focus on in positioning. <br><br>  <b>20. What problem do you want to solve with our product?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  The answer to this question also allows you to understand what problem the potential client you solve.  In an amicable way, you should know about this even before starting a business.  But if this question was not worked out initially, then it's time to do it now. <br><br>  Having learned the main problem that potential customers are trying to solve, you can focus on this when promoting, when writing promotional materials and when finalizing the product itself. <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/various/kak-uvelichit-kolichestvo-repostov-kontenta/">How to increase the number of content reposts</a></i> <br><br>  <b>21. What are the most important functions for you in our product?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  He gives an understanding of the most important features of the product.  You can have one idea, and your customers have a completely different one.  Accordingly, you should concentrate on those things that are important to customers, not to you personally. <br><br>  Especially this issue is relevant with the constant refinement of additional functionality.  When there is a large check-list of ideas and it is difficult to understand what needs to be developed / refined in the first place.  The answer to this question will help to prioritize and focus on meeting the needs of the client, and not on their own assumptions. <br><br>  <b>22. What features are redundant?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  You will learn on the development, what functions have spent their time in vain.  And, most likely, this could have been avoided if you were interested in what is important for a potential client and what is not. <br><br>  However, having learned about what is needed and what is not, you will be able to build the right development strategy in the future. <br><br>  <b>23. Why did you make a purchase from us?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  You will understand the motivation of customers: why they decided to buy from you, which influenced their decision.  Knowing this information, you can concentrate on these factors.  As a result - an even greater increase in the motivation to make an order from you. <br><br>  <b>24. What products or services would you like to see on our site?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  If you plan to expand your business, but do not know what to choose, the answer to this question will help you.

What prevented you from making a purchase with us?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  You will understand what information is missing a potential client who is already ready to give their money.  Or find out what elements confuse him and prevent you from making a purchase. <br><br>  Knowing the answer to this question, you can quickly add the necessary information or change a specific element on the site. <br><br>  <b>26. What was your biggest problem when searching for the necessary product on the site?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  It gives an understanding of how conveniently the search for products on the site is configured.  Based on the answers, you can understand that the site does not have enough categories and filters to search for the product, or you need to add the ‚ÄúProduct search‚Äù field to the page.  This is especially true of large online stores, where the availability of a convenient search is one of the most important elements of the site. <br><br>  <b>27. What could convince you to use our product more often?</b> <br><br>  What gives the answer to this question: <br><br>  You will learn how to increase the number of repeat purchases.  Everyone knows that the new client is much more expensive than the current one.  If a loyalty program is important for users with a small discount, then give it to them.  The main thing to keep.
