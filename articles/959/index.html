About a year ago I wrote and published on <a href="http://www.creatiff.ru/">Creatiff.ru a</a> typology of clients and performers.  I do not think that any of you managed to get acquainted with this material - the project is neither alive nor dead.  And, meanwhile, the topic itself does not lose relevance, so I will take the liberty to publish another release with minor corrections and additions. <br><br>  As already mentioned in previous posts, I am an industry <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/iproducer/2162.html">web producer</a> .  On the one hand, my responsibilities include requirements management: I communicate with clients and bring them to a specific construct, with which you can already work.  On the other hand, my responsibilities include the management of the creative team: the one that implements the received requirements.  You can say that I'm between two fires.  On the one hand, customers are under pressure, on the other, designers are pushing, on the third, managers are fussing (this is a separate topic altogether).  Everyone has their own truth, everyone ‚Äúneeds‚Äù, and I also ‚Äúneed‚Äù ... It never gets boring.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  I spend a lot of meetings with clients.  And at some point all this disgrace made me write a classifier of what is most common.  Yes, I will immediately draw your attention to the fact that the material as a whole is devoted to negative experience.  It is somehow better remembered and stored.  A positive - why keep it, everything is fine with him. <br><br>  If you take in a situation as a whole, then there are only two problems, and they do not change (at least that time that I have been observing since 2000): this is the lack of goals / objectives and the lack of authority. <br><br>  The absence of goals / objectives is the subject of a separate study, we will certainly touch on this.  In short, I will say that by and large nobody needs anything.  The vast majority of customers can not clearly articulate why they need a website.  But they can clearly say who they instructed him to do.  And this is the second problem: the lack of authority.  Because they instructed to instruct, but they did not give any opportunity to make decisions. <br><br>  In our working slang, the one who commissioned is the ‚Äúbody‚Äù, and the one who conveyed is the ‚Äúgasket‚Äù. <br><br>  If you communicate directly with the body - in any case, this is luck.  Your path to project delivery should be shorter and easier.  But.  There are nuances because there are such bodies as: <br><br>  1. <b>Cretin</b> - a person with unpredictable reactions.  He will constantly change his opinion, priorities, juggle goals and objectives.  A good example is the situation ‚Äúthe client did not dance‚Äù - that is, he did not receive satisfaction in the amount in which he transferred funds to you (he estimates the volume on his own internal scale).  And here ‚Äúcretin‚Äù will continue the process even if the result has already been achieved and any continuation leads only to its deterioration. <br>  2. The <b>king</b> is a person who has condescended to cooperate (communicate) with you.  At every moment in time, he will reinforce the feeling in you that you are wasting his precious time.  Any of his words must be caught, his every glance kept in his heart.  King single channel.  It works only on broadcasting.  Most often, all that he broadcasts - bullshit.  But learn to take it seriously. <br>  3. <b>Karabas-barabas</b> - a character who wants in your face obedient dolls.  He will manipulate the process, impose his decisions on you and demand their strict execution.  All your arguments about the inexpediency of these decisions will be indignantly swept aside (the more proposals, the more indignation). <br>  4. <b>Dunno</b> - a person who inserts ‚ÄúI don't know‚Äù through the word.  You get the impression that he knows nothing at all.  In fact, he simply does not want to take responsibility.  "Think for yourself, decide for yourself."  And be ready, as soon as you bring your work to him, he will immediately turn into a knowledge - and will drown you with his criticism in the format of ‚Äúthis is not so‚Äù, ‚Äúand I thought that‚Äù and ‚Äúwell, what are you, Iglesias.‚Äù <br>  5. The <b>House Council</b> is a collegial decision-making body.  You come, and everyone gathers for you: the main one, marketing, the ‚Äúhead of the transport department‚Äù, ‚Äúthe academician of cats‚Äù and all those who are still bored.  To agree on something specific with this camp is very difficult.  It is especially difficult to give them a ready-made solution. <br><br>  Suppose you are less fortunate - you communicate with the gasket.  The path will be more tortuous, it is a fact, but there is one thing that brightens up the situation a little.  Laying - the same bonded person, like you (to the free artists are not relevant), and the problems he has the same, and you can understand it.  But get the same: <br><br>  1. <b>Podstava</b> - a person posing as a body, although in fact it is not a body.  He will steer the process very confidently, directing you in every way, advising and even demanding.  But in the end, it turns out that all that was said was the subject of his own personal initiative, which he never agreed with anyone. <br>  2. <b>Karabasik</b> - by analogy with Karabas, this is a person who wants to actively manipulate you.  The problem is that his desires do not match his rank.  He is called, Dorval.  And you are more likely to suffer if you do not take measures to neutralize it. <br>  3. <b>Susanin</b> - from the name it is clear that he will lead and quit.  In a way, this is a variation of the Stand.  The only thing that Susanin always acts with the best of his motives. <br>  4. <b>Leech</b> - a person who wants to express themselves at your expense.  He does not solve the task, he earns points.  You are just a tool for his career.  And he will treat you accordingly. <br>  5. <b>Dyshlo</b> - this is a difficult case.  Changeable as mercury, constantly changing its point of view, task, conditions.  In this case, most often, he reacts to some kind of irritation within his company.  But since you have no idea about these processes, each successive course change will be a revelation to you. <br>  6. A <b>pale mole</b> is a character who doubts himself.  This is more of a personality problem than an organization, but they often come across as project managers on the client side.  He is very afraid of his own leadership, tossing, doubting and shaking your nerves. <br>  7. <b>Extreme</b> - forced assistant.  Imagine a commercial director who was set to steer the process of creating a site.  He has his mouth full of worries, and here you are ... with all the ensuing consequences. <br><br>  Here, perhaps, that's all.  The list is far from complete and I will be glad if someone complements it with both types and meetings with them, I will be glad - speak out. <br><br>  In the next series we will talk about performers.  I will try not to delay this issue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/959/">https://habr.com/ru/post/959/</a></p>
