  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Security of third-party dependencies - check with snyk</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently there was an excellent publication <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/346442/">‚ÄúA story about how I steal credit card numbers and passwords from visitors to your sites‚Äù</a> , to which I <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/346492/">translated the</a> answer.  The author recently published the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/part-2-how-to-stop-me-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-844f739659b9">second part</a> , but I suspect that there will be no translation - it is proposed to solve the problem in excellent ways, such as translating important input elements ‚Äúinto a separate iframe‚Äù or ‚Äúinto special pages without third-party javascript‚Äù.  At this point, those who led to the first article should have doubted the adequacy of the author - and the low (relative to the previous) rating of the new article shows this. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/347958/">translated yet</a> . <br><br>  Nevertheless, the problem of third-party dependencies is there, and it needs to be solved somehow.  And it costs equally in any ecosystem where third-party dependencies are used.  In the comments to the previous post, we have already requested some solution, and I want to present one of them - a tool called snyk.

He can check dependencies for many ecosystems (Javascript, Ruby, Python, Scala and Java) on his own base - and the authors claim that their base of vulnerabilities is large.  You can <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/%3FpackageManager%3Dall">look</a> at it with my own eyes.  The project code is open, it is on the githaba and it has quite a few stars and forks: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ip/x8/4n/ipx84n_htxbe0lk6pjf6vogxlcw.png"></div><br><h3>  Main features </h3><br>  The description is taken from <a href="https://snyk.io/features">the project site</a> , we make a discount on the marketing bullshit, there are repetitions in the original.

You will also need to log in to the site, it can be done through several services - github, google, bitbucket.  In addition, you can test the package without installation, right on the site - and get a clear report <a href="">like this</a> .  And, of course, you can get a beautiful badge like this: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://snyk.io/test/npm/telegram-test/0.1.5/badge.svg" alt="Known Vulnerabilities"></a> <br><br>  Naturally, you can also integrate it into your CI, but everything is so obvious that you don‚Äôt want to write about it. <br><br><h4>  Using </h4><br>  Once you have installed snyk, it just works.  So far I have tried it only on Node.JS projects, and some unpleasant aftertaste remains.  At a minimum, I noticed that in the absence or in the empty node_modules directory, the check considers that there are no dependencies, and this means that everything is fine in the project.  The fact that you could carry them by hand, they could not be fully established, and so on - is not taken into account.  But in general, the report turned out to be quite good - although in fact it all comes down to keeping the dependencies up to date.  Which is very obvious and without a special tool.  However, we all know that it is not always possible to ‚Äújust pick up and upgrade‚Äù to a new major version, and the presence of a critical vulnerability, which the monitoring tool warned about in time, can serve as a good incentive not to postpone it for a long tomorrow. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ke/i6/qe/kei6qeotfzsv7iwdq1rqhzjxv9e.jpeg"></div><br>  A few more upset the quality of the code of the project itself.  It doesn‚Äôt bother me that it is written in ES5 (although why then is it Babel‚Äôs project?) - but the code itself doesn‚Äôt look very nice.  It also grieves me that I don‚Äôt see active work with pull requests ( <a href="https://github.com/snyk/snyk/pull/128">for example, mine</a> , where I just corrected the problem described above with node_modules - and in general, it seems, <a href="https://github.com/snyk/snyk/pulls%3Fq%3Dis%253Apr%2Bis%253Aclosed">2 of 23 were taken</a> ).  Well, it is strange that the project related to updating and security of the modules itself contains a bunch of obsolete dependencies, and there are a large number of different ‚Äúbikes‚Äù in it. <br><br>  Again, I am somewhat confused by the amount of marketing in a project.  For example, the fact that the verification process itself is called a vulnerability check, and a badge indicates the number of vulnerabilities.  This is not true.  The maximum that snyk checks are vulnerable dependencies, but not vulnerabilities.  These concepts simply can not be replaced.  And in the same way it is impossible to show that the project which is not containing dependences, does not possess vulnerabilities.  This is a terrible substitution of concepts.  Although it is possible that this is just my paranoia - I still consider the awfully hypocritical green lock and the ‚ÄúSecure‚Äù sign in the browser when using SSL ... <br><br>  Anyway, this project has a big plus - it works.  It is claimed and developed.  So I sincerely wish him to become better, and I hope that we will someday have a good and reliable solution for the global problem of dependency vulnerabilities in our projects. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/347934/">https://habr.com/ru/post/347934/</a></p>
