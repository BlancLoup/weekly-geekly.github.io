  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Business in the regions does not understand why he needs a website</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The situation for me, frankly, is incomprehensible.  A couple of times I came across the fact that businessmen from the regions are not in a hurry to make a website for themselves, while in the central part of Russia the situation is many times better.  I do not know what it is connected with, but having talked with two dozen businessmen, who essentially know what the Network is (forums, ICQ, mail), but they don‚Äôt see for themselves the advantages of having a website, even business cards, for their business .  Below I will try to explain to them exactly what advantages it brings.  Immediately after I click the ‚Äúpublish‚Äù button, I will send them a link to <a href="http://absolvo.ru/2008-10-07/biznes-v-regionax-ne-ponimaet-pochemu-emu-nuzhen-sajt/">this page</a> , and then I will post their reaction and opinions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is primarily about small business, the giants of the site, or really do not need, or have long been there.  Having a decent website that is understandable and pleasing to the visitor is suggesting to the potential client that the company is somehow better than the competitor.  For example, there are two companies in the region that are engaged in latch.  One site on the people, with the default design and spelling errors.  And you have a neat, cute and useful site.  The conclusions that the user will make, although vague, are quite transparent for our understanding. <br><br>  Information about your business is available every minute, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  But it is valuable, your phone numbers, contacts, a description of your company and your field of activity.  As a situation, for example, a visitor is looking for information on a certain service in his region, finds your site, and despite the fact that he has now half past two nights from Saturday to Sunday - he finds out almost everything he needs.  As a result, the client may very well write down your phone number and dial you during working hours, in detail, and not find out what you can offer him and how. <br><br>  Moreover, information about the desire to come to you, or a letter with a question, may already be expected by the manager in the morning on the mailbox.  And it is absolutely free for the buyer and convenient for you.  Moreover, the means of feedback simply must be.  You never know, maybe in this way you get an extra client.  Depending on what kind of business you have, this client alone can recoup all the costs of creating the site and supporting it for many months.

      The site allows you to automate some of the work, simplifying the workflow of your employees.  For example, a site shop with elements of a CRM system will allow a customer to choose a product, even a plush toy, pay for it with electronic money, indicate his address and everything, after a while the purchase will be his.  And in the office the order will creep out of the printer near the manager, who will phone with the client, clarify the details and give the order for processing to the logistics department.  Or just a courier.  As a result, a once-configured system will allow you to receive and increase your profits for quite a long time. <br><br>  If you take as an example the same store of plush toys, the presence of detailed descriptions, photos and reviews of the product on the website greatly increases the possibility that the client will come to you.  Create a certain knowledge base of your product, it is useful for buyers and brings profit directly to you. <br><br>  Forget the Yellow Pages.  They are already irrelevant, it is much more profitable and more expedient to spend money on the creation of the site, its promotion and promotion.  This will bring you much more clients than the dead, today, sphere of paper advertising.  Or do you continue to spam waste paper in mailboxes?  Beware - if you throw this spam to me - catch and tear off my legs. <br><br>  So, a little messy, but still I wrote everything I wanted.  To summarize all the above, we can say the following: <br><br>  The absence of a website for your business automatically hides it from an audience that is looking for information almost exclusively through the Web.  And the size of such an audience, read as potential customers, is growing from year to year.  If you do not have a website, then you are losing customers right now.  Capital investments are not so big, but the return on these investments can be very large.  True, it all depends on many factors, for example, on your taste, because it is you who will choose what the site will look like, and if you come up against some kind of soviet design, you will surely do it, but there will be little return from such a page.  It also depends on the site promoters, if they use ugly, or black ways of promotion, then you may not find your website in search engines.  Yes, it is not elementary, but it is worth it - because when you started your business, you did not count on freebies? <br><br>  I do not advertise anything with this post, neither my services, nor the services of the studio in which I work.  Just boiling. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41776/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41776/</a></p>
