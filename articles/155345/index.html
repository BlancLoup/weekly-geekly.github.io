Moscow is probably quite happy with many, but the drawbacks of this solution are obvious.  On Habr√© from time to time ideas are published <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/139574/">to collect more programmers and move to nature</a> , but further discussion of such ideas have not yet advanced.  I decided to go a little further and picked up a suitable option that I would like to discuss. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  A couple of words about the problem </h4><br>  Need a place in which: <br><ul><li>  Everything is in order with the ecology; </li><li>  There is internet; </li><li>  Healthy social environment; </li><li>  A lot of IT people; </li><li>  Acceptable prices; </li></ul><br>  At the same time the place must be in Russia. <br><br>  They <a href="http://www.innopolis.ru/">are trying to do</a> something like <a href="http://www.innopolis.ru/">this in Tatarstan</a> , but the state is doing this, so there is somehow not very cheerful movement there.  Perhaps managers are busy with more traditional things for the budget.  There is also an <a href="http://www.ecoparki.ru/">ecopark "Suzdal"</a> , but there, apparently, is still sadder.  They even didn‚Äôt have enough common sense for a normal website.

    <h4>  What we did </h4><br>  We prepared a presentation, chose a district center in the province, agreed with the administration to meet and asked them to pick us a plot.  Here, of course, we were lucky - we met with people who really care about their land, try to make the city better and understand perfectly well what such a village can give to the region. <br><br>  We were picked up a great site and promised full assistance in all matters of connections, approvals, etc. <br><br><h4>  Plot </h4><br><ul><li>  The road from Moscow - take the train in the evening, the next day by 10 am you can get to this section.  Far away, I agree; </li><li>  Plot size - 24 hectares; </li><li>  One edge of the plot is a sandy beach on the shore of a huge pond of several square kilometers; </li><li>  The second edge of the site is a small forest and a bank of a river that flows into a pond; </li><li>  The site is a two-lane federal highway, which separates the shore of the pond from the main part.  Over the river, of course, the bridge.  The route is planned to move away from the pond after 2014. </li><li>  On the plot there are points for connecting electricity and water.  The optics of Rostelecom pass along the edge of the site, with which a basic agreement on connection has been reached; </li><li>  A few kilometers from the site is a ski resort; </li><li>  On the other side of the pond there is a sailing school and several yachts; </li><li>  A large water park is being built a few kilometers away. </li><li>  The region is a land of dense forests.  In addition to the beauty of nature, this means affordable prices for construction.  For example, in the construction of an elite material - glued laminated timber - one square meter costs about 15 tr.  upon delivery of the house to the finish. </li><li>  To the district center with all the necessary infrastructure - less than 5 minutes by car.  Near the station there is a bus stop; </li></ul><br><br>  The network managed to find a picture of the site from a bird's flight.  You can see only a small piece - the site itself is located on the bottom right. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f92/962/508/f92962508ee436ccf58933753a3d7b7c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We went there in rainy weather, so it was not so beautiful.  Here is a view of the pond itself. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e05/490/8ee/e054908ee9e5401da2217156d4922f89.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is a view of the river: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a69/e5d/d30/a69e5dd300a07f07edab15ad5060afbc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But more or less professional photo of this pond: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fad/fea/e4d/fadfeae4de04b81b2833d2d880a66037.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Issue price </h4><br>  Unfortunately, the cadastral property of such a plot turned out to be much higher than we expected.  Hearing the number, we realized that it would not be possible to acquire it as property.  But the administration offered a fairly acceptable rental option.  For the right to rent you need to pay 2 million rubles, and then - 40 tr.  monthly (2 rubles per square meter per year). <br><br>  We initially planned to take a small loan and try to do it all so to speak with pocket money, but apparently it will not succeed. <br><br><h4>  The essence of the proposal </h4><br>  What we cannot do with one family is quite accessible for several.  At first I was thinking towards finding an investor, but this approach has more disadvantages than advantages.  It is important for an investor to quickly beat off the money and earn money - and, by and large, there is no concern for the social environment that will result.  Therefore, the presence of an investor in such a project, who does not live in this village himself, can have a detrimental effect on the decisions made. <br><br>  Therefore, perhaps, some form of cooperative may work here.  I am not strong in the legal side, but I am sure that with a certain interest from the community, this issue can be somehow solved. <br><br>  If you can work remotely, are not tied to Moscow and the requirements formulated at the beginning of the post are close to you, share - what do you think about this?  If really interesting, write in a personal on Habr√©. <br><br>  UPD <br>  Place - Belaya Kholunitsa, Kirov region. <br><br>  UPD2 <br>  If you would like to participate in the project, and not just talk - write in a personal, not in the comments.  We are already going to several people, we plan to gather a meeting, discuss the details and plan. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155345/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155345/</a></p>
