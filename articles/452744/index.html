  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is there a full life remotes without freelance exchanges?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many read the question, immediately nod their heads.  The pier, of course, exists.  And they will even begin to give examples that actually turn out to be units that have fallen into the field of coaching or literary creation. <br><br>  In reality, everything looks somewhat different, and the proof of this is that there are thousands of successful freelancers who, in spite of the top rating and content recognized name, are in no hurry to leave the space of their favorite <a href="https://www.weblancer.net/">freelance exchange</a> .  And the reasons for this are enough.  Let's figure it out together. <br><br><h2>  Safe and secure </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tv/gx/au/tvgxauzuodliqf3whbg2v2lbjse.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Those who are faced with unscrupulous customers, or worse than cheats, will understand what they mean.  At the stock exchange you always have the opportunity to issue a deal within the service, thereby securing yourself from Ostap Bender.  In case of a controversial issue, the Arbitration intervenes in the process of cooperation, which, as an impartial judge, issues a verdict.

      On the other hand, work through a virtual intermediary is very convenient for decent customers, who calmly make prepayments through a service, but who are wary of remote workers found on the Internet.  A person who has profiles in social networks and even his own website with some reviews, they have more doubts than a registered user of the exchange, even with a small rating.  The reliability of the first is almost impossible to verify, but with the second it is already easier. <br><br><h2>  Without framework, without restrictions </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gu/0r/qm/gu0rqmpmk5kfvtiui_zitpy_0vc.jpeg"><br><br>  Another important point that attracts to the exchange is a variety of projects.  Being outside of it, you will not have such a wide opportunity to choose tasks.  Sausage Kolbasich will find you, say, ‚Äúword of mouth‚Äù, and will offer you to work on the description of the meat delicacies of its production, and your soul lies to the beautiful or you are an ingrained vegetarian.  You can, of course, refuse.  But ... Firstly, it is fraught with the loss of potential earnings, and secondly - it can have a bad effect on reputation, because Sausage Kolbasych can tell about you as an unreliable performer.  And reputation, it is worth a lot. <br><br>  On the stock exchange, you can always leave bids in projects that delight you with the topic, terms of the TK, payment or deadlines, or just the avatar of the customer.  You will have the opportunity to choose tasks based on your personal plans and, possibly, problems.  Not in the mood?  Got sick?  Just close all the windows on the laptop and relax. <br>  Were restored, opened an account, and there are already dozens of interesting projects for you, and you take it with a vengeful force to storm. <br><br><h2>  Less downtime </h2><br>  On the other hand, if there is a lull in work or an urgent need for financial infusions, you can always find a project on the exchange that falls into your hands.  On Weblancer, there are enough new projects for which you can apply for a day.  Agree that in such conditions it is difficult to remain without work. <br><br>  What can not be said about completely free swimming.  No one can guarantee you a constant influx of new orders.  Moreover, they can disappear at the same time, and therefore also appear at the same time, forcing you to sink in deadlines.  And it is very difficult in this case to build a balance and catch a Zen. <br><br><h2>  Confirmed image </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h6/vg/i5/h6vgi5z4lxp9igys38i5bln7jqs.jpeg"><br><br>  A definite plus of freelance exchanges is the rating.  When you develop it and acquire positive reviews, it is very easy to take the desired orders.  To build an image outside of remote work sites is quite difficult. <br><br>  This requires constant investment in the site and advertising in social networks.  In addition, all potential PR channels need to be constantly maintained and developed.  This is again your personal time and possibly financial expenses. <br><br>  The same feedback from customers to get much harder, because they are not up to it.  In addition, the question arises: how to arrange them, that they looked believable?  Reviews today, as you know, the product is very running. <br><br>  On any freelance exchange, all these moments do not cause problems.  They advertise and promote themselves.  The process of receiving feedback brought to automatism.  A letter arrives to the customer with a proposal to leave an impression of cooperation on a saucer with a rim.  He can only print a couple of lines in a special window. <br><br><h2>  About your objections </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rx/lz/xc/rxlzxcwhnu9xgqvxf28hlbpd4km.jpeg"><br><br>  Yes, the life of a remoteer without freelance exchanges, of course, exists, but is it complete?  Agree that starting in the field of distant work is almost impossible without these special portals.  And it is not true that everything is very difficult.  Nobody said it was easy.  It is enough to correctly form an application for the project, and without a rating you can get a decent order.  All top freelancers started like that. <br><br>  By the way, the latter, even if they are overgrown with regular customers, still monitor new projects.  ‚ÄúPermanent‚Äù is not synonymous with ‚Äúeternal‚Äù.  Sooner or later, this constancy ends, and then there is nowhere to run, except on your favorite freelance exchange.  She, as mom will always take back and regret.  Visit any rating user page and see when it was online.  I bet you won‚Äôt even find a couple of people from this community who visited, say, a year ago? <br><br>  And do not confuse freelancers who, having earned a certain experience, create their own companies or agencies and promote their services.  They are already heads, and it is incorrect to call them remotes.  The same applies to those who founded courses on their specialization, and conducts marathons in social networks.  They, too, have already changed their status. <br><br>  It is very difficult for a freelancer who owns his own work on projects according to his specialization, without exchanges.  This succeeds units, and then, as a rule, working on one customer.  But is it 100% freelance when, in fact, you have a boss and, albeit a remote but permanent team? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/452744/">https://habr.com/ru/post/452744/</a></p>
