  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Linux, School, small town</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In pursuit of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/linux/102842/">this</a> post <br><br>  Recently I went to my parents.  My mother is under 50, and this year, after a short break, she will teach computer science at a school for children in grades 6-8 (in general, she is a mathematician, but no one except her).  The municipality had a contract for the supply of Windows, which ends in the fall.  I don‚Äôt know what the terms of the contract are for there (as for me, since it was legally installed on computers, it can no longer become illegal), but as a result, an order came - since October, Linux has been installed on all students' computers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Mom has nothing against him, she says, she looked at a glimpse (a demonstration computer was set up for ten minutes in front of the teachers in the GoronO) - Linux is exactly the same as Windows.  For mom, the main problem is that she has a lot of training material for her on Windows and programs that she will have to adapt for Linux.  This will have to be done during the school year, as the teachers were told about the transition to another OS this week.  As I understand it, children are taught to edit documents in Word, make presentations and simple tables (working with formulas and plotting graphs in Excell), a little bit of photoshop.  I reassured her that OpenOffice is in many ways similar, there will be slight differences in the menu and formula editor, but that's okay.  He told that there is a Gimp - and it will be really difficult to switch to it, because  the differences are much greater. <br><br>  Then she asked what is Mozilla.  Mom was very happy that at least interaction with the Internet is the same as in Windows: the same address bar, if you type "yandex.ru", exactly the same Yandex will open, and not something else.  This will make life much easier for her - as long as she talks about how to use the Internet, she will have time to master other programs.

      Another big difficulty for children is different OS on computers at school and at home.  Before, when they came home, they saw the same Windows.  They could try to do something at home, try to figure out if they did not understand something for a lesson, or dig deeper themselves, and then ask the teacher questions.  Mom often gave them home assignments.  What to do now?  Tell how this or that action can be done in Linux and in Windows?  And speaking of the latter, you will have to be unfounded - the lack of an operating system from Microsoft will be jealously checked by another commission from GORON.  And how much it will be interesting for a child to listen about what and where you should press and adjust, without having a picture in front of you and without being able to repeat all the actions yourself? <br><br>  The most unpleasant - difficulties with the help from outside.  Internet at school is distributed on the local network, the speed is comparable to dial-up.  Access to various resources is limited, and this white-list is a list of approved sites approved by the Ministry of Education, ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù for students.  The word ‚Äúrecommendation‚Äù is perceived by zealous local officials in a peculiar way - they prohibit everything else.  Most of the open domains are mostly homegrown websites of the same general education schools, where you can hardly dig up something using a free operating system (I‚Äôm not talking about software for it).  Needless to say, there is nothing to think about installing updates on computers either? <br><br>  There are no houses with the Internet either - there is no 3g in our Muhosransk with 20 thousand inhabitants, GPRS issues as much as 5kb / s to the mountain, and no one is in a hurry to get to the local network or ADSL in the private sector.  My mom doesn‚Äôt differ by special computer literacy, but there‚Äôs simply no one better - she‚Äôs already preparing most of the school reporting and teaching the secretaries (there are still many unhappy stories connected with it). <br><br>  Can anyone give any practical advice how to help her in this situation? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/102965/">https://habr.com/ru/post/102965/</a></p>
