  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Useful for beginners to play Ingress</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Ingress is a game from Google, representing us a world with augmented reality.  It works only on the android platform.  When the game is running, you see a real world map around us (Ingress uses geolocation), but in addition you see additional objects ‚Äî portals, resonators, and so on.  Portals are usually located on the monuments of our world. <br>  On Habr√© already had a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158841/">review of</a> this game, now I want to tell some useful tips for those who are starting to play. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How do I get an invite? </h4><br>  Yes, the game is still in beta, you need an invite to start the game.  But just the other day, all players of the second level and higher were issued for an invite.  So right now to get an invite can be quite simple.  Although here in the subject line, suddenly someone will share.  Also invite can be obtained in the VKontakte group, or simply request on the website ingress.  I acted in the last way, an invite came in 2 weeks. <br><br><h4>  How do I most quickly raise the level? </h4><br>  Experience in the game is given for different things, but some of them at the first levels are almost impossible to do.  You will most likely not be able to free any enemy portal.  Therefore, you have options (starting with the most inefficient) <br><ul><li>  Recharge resonators.  Requires a lot of energy, gives 10 points for reloading </li><li>  Hack enemy portals.  100 points per action </li><li>  Installation of resonators.  Very effective.  If you find a portal of your faction on which there are less than 8 resonators, immediately rush there and place resonators.  For each set you get 125 points, plus another 250 bonus for the last. </li><li>  Create fields.  Periodically keys fall from the portals.  Take care of them and use them correctly!  If you have a key to the portal, you can link another portal with it (if the line does not intersect with anything).  For this will give 313 points.  But it is much more effective to close the triangle - then in addition to 313 they will give another 1250. <a href="http://www.ingress.com/intel">Watch</a> for portals and keys and create fields in time! </li></ul><br><br><h4>  So I can destroy the enemy portal? </h4>

      First, the portal cannot be destroyed at all, it is possible to destroy the enemy resonators, freeing the portal from them.  But this, most likely, you will not be able to do at the first levels.  A simple example.  The resonator of the first level is 1000 xm.  Level 1 booster deals 150 damage.  But 150 is if you stand exactly on the resonator.  His range is small, the maximum will hit two neighbors, and that is weak.  If the portal is available, then it‚Äôs not a fact that you can physically approach each of the 8 points with resonators.  Pus gps dancing, and you are periodically "blown down" from the point.  The result is that if the resonators are not very close to the portal, then you will torture them to demolish their boosters first level.  You will need them 50-100 pieces, even if there are only 1 level resonators on the portal.  Yes, you have for this time the battery will sit down! <br><br>  At large levels, everything will be easier, there boosters have a decent range.  In the meantime, you have a chance only to finish off almost destroyed portals. <br><br><h4>  How do I put the resonator of the selected level? </h4><br><br>  If you have reached the second level, you have the choice to put a first level or second resonator on the portal.  In terms of protecting the portal and its properties, the difference is small, the top enemy still will endure all this only in this way.  But there is a difference for you.  The portal can have no more than 4 2-level resonators set by you (the number of 1-level resonators is limited to only 8 - the number of slots on the portal).  And it may happen that the resonators of level 1 will run out and you will not be able to fully develop.  What to do? <br><br>  The solution is very simple, do not just click ‚Äúdeploy resonator‚Äù - then the system itself chooses which resonator to install (from the comments - it always puts the minimum level resonator).  Instead, choose ‚Äúupgrade portal‚Äù, scroll to an empty octant, and you have a choice of which resonator to install. <br><br><h4>  How can I shoot a booster of a selected level? </h4><br><br>  Simple hold on the screen and the choice of "fire xmp" to fire automatically with the booster of the maximum available level.  If you want to solve it yourself, find the necessary booster in your inventory, select it and shoot. <br><br><h4>  What determines the distance from the portal to the resonators? </h4><br><br>  From the distance at which you were from the portal, when this resonator was placed.  They stood close, would close (and they would be easier to demolish the enemy), stood at 35 meters, will be at 35 meters.  Further impossible. <br><br><h4>  Can I add a new portal?  Change existing? </h4><br><br>  Yes, you can, but if I'm not mistaken, starting with level 2. <br><br>  Holding on the map brings up a menu through which you can add a portal.  If you are viewing the properties of an existing portal, click on the ‚Äúmore info‚Äù caption under the image, and on the portal description there will be links to replace the photo or correct the information.  Google promises to handle such requests in 2 weeks. <br><br><h4>  Why all this Google? </h4><br><br>  While it is not clear.  While they obviously do not earn on it.  But I think they will. <br><br><h4>  Why all this for us? </h4><br><br>  What do you mean why?  Game after all!  Pumped and all that.  And while playing you are not sitting at the computer, and move around the city.  Very useful!  And at the big levels, I think, it‚Äôs impossible to do without real communication with real players. <br><br><h4>  Anything else you can do here? </h4><br><br>  As far as I understand, you can't do much more.  But the game will evolve.  And so, you can join the community of players Ingress and pumped together.  Yes, I almost forgot.  There is another very interesting feature, remote recharge.  If you have a portal key, you can find it in the inventory, open the portal properties and charge the resonators on it, even if you are not nearby.  It also gives a bit of experience. <br><br>  Update: suggested inserting a picture in the comments: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73d/51e/8cf/73d51e8cf698e2acff26cd3e57867cba.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175407/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175407/</a></p>
