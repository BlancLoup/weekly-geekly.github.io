Of one SEM company wrote to me in response to a question about a vacancy posted on the notorious Head Hunter.  He thought for a few hours, after reading the message on Vkontakte, and answered the following: ‚ÄúYevgeny, you don‚Äôt need to be creative here - if you just wrote to our email, everything would be fine.  No need to be so active and, moreover, my colleague did not appreciate your perseverance. ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A cold sweat struck me - all the vacancies in one way or another indicate creativity, innovative thinking and hyperactivity of applicants for places.  At the same time, it is often proposed to perform work of a completely different orientation - to be a writer, manager, press service, delivery, and service personnel.  I admit, I did not know to laugh at me or cry!  In the evening, over a cup of coffee, I showed this masterpiece to one of the leaders of the 220V promotion department, who was just as shocked by it as mine. <br><br>  There are too many similar companies on the SEM market.  And if we add to them private traders who earn money on the side, while continuing to occupy the chairs in the offices of these companies, then even more.  Each of them, using the skills acquired in the main job, often merges the most valuable thing that can be - the experience of a SEM company, obtained with a high degree of risk.  Of course, some sign nondisclosure documents, but in fact it is absolutely the opposite and no one is, unfortunately, not insured.

      It would seem that you work in a team, study news information and comprehend office Zen.  No, it is necessary to ‚Äúgo to the side‚Äù, make a website like Digital Agentstvo (!) And find some new ‚ÄúLLC‚Äù or ‚ÄúIP‚Äù to play with him in the Head of the DA (!).  Relax, break away from others, throw away a pair of meetings and reports in front of a formidable bosses.  And so, the Network is already beginning to crack at the seams, experiencing a surplus of home-grown specialists and business consultants, who often have not finished school either. <br><br>  Returning to the incident with the response to the vacancy, it became interesting to me to learn the history of this very SEM company.  What if this 32-year-old man is none other than the same SEM missionary who broke away from the next ‚ÄúPromotion Course‚Äù, heard on Skype at the dinner of an independent man.  However, having looked through the photographs of the subject, no signs of business were found.  And, without any doubt, I saw the date of its foundation - 2015.  What kind of office there is at such a company can only be guessed, but, fortunately, I never got to it. <br><br>  I admit, it becomes sad that I get here for such vacancies left in my past.  I am saddening and drinking my cold coffee, thinking about how many offers to recline with the notorious ‚Äúrequires creative, hyperactive and reactive‚Äù in order to find your own kind and easy-going employer?  In addition, I already have one SEM company on my account (up to 10 employees) who rented an office in one of the business centers of St. Petersburg.  Closed in 2015.  It functioned for a couple of years.  She - closed, and you - free.  And hardly anyone will argue that the shift schedule and the second job is not comme il faut in our difficult time of change. <br><br>  It is after such ups and downs that a slight bewilderment arises - where do all these new enthusiasts in the field of SEM-startup come from, wanting easy money at the expense of small and medium-sized businesses?  Those that create streams of meaningless acts of web promotion.  What go to the left of their employers and are given into the hands of crazy customers who change their plans ten times a day;  those that can say goodbye in the morning and ask them to continue working with them that evening  What are we going to promote, gentlemen?  Kits for sunflower seeds?  It may be enough to reinvent the wheel in an already difficult economic situation when AvtoVAZ switches to a four-day working week and reduces the ranks of its employees;  when shopping malls stand with the lights off the Sale windows, and Savage closes the last stores all over Russia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303548/</a></p>
