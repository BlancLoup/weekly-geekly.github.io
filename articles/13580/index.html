  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is the form so important?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A certain time has passed since the start of the project <a href="http://venividi.ru/">venividi.ru</a> and I would like to share the experience and thoughts that have appeared.  The following applies to thematic social networks. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first and main conclusion - do not think that social technology.  networks (blogs, etc.) will attract someone by themselves.  Attract people. <br><br>  Example - you see a terrible site from the nineties, with some awkward samopisnym forum and flashing banners.  Moreover, the people there are actively discussing and writing something.  You do not see any tag clouds, friends, friends of the tapes on this site and you understand that here it is, an unoccupied niche for social services.  network.  Now I will make a reflecting logo, collective blogs and people will go right away. <br>  Will not go. <br>  99 percent of people are indifferent to the way they communicate.  Especially indifferent in a narrow or professional subject. <br>  Examples of this are conferences on auto.ru or a forum on avia.ru. <br>  I think these guys are not even going to drastically change anything.  Nothing will change if they add newfangled chips.  New people will not run into these fiches.  Older "fashionable" projects will not go away. <br><br>  Hence the conclusion two - it applies to investors and startups.  Investor - if they come to you with a presentation asking for $ 20-30k to develop the engine, ask - why not use forum engines with a $ 99 license, and what is the fundamental difference between the forum and blogging approach for thematic niches.

      Startup - do not be in illusions.  Your half-year-old blog blogging sites will be no better than forums launched in 5 minutes - while the script is being downloaded to the server.  That is, they, of course, may be better, but people will not care. <br><br>  Conclusion three - marketing is everything.  Permanent, active and not cheap. <br>  I often meet in presentations in the ‚Äúpromotion and promotion‚Äù section - press releases, work with bloggers, PR motives.  This is all nonsense.  For myself, I determined the sources of constant interest (read traffic) and nonsense.  Nonsense - everything that gives a surge in inappropriate attendance and leaves nothing on the site after itself.  This is my post - this is nonsense for Venivid.  No nonsense - these are themed visitors in sufficient quantity. <br>  These visitors will give the project the first space speed - the backbone of bloggers.  Then he will keep himself in orbit.  People will attract people.  To give such a kick a project needs half a year, a year of active advertising.  And press releases will not help. <br>  That's what you need to ask for money from the investor. <br><br>  I do not claim that blogging projects on various topics do not have the right to life. <br>  I want to say that the project on the same Invision Power Board will be in the same starting conditions as the project based on blogs (and for which everyone so wants a hundred thousand investor money). <br>  And I will add - the project, slyapanny on anything by a group of interesting people "in the subject", will bypass the project made by technicians on AJAX. <br><br>  With regard to the situation on <a href="http://venividi.ru/">venividi.ru</a> and some numbers. <br>  There is a growth, now the order comes about 500 - 600 people.  per day, and scans about 3,000 pages. <br>  If you write in a presentation that the percentage of authors is about 1%, know that you are consciously or unconsciously lying.  At least in the first stage.  They write about 1 out of 3000, that is, 0.033 percent. <br>  Do not save on hosting.  Now the traffic is about 40Gb a month. <br>  The people in the regions are not very ready to watch reports on 5-6MB of photos.  Just as not very ready to load the main page the size of a megabyte (also a photo) - even if the channel is dedicated, traffic is considered. <br><br>  Behind this otklanivayus.  I hope someone my thoughts will help, and maybe even someone will stop :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13580/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13580/</a></p>
