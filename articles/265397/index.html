Instead of building them on an existing application, I used Rails, it worked quickly and efficiently, and I never looked back. <br><br>  I was a developer of PHP literal out with an existing PHP application.  I used it back. <br><br>  <b>What are you working on now?</b> <br><br>  I work for Fun and Plausible Solutions.  We are engaged in consulting, which means I work on the widest range of projects.  Right now, when I answer this question, I am dealing with the client of lostmy.name.  They sell personalized children's books that take advantage of modern technology.  I help them build and scale their online business. <br><br>  I work for a company called Fun and Plausible Solutions.  I‚Äôm working on are extremely varied.  My current client as I am lostmy.name.  They sell personalized children's books that take advantage of technology.  Their e-commerce stack. <br><br>  <b>What do you think is missing from Rails?</b> <br><br>  Good framework for testing.  But seriously, Rails is a surprisingly complete framework.  I think in many moments he even has too many opportunities.  For example, I think the world could do without ActiveRecord callbacks and turbolinks, because of which it is too easy to shoot yourself in the foot. <br><br>  A good testing framework;).  But seriously, Rails is a surprisingly complete framework.  I think in a lot of places, it has too many features.  In particular, I call you back in the foot. <br><br>  <b>Favorite programming language after Ruby, why him?</b> <br><br>  This is a big question.  I grew up in Java and Python, wrote a lot in C, while I was at university, and in many other languages.  I have never ceased to love Java, many misuse it, but in its pure form Java is a great language. <br><br>  This is a kind of a big question.  I grew up on Java and Python, coded a lot of C.  It is a great language. <br><br>  <b>What technology do you think will be the most promising in the near future?</b> <br><br>  I am incredibly pleased with Rust.  His type system and compiler are beautiful, and his security guarantees are simply nothing to compare with. <br><br>  I couldn‚Äôt be more excited to program in Rust.  What are the safety system? <br><br>  <b>What is open source for you?</b> <br><br>  This is a very difficult question.  I think in particular with regard to Ruby, Open Source is a community.  The very fact that I can easily write to Aaron, Zach, or someone else and immediately get help with my insane Ruby problem is very cool.  They also ask me exactly how to do something at RSpec, and I also try to help :) Often this means bringing another maintener to the conversation, because although I am a maintener, my knowledge of RSpec is not encyclopedic. <br><br>  This is a very hard question.  I think around Ruby in particular, Open Source means community.  I can just ping the problem.  I‚Äôm trying to help them out. :)  Of course, it‚Äôs a different way of bringing it up. <br><br>  <b>What news from the world of web development has attracted your attention recently?</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://github.com/rails/actioncable">ActionCable</a> .  Simply no. <br><br>  ActionCable.  Just no. <br><br>  <b>Favorite blogs / websites / twitter on web development and programming?</b> <br><br>  Too much to mention all.  Let's say I think Jen Schiffer is incredibly funny.  Sarah Mei ( <a href="http://twitter.com/saramei">@sarahmei</a> ) is a good friend of mine, and some of her twitter-based discussions about our industry are great.  I also want to highlight two great new members of our community - Kylie Stradley ( <a href="https://twitter.com/kyfast">@kyfast</a> ) and Sara Simon ( <a href="https://twitter.com/sarambsimon">@sarambsimon</a> ). <br><br>  Too many to name.  I will say I am Jen hifarious.  Sarah Mei (@sarahmei) is simply superb.  Two people are like Kylie Stradley (@kyfast) and Sara Simon (@sarambsimon). <br><br>  <b>The last read programming book that you liked?</b> <br><br>  I don't often read programming books, but ‚ÄúJava concurrency in practice‚Äù is an important milestone.  Much of what it teaches is not only about Java, but also about options for considering parallel programming.  She helped me a lot over the years. <br><br>  Concurrency in practice is a great staple.  It is not really a condrent programming.  It was very helpful to me throughout the years. <br><br>  <b>What advice would you give to developers who want to achieve great success?</b> <br><br>  Honestly, I do not think that I have reached a position in which I could give such advice.  I can only share my experience.  I have such a banal background, already sick.  Both parents worked all their life in programming or related fields.  I studied at a good university and received a worthy degree in computer science.  My path is fairly standard for our industry, but this is not necessarily a recipe for success.  Our industry is starting to affect the whole world, and if we don‚Äôt attract people with very different experiences, we‚Äôll end up giving out totally worthless solutions.  However, I can give advice on how to make a successful team: hire people who are different from you, who can challenge your ideas and improve what you are doing. <br><br>  I honestly don't think about it.  I can only talk to my experience.  My background is so stereotypical it hurts.  Both parents have been working for their carers.  I went to a university degree and a good CS degree.  I‚Äôm not sure why I shouldn‚Äôt have been the case.  It is not a problem.  However, you can‚Äôt help you get a successful team: <br><br>  <b>Not tired of programming?</b>  <b>What do you do when you feel something like that?</b> <br><br>  Programming bothers me, but I spend a lot of time at conferences and meeting new people, which recharges me a lot.  I try to refresh my head with a flood of new ideas.  And always helps a cup of good tea. <br><br>  But I‚Äôm Coding, But I‚Äôm Coding.  Mostly, as much as possible into my head.  Also: a cup of tea always helps. <br><br>  <b>What report are you going to listen to at RailsClub (we have simultaneous translation)?</b> <br><br>  I look forward to the speech Koichi, he always tells interesting.  Anna's theme also looks fascinating. <br><br>  I'm very excited about Koichi's talk, he's always interesting.  Anna's talk also looks fascinating. <br><br>  <b>What would you do if you had 2 months of free paid time?</b> <br><br>  I have an initial conceptual sketch of a book in my head.  I think it would be great to spend this time writing a book. <br><br>  I have the initial conceptual stages of a book in my head.  I think getting that into a manuscript form would be great. <br><br>  <b>Who wanted to be in childhood?</b> <br><br>  I wanted to do something about what I do now. <br><br>  Something close to what I'm doing now. <br><br>  <b>What do you generally expect from the conference and from the Russian-speaking community?</b> <br><br>  I am very interested to learn more about how Russians develop Ruby.  I noticed that in different countries where I was, people write code in different ways, it is always interesting to compare and contrast styles. <br><br>  I'm very interested in Ruby.  I find it differently, it‚Äôs nice to compare it. <br><br>  <b>Thanks for the interview and see you in Moscow!</b> <br><br>  All questions that we did not ask, you can ask Sam and our other participants personally - September 26th.  The whole program is on the <a href="http://railsclub.ru/">conference</a> website. <br><br>  At RailsClub, Sam will read a report about mocks. <br><br>  In the report, he will analyze the different ways in which we isolate objects when sharing.  At first glance, they all do the same thing, but in each case there is a special language that reports problems in the structure of our applications. <br>  Consider the different types of test double used in applications, and understand what they say about the architecture of our programs. <br><br>  Registration and payment of participation - <b><a href="https://railsclub.timepad.ru/event/205851/">here</a></b> .
