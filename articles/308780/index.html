  <section class="page js-page"><h1>By 2020, the development of the Internet of Things will invest $ 6 trillion</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Until 2020, $ 6 trillion will be spent on the widespread adoption of the Internet of Things.  BI Intelligence analysts believe that in these 5 years the world economy will change - not only the IT sector.  According to their estimates, by 2020 there will be over 34 billion devices connected to the global network: 10 billion connected to personal computers, smartphones and tablet PCs, and 24 billion connected to the Internet of things. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/35c/1fa/773/35c1fa7735888c1e3700853a333022aa.png" width="700"></div><br>  <em>Site <a href="">image</a> xakep.ru</em> <br><br>  In 2015, the number of IoT-items worldwide amounted to almost 5 billion, and Juniper Research analysts <a href="http://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/iot-connected-devices-to-triple-to-38-bn-by-2020">believe</a> that by 2020 this figure will reach 25-38 billion.  The growing demand for mobile services and OTT-technology will lead to the fact that the network will become the main place for the introduction of innovations and changes.

      However, BI Intelligence analysts indicate three conditions that must be met in order for these changes to occur: <a name="habracut"></a><br>  reducing operating costs, increasing productivity, and expanding the market and product line offers. <br><br>  Improving labor productivity and the standard of living of the population, according to analysts, should remain in the hands of governments.  And then people will be able to acquire more and more wearable gadgets and home equipment, thereby making a significant contribution to the development of high technology. <br><br>  BI Intelligence experts predict that one of the key roles in the IoT market will be played by companies specializing in the production of wearable fitness devices. <br><blockquote>  For example, Fitbit today confidently demonstrates amazing financial results.  Thus, over the past month, the value of shares of this company has grown by 19.01%.  In addition, the developer of IoT technologies and smart networks - Itron, Inc., which has increased by 11%, can boast of quite good financial results today. </blockquote><br>  In the industrial Internet of things market, the key players are such technological giants as General Electric, Siemens and Honeywell International.  According to analysts at Accenture, by 2030 this market will exceed $ 14 trillion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e0/ff7/481/3e0ff7481dc3c45aae7dcf1af232112a.jpg" width="300"><br><br>  EMC Vice President Patrick Wegvart commented on the changes that have occurred in the 124-year-old General Electric business: <br><br><blockquote>  General Electric, which manufactures aircraft engines, was able to transform its service model of service by introducing a system of sensors and software for online analysis of its engine performance.  This innovation made it possible to significantly reduce the equipment repair time and support cost (as the data arrived in time and allowed the service to be performed in advance), increase the equipment life and, accordingly, reliability (which, in turn, became an additional quality indicator in comparison with competitors). <br><br>  In fact, there was a transformation of business, business processes, which made it possible to create a new business, thanks to the modernization and change of IT infrastructure. </blockquote><br>  GE CEO Jeffrey R. Immelt <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/technology/ge-the-124-year-old-software-start-up.html">said</a> that by 2020, the company will be in the top 10 among software development companies. <br><br><h3>  Cooperation with Intel </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c1b/c07/7e4/c1bc077e4bde3d385bfcf78b19c6f824.jpg" width="600"><br><br>  On August 17, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/08/17/how-intel-and-ge-team-plan-to-make-cities-smarter/">it became</a> known that General Electric and Intel made an agreement.  The companies plan to jointly promote in the global market the Predix operating system designed for smart industrial equipment.  The IT giant will be able to integrate its own developments into the operating system, which can help it to become one of the leaders of the upcoming industrial revolution, Intel believes. <br><br>  GE will take over the delivery of operating systems and their further integration with the "smart" equipment of various manufacturers, and Intel will supply digital devices and related software. <br><br>  Thus, Intel developers will use the Predix operating system together with their own software, which will allow them to create a joint proposal with General Electric for the modernization of industrial equipment throughout the planet.  It is expected that this business practice will provide both companies with a significant share of the global industrial Internet market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d3f/a56/185/d3fa561857e7eb55cc3ed4b6f1714642.jpg" width="600"><br><br><blockquote>  The previous joint project of the companies was implemented at the gas turbine plant in Greenville, where today Intel's sensors are used to change the temperature of the turbine air during its welding.  The data thus obtained is sent to the Predix OS cloud service.  This makes it possible to control the automated process of manufacturing turbines in real time, thereby minimizing the risk of thermal deformation of products.  According to the engineers of the plant, the use of such a system has allowed them to save hundreds of thousands of dollars, since the number of defective products has decreased significantly. </blockquote><br>  Successful implementation of a joint project will affect the value of shares of both companies.  Thus, over the past six months, Intel shares rose in price by 23.79%, and General Electric - by 10%. <br><br><h3>  Samsung and IoT </h3><br>  Samsung also continues to grow in the IoT market.  Together with SK Telecom, the largest mobile operator in South Korea, the company will build a single network, LPWAN, to which devices and sensors from all South Korean cities will be connected.  Network deployment should be completed by the end of this year, Business Insider <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-is-building-a-smart-cities-network-in-south-korea-2016-5">reported</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c15/e5e/11e/c15e5e11e71edc0a7b415c3ed1ad540b.jpg" width="500"><br><br><blockquote>  The LPWAN (Low-power Wide-area Network) data transfer standard allows you to send and receive small amounts of information over long distances.  The technology was created specifically for IoT, it is energy efficient and costs much less than traditional cellular communication.  LPWAN typically transfers data from connected water and electricity meters to a utility company's server or data from autonomous weather stations. </blockquote><br>  South Korea today remains one of the world leaders in the penetration of smart technologies into urban life.  And since the two largest technology companies set to work, its separation from other countries will only grow. <br><br>  Samsung can hope that the nation‚Äôs Internet of Things does not become a financial failure.  Firstly, because the network itself is relatively inexpensive.  One big city is enough for one base station to which you can connect up to 2 million devices. <br><br>  And secondly, this network pays off, because it works for the daily needs of people and the city: these are utility systems that start to work more efficiently, and the weather forecast, and other easily monetized things. <br><br>  According to the forecasts of Business Insider experts, in 2015-2019, the cumulative investment of cities in the world on the Internet of things will be $ 97 billion.  And the economic benefit from the deployment of IoT will be $ 421 billion. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0bc/03a/7b7/0bc03a7b7790c2cf96969f67063f17cd.png" width="500"></div><br>  The main consequences of the development of urban IoT systems will be a reduction in traffic intensity, a reduction in air emissions and air pollution, increased safety and more effective interaction of the authorities with the public. <br><br><h3>  IoT in Russia </h3><br>  In Russia, due to the novelty of the market, there are not so many companies that have announced plans to deploy IoT.  Despite the fact that the market is only being formed, experts point <a href="http://iot.ru/riteyl/glavnye-trendy-v-sfere-interneta-veshchey">out</a> several key trends in the domestic segment of the Internet of things. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/408/e67/86b/408e6786b64961dfa81c44923ee13b77.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  <strong>Russian IT companies unite to develop the Internet of Things</strong> <br><blockquote> In 2015, a memorandum on the creation of the ‚ÄúNational Consortium of Industrial Internet‚Äù was signed. <br><br>  Rostec Corporation announced a consortium in order to ensure the cooperation of various participants in building production chains along Industry 4.0, developing standards, and developing new business models. <br><br>  Rostelecom has repeatedly initiated the creation of a consortium in which it sees itself as a participant in specific projects, as an operator of the infrastructure for collecting and processing technological data. <br>  In April 2016, the leadership of the Internet Initiatives Development Fund (IIDF) <a href="http://iot.ru/transportnaya-telematika/minpromtorg_i_frii_protestiruut_internet_veschej">announced</a> that it would test solutions from start-ups in IoT at large business sites. </blockquote><br>  <strong>Customers are primarily interested in a particular benefit.</strong> <br><blockquote>  Customers are interested, first of all, not IoT or M2M, but the specific benefit (in one expression or another) that they will get from adding these innovations to their technological processes, says Viktor Strelkov, first vice president for system integration and software engineering of the Group Technoserv companies. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf there is a task whose solution can be simplified / cheapened and it can be shown that the technology works, moreover, not on slides, but on real pilots ‚Äî customers meet such projects with joy and interest,‚Äù he said. </blockquote><br>  <strong>Domestic solutions are able to compete with Western</strong> <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIf we talk about devices that were entirely designed in Russia and capable of supplanting (and displacing) import analogues, then, of course, import substitution in the field of the Internet of things has become a real trend,‚Äù explains Strelkov.  According to him, from a software point of view, there is a similar picture. </blockquote><br>  <strong>The Internet of Things will accelerate digitalization of production</strong> <br><blockquote>  The transition to digital production will continue.  First of all, design (PDM) will be translated into a figure, since in Russia at this stage several component suppliers are participating.  Informatization in this sector will significantly save time on design, Tatiana Rakitina believes.  Another expected trend is inter-sectoral integration and improvement in the quality of final products. </blockquote><br>  <strong>IoT expects widespread use</strong> <br><blockquote>  The Internet of Things will be distributed in all things familiar to us, for example, in clothes and shoes, predicts Igor Shirokov, general director of LACE.  ‚ÄúThe trends are such that the transmitting devices and batteries are reduced in size, the cost of equipment is reduced, which makes it possible to implement IoT everywhere. </blockquote><br>  But for now, business leaders in Russia are only looking at solutions for the Internet of Things.  IDC analysts conducted a study and found that 30% of companies were interested in the Internet of Things technology and confirmed that they are conducting trial implementations and experiments with these solutions.  But only 9% of respondents already use IoT technology in enterprises in one or another volume. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0aa/ec3/1bf/0aaec31bfeb3a2b64b4fac3639338cc5.jpg"></div><br>  ‚ÄúOver the past two years, companies have figured out what the Internet of things is made of, and started, as they say, there is an elephant in parts, highlighting infrastructure projects and telematics.  If you look at the statistics of the renewal of the infrastructure park for industrial enterprises in Russia, the companies focused on operating activities and improving the efficiency of production processes, ‚Äùdescribes the situation with the Internet of Things in Russia Tatyana Rakitina, director of business development Atriniti (part of the Asteros group) . <br><br>  In her opinion, the Internet of things has become the most significant of all technological world trends.  In Russia, as in other countries, this trend will lead to big changes in the next five years. <br>  ‚ÄúBut it should be understood that Russia is still at the initial stage of development of the so-called‚Äú Industry 4.0 ‚Äù(the concept provides for the use of IoT technologies in enterprises). <br><br>  Following the results of implemented projects ‚Äúsmart networks‚Äù and ‚Äúsmart houses‚Äù (which coincides with traditional IoT segments) in 2014, an understanding of the subject component and possible benefits from the implementation of such projects appeared, as well as the need to ensure security in the world of the Internet of Things for both business and and for individual Internet users, ‚Äùshe adds. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/308780/">https://habr.com/ru/post/308780/</a></p>
