And if three years for a person is a reason to try a liqueur cake for the first time and go to bed an hour later, then three years for an online store is maturity.  This is the period when you realize that you are standing on your feet and are grateful to the hundreds of thousands of customers who trusted you even when you first met them.  We are filled with pathos and pride - for the team and success, for the problems solved and the huge work done.  First of all, we thank you, inhabitants of Geektimes, for criticism and praise, for the experience, for the inspiration for different posts.  We are summing up and staying with you in our personal new year. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/286838/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff3/1f1/6a0/ff31f16a09176b993af03e579b916806.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Statistics that don't lie (hopefully) </h2><br>  Three years ago, Gearbest appeared among Chinese online stores.  We almost immediately decided on our niche: goods for geeks, equipment, components and a bit of all sorts of things for those who prefer to buy everything in one place.  Pretty quickly, we became known around the world - Google Trends tells literally about explosive growth.  Pay attention to the atypical peaks - these are sales periods, especially before the New Year and 11.11, on world shopping day.  Glorious was the hunt, as a wise Kaa would say. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/149/9cb/514/1499cb514a5ecbf3aaabfdadaa8b423e.png">

      And here is the schedule for Russia - we are quite popular in this region. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c5/4d0/fd4/7c54d0fd4d00c90713f276486a4cad12.png"><br><br>  Most of the audience of buyers are men, women are very few.  And in vain - we have a lot of interesting and technological products for the kitchen, comfort in the house, pets, children and everyday work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/01a/015/738/01a01573840a8c64778beba4b2d1e775.png"><br><br>  Basically, on Gearbest go from home, but at work they do not disdain to abuse government traffic.  Be warned - shopping in the workplace is less fun and dangerous for a career. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2b4/27a/3fc/2b427a3fcea27d0a9538fa0500b5deaf.png"><br><br>  According to Alexa, on average, users view 5 pages per session and sit on the site for almost 5 minutes.  But, of course, here the average is even less indicative than the average temperature in the hospital. <br><br><h2>  Following the traditions (we give) </h2><br>  In China, a lot of traditions and customs are connected with birthday.  However, as with all holidays.  There are traditions that are not completely understood by Europeans - for example, if a guest admires some thing in the house, it is customary to give it to him.  Gearbest honors traditions and on its birthday gives discounts on products that our customers especially liked recently.  There are a lot of them - so we created several landing pages that are <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/m-promotion-active-283.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">aggregated into one</a> .  And in this post we will tell about the most popular of the most popular - in general, those who not only liked, but also earned the trust and good reviews. <br><br>  Just a real hit, bestseller, ‚Äúflying away‚Äù and so on - a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tablet-pcs/pp_568071.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Teclast Tbook 16</a> tablet with a 11.6-inch screen.  He has several kill features on board.  The first is two Windows 10 + Android 6.0 operating systems for lovers of 50 OS shades.  The second is the Intel Atom x7-Z8750 64bit Quad Core processor (Cherry Trail), which has media and games.  The third is 8 GB of RAM (albeit only 64 GB of internal memory).  Fourth - Bluetooth 4.0, which allows this tablet for $ 300.99 (yes, just three hundred) to make the control center, for example, a smart home.  The fifth is the OTG technology and the 8500 mAh battery, which turn the tablet into a power bank.  In addition to 300 bucks, there is another payment for the benefits - weight 897 grams. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/66b/f9b/fbd/66bf9bfbd77166351c1a97d828698ad5.jpg"></div><br>  And how <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/ip-cameras/pp_312617.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">about the Sinocam 720P Waterproof IP Camera</a> for $ 19.99?  Waterproof IP-camera, which can find a million methods of application: to monitor the child, pets, the elderly, the sick, who stayed alone at home, etc.  Yes, even for their own garage or garden - even if it is screwed, because of $ 20 a long time will not have to be killed.  The camera detects motion, records and transmits video.  Resolution - 1 MP, but, as they say, everything defines your goals.  Operating temperatures from -20 to +55, that is, in most regions of Russia, it can be used for street surveillance purposes.  In general, the perfect device for simple tasks, training cameras, experiments or training purposes. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3bc/da2/bfc/3bcda2bfc2086cad91074dc8120c093b.jpg"></div><br>  The action camera <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/action-cameras/pp_365568.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Hawkeye Firefly 7S</a> for $ 59.99 is a miniature and very handy thing if you like to shoot your trips, bike rides and enchanting descents from the mountains.  The viewing angle is 120 degrees, a fairly powerful 1050 mAh battery, video recording with a resolution of 2160P, Wi-Fi support ‚Äî everything you need from such a camera is higher than the starting one.  With stabilization, too, everything is good - you can stagger, roll head over heels, and she will become a silent witness to all your fakaps.  But better ride, run and move with pleasure and without injury! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/400/408/3f2/4004083f2cc7bfd8addc7e500da93de4.jpg"></div><br>  Another gadget from the category of pampering - <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/camping/pp_203032.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">binoculars BIJIA</a> for $ 20.29 with a 12-fold approximation.  The device, of course, is not for professionals, but it will be useful for you and your children or younger brothers to finally look at the birds, on the other side of the river, admire the shores from the sea or lake, and examine peaks and cultural monuments.  Binoculars weigh only 277 grams, so it can be easily taken on a journey.  By the way, we recommend life hacking: in almost every city there are roofs or other high-rise buildings for panoramic viewing of the area.  If you look from there around yourself through binoculars, your impressions will be much brighter!  Thanks to the waterproof housing and non-slip surface, the device can be used in rain and snow. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/390/b86/cb1/390b86cb1356427eba6bf00129c9f833.jpg"></div><br>  Are you not tired of Xiaomi yet?  And they continue to do things - and one of the very popular ones is the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-watches/pp_438212.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Xiaomi AMAZFIT</a> smart watch.  They are lightweight, stylish, with a robust classic buckle and more expensive than a different tablet - $ 119.99 at a discount.  But they are worth it: 4 GB of RAM, cardiac monitor, information about missed calls and messages, pedometer, alarm clock, remote music control, 280 mAh battery, IP67 protection.  The watch is compatible with smartphones running Android 4.4 / iOS 7.0 and higher.  Silicone strap, ceramic case - the watch looks very stylish absolutely on any hand. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/766/b35/3ff/766b353ff2669b06b6400e602f17a85e.jpg"></div><br>  No gadgets like happy geeks - the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/exercise-fitness/pp_179563.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Force Ball</a> wrist <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/exercise-fitness/pp_179563.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">simulator</a> with a built-in counter and backlight is in great demand.  If you haven't tried it, be sure to try it - it coaches and relaxes your hands (and wrists and fingers) after sitting for hours at a computer, playing a musical instrument, changing a surgeon in an operating room - that is, hard work of your hands in about one position.  If the power ball is in the hands of a girl, then even the forearms work.  Especially since the ball is worth only $ 10.99 for a promotion - try boldly, you'll like it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e69/55e/707/e6955e7075462c9f39189109fb3f5a61.jpg"></div><br>  Spring is a time of buggy, such as the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/rc-cars/pp_328270.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">JLB 2.4G Cheetah</a> - a powerful and aggressive almost unkillable car that can be truly off-road: pebbles, rubble, sand, Russian primer, arable land, tidal seashore, 60-degree hill, etc.  Huge bigfoot tires and independent suspension allow you to move at a good speed of 70-80 km / h without fear of losing the wheel.  The time of continuous work is a little more than half an hour.  This is enough to gather a crowd of onlookers in the city or take part in competitions of such toys.  It is worth the car more expensive than their relatives, even with a discount of $ 264.39, but JBL is almost the BMW of the toy buggy world. <br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/rc-cars/pp_328270.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/981/481/11c/98148111ca6cde35cf612df6349a4081.jpg"></a> </div><br><h2>  The best-selling products (so many people can not be wrong) </h2><br>  In our reviews, we have already mentioned the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_337314.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Anet A8 Desktop 3D Printer 3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY Kit</a> , and it really won the hearts of DIY enthusiasts.  This is not just a 3D printer - it is an assembly kit, that is, before you print the first model, you will have to assemble the printer itself.  In the process of assembling, you will not only understand the principles of operation and study the device of a 3D printer, but also appreciate its steel case, which has reinforced ribs.  After collecting the model, you (including with the child) can begin to print using a 1.75 mm plastic thread (PLA, ABS and other types of plastic).  The printer will not take up much space (410 x 480 x 450 mm), but it weighs a lot - 11 kg, so it‚Äôs better to think about a stationary place for it, rather than transfer it from table to table.  By the way, while the printer costs only $ 159.99 with a coupon <b>GB3drA8fr</b> .
