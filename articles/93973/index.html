We make heading and the text of the announcement</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Let me remind you what we did in the previous series.  We passed an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/context/93845/">introductory briefing</a> and weighed all the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/context/93765/">pros and cons of Ya. Direct</a> as a channel for the development of our business. <br>  It is time to create a great ad, the CTR of which will delight us and anger our competitors. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's start with the trivial, at first glance, concepts.  Before you begin, once and for all you need to realize the following fundamental things: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      1. The Yandex.Direct client wants to get what he is looking for, not what you insist on offering; <br>  2. The buyer on the Internet is greedy and wants to get ‚Äúmore goods for the same money‚Äù; <br>  3. A large number of identical advertisers leads to customer disorientation (the problem of Buridan's donkey).  When there is plenty to choose from - it is unbearably difficult to make a choice. <br>  4. A customer who is looking for a product in Yandex is subconsciously ready to purchase (including item 1) <br>  5. A large number of ads in the Directive leads to the fact that they become similar to each other (see an example).  To speak about the presence of <a href="http://www.marketopedia.ru/43-unikalnoe-torgovoe-predlozhenie-utp.html">UTP</a> in this case means not to see obvious things. <br>  6. The transaction is made not at the box office or on your site, in the brain of the client at the moment when he reads these or other announcements. <br>  7. The choice of the client in most cases falls on the ad, as close as possible to his request. <br>  8. The concept of USP gradually dies. <br>  9. GOLDEN RULE: THE RULE OF THE FIRST - ON YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT SHOULD BE CLICKED FOR FIRST. <br>  10. Everything else has absolutely no meaning. <br><br>  All the clever, in quotes, conversations of specialists from the RA about such things as ‚Äúecho‚Äù, ‚Äúsubconsciousness‚Äù, ‚Äúgrab attention‚Äù, ‚Äúbranding‚Äù, ‚Äúimage component‚Äù in 99.9% of cases are nothing but nonsense and are nothing more than a fully conscious, special complication of the process of work.  With a client so disoriented by such cool terms, it's much easier to manage. <br><br>  The main goal of this approach is to put the RA in a favorable light, to justify its shortcomings and ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù spend the budget.  However, everyone makes money the way it can, and it is not for us to judge this. <br><br>  As mentioned above, today there are very big problems with UTP in view of very tough competition (unless you are a monopolist in the production and sale of a unique product ‚Äúby ear‚Äù, which is possible, but unlikely). <br><br>  <b>Title and ad text tasks</b> <br><br>  To give the client what he is looking for - but always in the best light.  In other words, the ad must be relevant (match) the request of the seeker, but with an eye to the texts of competitors.  Focus not on your favorite product, not on customers, but on competitors.  All other paths lead nowhere. <br><br>  For example, if a person is looking for ‚Äú <i>selling air conditioners,</i> ‚Äù you must show him an advertisement for the sale of air conditioners, but containing a more profitable offer than competitors.  In the language of marketers, this is called UTP - Unique Trading Offer. <br><br>  Obviously, when requesting "repair of air conditioners", showing "sale of air conditioners" is not only stupid, but also extremely unprofitable (there may be talk about saying that an ad can work with the return of media advertising, etc.). <br><br>  Be prepared for the fact that you are accused of all mortal sins, amateurishness, lack of understanding of business processes, alpha and omega rays, sigma six and subtle matter (consumer psychology), will bring a thousand, at first glance, quite "convincing" examples from life (references to Ogilvy‚Äôs works will be given accurately), accusing him of illiteracy, etc.  In short, do not pay attention to this nonsense. <br><br>  Let us turn to the specifics.  For the purity of the experiment, we take as an example a competitive request and actually broadcast ads in Yandex Direct.  Further, as a result of the analysis, we will select the optimal variant of the title and text of our advertisement. <br><br>  So, request " <i>sale of air conditioners</i> ."  As you already know, Yandex Direct in the ad text highlights in bold the matching words from the request.  Below these words we will highlight.  Now we go to Yandex, look for and watch Yandex Ads (the geography of the request is Moscow). <br><br>  Special accommodations <br><br>  <b>Looking for air conditioning?</b> <br>  We know what you need for you! <br>  <a href="http://www.xxx.xx/">www.xxx.xx</a> ¬∑ Moscow <br><br>  Yeah, looking ... let's go on looking. <br><br>  <b>Air conditioners are here!</b> <br>  Sale of air conditioners.  Low prices.  Big choice.  Delivery.  Consultation. <br>  <a href="http://www.yyy.yy/">www.yyy.yy</a> ¬∑ Moscow <br><br>  Again low prices.  Give us at least one self-respecting capitalist who does not deliver the goods. <br><br>  Guaranteed and dynamic displays <br><br>  <b>Installation of air conditioners</b> <br>  Fast, high quality, reasonable prices. <br>  <a href="http://www.zzz.zz/">www.zzz.zz</a> ¬∑ Moscow <br><br>  Gentlemen, we need to buy, and you offer installation. <br><br>  <b>Air conditioners.</b>  <b>Special offer</b> <br>  For office and public premises.  Low prices.  Installment plan  Warranty. <br>  <a href="http://www.aaa.aa/">www.aaa.aa</a> ¬∑ Moscow <br><br>  And what is the meaning of special offers?  And there is no time, stomped look further. <br>  <b>Air conditioners for your home!</b> <br>  Professional selection, high-quality installation, warranty! <br>  <a href="http://www.bbb.bb/">www.bbb.bb</a> ¬∑ Moscow <br><br>  Show us the idiot who voluntarily admits to the low quality of installation, installation, or, say, a 2-hour warranty instead of a 2-year warranty. <br><br>  <b>Sale of all types of air conditioners</b> <br>  Sale of air conditioners: from household to industrial.  Low prices!  Installation. <br>  <a href="http://www.ccc.cc/">www.ccc.cc</a> ¬∑ Moscow <br><br>  Again low prices ... such a high-tech device can not have a low price, if it is not a cheap fake. <br><br>  <b>Sale of air conditioners</b> <br>  The leading brands of air conditioners - delivery, installation, service.  Warranty.  Opt. <br>  <a href="http://www.ddd.dd/">www.ddd.dd</a> <br><br>  Opt?  Then I'm not your client ... <br><br>  Air conditioners - installation 24 hours! <br>  Daikin, Panasonic, LG, Samsung, Sharp, Mitsubishi.  Winter prices.  Warranty. <br>  <a href="http://www.eee.ee/">www.eee.ee</a> ¬∑ Moscow <br><br>  24 hours?  And what gives us round-the-clock fixing?  At night we sleep.  Winter prices?  What is winter prices?  In the summer you rob us? <br><br>  <b>Air conditioning - cheap and fast!</b> <br>  Reliable SANYO conditioners at the favorable prices!  Installation at a convenient time. <br>  <a href="http://www.fff.ff/">www.fff.ff</a> ¬∑ Moscow <br><br>  Cheap and fast?  I do not believe!  (with) <br><br>  <b>Installation, sale of air conditioners!</b> <br>  Air conditioners!  Installation 24 hours!  Air Conditioning Catalog!  Discounts on air conditioners! <br>  <a href="http://www.ggg.gg/">www.ggg.gg</a> ¬∑ Moscow <br><br>  No matter how much you repeat, "air conditioners" - sales will not grow. <br><br>  Now look at this ‚Äústream of consciousness‚Äù and reread paragraph 5 again.  A large number of ads in Yandex.Direct leads to the fact that they become similar to each other.  To speak about the presence of UTP in this case means not to see obvious things.  Okay.  Suppose we are one of the competing firms of this list.  Let's work for the marketer of this company: <br><br>  <b>Sale of air conditioners</b> <br>  The leading brands of air conditioners - delivery, installation, service.  Warranty.  Opt. <br>  <a href="http://www.ddd.dd/">www.ddd.dd</a> <br><br>  We make the correct announcement <br><br>  To do this, we need to go to the <a href="http://wordstat.yandex.ru/">word selection</a> page and type in our search box ‚Äúsale of air conditioners‚Äù (after specifying the Moscow region).  Go to the word selection page, analyze the picture and select all those queries that overlap with our activities. <br><br>  sale of air conditioners 3137 <br>  conditioner sale installation 289 <br>  sale of daikin 91 air conditioners <br>  air conditioner for sale moscow 89 <br>  sale of air conditioners lg 62 <br>  sale installation of air conditioners 45 <br><br>  Carefully study the column on the right: ‚Äúwhat else were people looking for‚Äù with this query: <br><br>  installation of air conditioners 10379 <br>  conditioners moscow 906 <br>  air conditioning installation 10379 <br>  installation of air conditioners 2957 <br>  air conditioners mitsubishi 3221 <br><br>  So, we have formed the core of key phrases that overlap the interests of the majority of users who are overwhelming with tanks, searching for the notorious query ‚Äúsale of air conditioners‚Äù.  Now we are going to create a header.  You already know that the header should contain a query or part of it, or rather, a keyword.  In our case - this is the sale of air conditioners. <br><br>  Next, go to the company's website (I am very afraid to post any links to commercial sites in Habr√©, so I will not post a link ... you can open any site on the subject of air conditioners and repeat the experiment), and analyze the picture.  We see the word "Sale".  Very good, but we will not use it, because  they sell only discounted, low-quality or out-of-fashion goods.  We will apply another method that will distinguish us from the gray mass of ads. <br><br>  Pay attention to the key phrase on the site: the price of 13,000 rubles.  This promise will be our foundation.  Of course, someone would prefer, for a long time without thinking, to draw the mantra ‚ÄúBuy, pliz, conditioner ...‚Äù (by the way, this is a thought), but we will go another way. <br><br>  Here's how the headline of our air conditioner ads will look like: <br><br>  Air conditioners from 13000 r.!  Hurry up! <br><br>  In this uncomplicated (at first glance) text, we inform the buyer of the simple idea that without going over the ad, he may be late for something seductive .. It‚Äôs time for the ad text, that's how we issue it: <br><br>  Sale, installation of air conditioners Mitsubishi, Daikin, LG ... Installation!  Call! <br><br>  Total our basic ad will look like this: <br><br>  Air conditioners from 13000 r.!  Hurry up! <br>  Sale, installation of air conditioners Mitsubishi, Daikin, LG ... Installation!  Call! <br>  <a href="http://www.ddd.dd/">www.ddd.dd</a> ¬∑ Moscow <br><br>  Please note: all words except ‚Äúfrom 13000 r‚Äù, ‚Äúhurry!‚Äù And ‚Äúcall‚Äù, and they have an extremely important semantic meaning, perfectly correspond (ie, relevant) to the queries that users enter in the address bar. <br><br>  With the expression ‚Äúfrom 13,000 r.‚Äù We achieve that we have air conditioners from the most democratic to the elite.  But, pay attention, this expression is not similar to the dumbest slogan of the present - ‚ÄúLow prices!‚Äù.  ‚ÄúHurry up!‚Äù And ‚ÄúCall!‚Äù Are important verbs that encourage a potential client to take action. <br><br>  So, once again ‚Äúfix the material". What have we done? We bought the request ‚Äúsale of air conditioners‚Äù and made an announcement that most closely corresponded to the requests of users. At the same time, there is a subtlety. To cover the maximum number of buyers, you need to buy and create ads for the request ‚Äúinstallation of air conditioners "And all the phrases intersecting with it (see the phrases above.) For example, thus: <br><br>  Installation of air conditioners from 5000 p.!  Hurry up! <br>  Sale, installation of air conditioners Mitsubishi, Daikin, LG ... Installation!  Call! <br>  <a href="http://www.ddd.dd/">www.ddd.dd</a> Moscow <br><br>  As you can see from the ad, we put the keyword ‚Äúinstallation‚Äù in the ad headline.  Thus, by combining words from our basic universal text and heading, we can get the optimal number of ads that span the maximum market segment. <br><br>  At the exit we get a wrapper of ads, each of which responds to a specific user request. <br><br>  Air conditioners from 13000 r.!  Hurry up!  (request: sale of air conditioners) <br>  Sale, installation of air conditioners Mitsubishi, Daikin, LG ... Installation!  Call! <br>  <a href="http://www.ddd.dd/">www.ddd.dd</a> Moscow <br><br>  Installation of air conditioners from 13000 p.!  Hurry up!  (request: installation of air conditioners) <br>  Sale, installation of air conditioners Mitsubishi, Daikin, LG ... Installation!  Call! <br>  <a href="http://www.ddd.dd/">www.ddd.dd</a> Moscow <br><br>  Installation of air conditioners!  Call!  (request: installation of air conditioners) <br>  Sale, installation of air conditioners Mitsubishi, Daikin, LG ... Installation!  Hurry up! <br>  <a href="http://www.ddd.dd/">www.ddd.dd</a> Moscow <br><br>  Air conditioners from 13000 r.!  (request: air conditioners Moscow) <br>  Sale of air conditioners Mitsubishi, Daikin, LG ... In Moscow!  Hurry up! <br>  <a href="http://www.ddd.dd/">www.ddd.dd</a> Moscow <br><br>  Mitsubishi air conditioners!  Call!  (request: air conditioners + Mitsubishi) <br>  Sale, installation of air conditioners Mitsubishi, Daikin, LG ... Installation!  Call! <br>  <a href="http://www.ddd.dd/">www.ddd.dd</a> Moscow <br><br>  Daikin conditioners!  Call!  (request: air conditioners + Daikin) <br>  Sale, installation of air conditioners Mitsubishi, Daikin, LG ... Installation!  Call! <br>  <a href="http://www.ddd.dd/">www.ddd.dd</a> Moscow <br><br>  LG air conditioners!  Call!  (request: air conditioners + LG) <br>  Sale, installation of air conditioners Mitsubishi, Daikin, LG ... Installation!  Call! <br>  <a href="http://www.ddd.dd/">www.ddd.dd</a> Moscow <br><br>  Take a close look at the list of ads: it covers approximately 21176 (!) User requests.  Is it worth talking about who will then smear black caviar on bread? <br><br>  Of course, if we were aware of the company's internal cuisine, we would have been able to more accurately determine the competitive advantages and our announcement would have turned out to be more focused.  However, even in the experiment, we completely followed the process of correctly constructing the text and the title of the advertisement. <br><br>  If you want to achieve 100% success, always make up a separate ad for each request, and do not group (as usually, RA will ‚Äúdo‚Äù for you and will smile sweetly with a sense of accomplishment) all requests into one stupid ad.  In this way, you will insure your campaign against mistakes and be more mobile than competitors.  And do not forget about stop words and direct operators.  Their proper use will be discussed in the following series. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93973/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93973/</a></p>
