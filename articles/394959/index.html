It happened 22 years ago.  Nevertheless, Sheitan did not lose hope, and tried to create using methods available to him.  He managed to improve his abilities and become an artist.  He does not paint on canvas, but works with live material, drawing directly on the skin of people.  Yes, Sheitan became a tattoo master. <br><br>  And a few days ago, he received a long-awaited thing - a prosthetic arm in the style of steampunk, which works as a tattoo machine.  This prosthesis was created by Jean-Louis Gonzalez, an engineer and also an artist.  Not long ago, Gonzalez showed his prosthesis at Tattoo Motor Show 8, France.  According to him, at the meeting, people admired the project.  At first, few people understood what he saw in front of him, but then, upon learning about the purpose of the prosthesis, the visitors of the show were enthusiastic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/422/459/287/422459287eaaf4659d3704f77120264b.jpg">

      And initially the project itself was positioned as a "kinetic sculpture."  But after the prosthesis received a lot of positive reviews, its authors decided to slightly change the functionality of the prosthesis, turning it into a real tattoo machine. <br><br>  After the upgrade, it all worked.  Tenet tested the system at work, and after a small workout, I got the hang of working with this tool. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xRYthwLRkOQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjJ9nvpuBV25BQwdjDDGgpBqXsD7g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In order for everything to work as planned, the system had to meet the following criteria: not be too heavy, so that the master could freely hold the prosthesis on the weight, turn at any angle and be reliable.  In the hybrid prosthesis assembled parts of the sewing machine and player. <br><br>  Now all movements of the prosthesis are carried out by the shoulder of the right hand.  But in the future, the authors of the project hope to refine the system, giving it a certain degree of freedom in the wrist area.  In this case, the prosthesis will become even more functional. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b46/a46/95e/b46a4695e15e44d095218eb5dfd1e610.jpg"><br><br>  As for this system, the needles, tubes, rubber gasket and other parts are disposable, they are changed in the same way as the parts of an ordinary tattoo machine after work.  The machine itself and the prosthesis are cleaned without problems - the author does it after each client.  Well, and since it was decided to make a prosthesis in the style of steampunk, the body was given the old look.  Rust or dirt is in fact the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe authors of the project, and made artificially. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/92b/f58/cb7/92bf58cb73e37c8f13746013073d9ab1.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúWe first created an exhibit for the exhibition, turning it into something I could use,‚Äù says Tenet.  "We understood that we did not need to create a prosthesis that copies the arm, we just decided to create a tool that works better than the arm." <br><br>  The prosthesis exists in a single copy, you cannot buy it yet.  Perhaps the authors of the project will arrange the sale of such devices, but they cannot name the exact date of the start of sales. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394959/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394959/</a></p>
