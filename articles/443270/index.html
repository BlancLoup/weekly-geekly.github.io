However, moving forward does not leave in the past the usual philosophy and brand values ‚Äã‚Äã- the return of the purple case emphasizes the continuity of generations and pays tribute to the aesthetics of past Xperia models.  The smartphone was introduced on February 25 at the annual Mobile World Congress. <a name="habracut"></a>  If you talk about him with dry facts, this is how the list of the most important things this model offers: <br><br><ul><li>  Sony Xperia 1 is the world's first smartphone equipped with a 6.5 "4K OLED CinemaWide display with a 21: 9 aspect ratio and HDR remastering technology </li><li>  For the first time in the world, the smartphone with a triple camera uses autofocus on the eyes and provides the ability to shoot up to 10 frames per second with automatic control of focus and exposure </li><li>  The smartphone implements the advanced display settings mode Creator mode (with ITU-R BT.2020 support and 10-bit tonal gradation), as well as the new video feature Cinema Pro based on cineAlta‚Äôs cinematographic technologies </li><li>  Sony Xperia 1 incorporates Dolby Atmos multidimensional realistic sound technology to fully immerse yourself in a movie atmosphere, with joint tuning with Sony Pictures Entertainment </li><li>  The new screen format offers more opportunities for productive work by simultaneously running two applications on a 21: 9 display. </li></ul><br>  The updated design of the Xperia 1 emphasizes the display 21: 9 and, due to its brevity, over time will not lose relevance.  The smartphone looks expensive and solid.  He does not pursue short-term trends, sacrificing usability, but instead offers a classic and comfortable exterior to use.  The metal side is combined with durable glass panels Corning Gorilla Glass 6. The main camera is located exactly in the center at the top of the rear panel.  The thickness of the frames on the front side is reduced to a minimum, when they are no longer striking, but do not overlap some of the content with figured cutouts.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5m/16/lg/5m16lgf9eplt6rxwzroeiofj1ha.png"><br><br>  The engineers decided not to use the 21: 9 screen.  And this is not even a design move that would allow a smartphone to be distinguished from other models, but a solution due to new technologies.  These proportions are ideal for using two split-screen applications at the same time.  This allows symmetrically separating the windows in 1: 1 mode, or giving a classic 16: 9 format to one application and at the same time leaving enough screen space to work with the second application.  By the way, for a more convenient launch of a multi-window mode, its support has been added to the improved Side Sense sidebar menu, as well as a voice command is available. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wr/jj/5a/wrjj5axuzpbfmej8bdfkkebbppi.jpeg"><br><br>  The cinematographic format of the display is also used to uncover new image transfer technologies and to ensure complete immersion in films, as well as accurate transfer of shades exactly as they were intended by the director.  The Xperia 1 display is based on BRAVIA TV technology.  The X1 algorithm for mobile devices increases the dynamic range of the image to HDR, providing high contrast, saturation and clarity of any content.  Xperia 1 supports 10-bit coding of gradation of tones (2 bits are added to the standard 8 bits for smoothing) with the display of a large number of shades. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mo/au/pa/moaupaipjrunfibyxahf2fk86lg.jpeg"><br><br>  Thanks to the professional technology of Sony, which is used to create films by leading Hollywood film studios, it is possible to see colors exactly as they were seen when working on master monitors.  The new Creator mode provides this opportunity by using the ITU-R BT.2020, DCI-P3 and Illuminant D65 color spaces.  Netflix has already appreciated this Xperia 1 feature and confirmed that smartphones are indeed capable of delivering the claimed color accuracy.  The Netflix application will add the ability to automatically enable Creator mode when viewing related content.  The image quality also complements the support for Dolby Atmos multidimensional sound, which surrounds and envelops the viewer with breathtaking realism.  Sound tuning in Xperia 1 was carried out in conjunction with experts from Sony Pictures Entertainment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yp/ag/mz/ypagmzgrihn2tbmg2uzf_tbxvcc.jpeg"><br><br>  Another important aspect of the screen Sony Xperia 1 - new features for mobile games.  A widescreen display with an aspect ratio of 21: 9 gives more space for gameplay, while Game Enhancer technology optimizes smartphone performance and blocks unwanted notifications, allowing you to record the course of the game and find tips that help you achieve even better results.  Some gaming studios have already managed to evaluate the prospects of the new flagship Sony and announced the release of special versions optimized for the new screen proportions, for example, Fortnite, Asphalt 9 and Arena of Valor.  Of course, Xperia 1 offers enough power to run any games with the highest possible graphics settings.  For this is the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor with support for Snapdragon Elite Gaming technology and 6 GB of RAM.  It provides all of this with energy, a powerful battery with a capacity of 3330 mAh, supporting the proprietary technologies Smart Stamina, Battery Care and Xperia Adaptive Charging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gw/zz/5p/gwzz5p40ed130rzhaw1tqlb7roi.jpeg"><br><br>  Sony Xperia 1 was created not only for the consumption of content, but also offers a new opportunity to independently create it.  The smartphone now uses a triple camera with a resolution of 12 megapixels for the professional quality of each shot in any situation and in any light.  For shooting spectacular landscapes or architecture of narrow European streets, an ultra wide 16 mm lens is provided;  A 26-mm universal lens is best suited for everyday shooting, and a 52-mm telephoto lens (equivalent to a 35-mm lens for a full-frame matrix) works perfectly for portraits and distant objects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h-/-b/ys/h--bysxhuq-xnbad17tisttqpmi.jpeg"><br><br>  Sony Œ± camera technologies formed the basis of the BIONZ X chip for mobile devices in Xperia 1. The developed algorithm for the first time offers the possibility of autofocusing on the eyes for smartphones, which allows you to get the most clear photos and conduct continuous shooting up to 10 frames per second with automatic exposure control.  When shooting in low light conditions, the high-aperture lens with f / 1.6 aperture and the Dual Photo Diode matrix with large 1.4 Œºm pixels ensure that even moving objects will not be blurred, and reducing the noise in the RAW mode allows you to get beautiful and clear shots the most difficult lighting conditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8i/cy/03/8icy03wjggwtrr6uedu0surkjfi.jpeg"><br><br>  The Xperia 1 video was taken to a whole new level thanks to the collaboration with the engineers of the CineAlta division, which gained worldwide fame with the VENICE full-frame digital movie camera.  The smartphone shoots with real cinematic quality, and with the help of the new Cinema Pro function and ready-made color correction presets, it is possible to shoot video with such colors as if it was done on a professional camera and underwent a color correction procedure.  What is important, it happens in real time, and not implemented in the form of filters.  The choice of users is offered 8 presets, shooting can be carried out in 4K HDR resolution with a frequency of 24 frames per second and in 21: 9 format.  Complements this unique system of hybrid stabilization Optical SteadyShot, eliminating jitter when shooting pictures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qs/ph/ph/qsphpho65vvuoadhelu-vrv0v00.png"><br><br>  Owners of Xperia 1 will be able to complement their smartphone with new accessories: Bluetooth SBH82D stereo headset with open sound technology and Style Cover Touch SCTI30 case cover with a transparent cover that provides constant access to smartphone features.  Sony Xperia 1 will go on sale in the second quarter of 2019 and will be available in four colors: black, purple, gray and white. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443270/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443270/</a></p>
