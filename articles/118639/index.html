      Your Voice SIM card must be forwarded to one of the redirection services exactly before departure.  It‚Äôs difficult to find cheaper magic.mtt.ru from simple ways - forwarding calls to Europe to mobile phones at 3.99 r per minute, Moscow number in 499 code 300 r per month.  There is a difficult path, for example, from crossing a megaphone multi-phone, pbxes.com and rynga.com, to read, for example, <a href="http://users.livejournal.com/olorin_/925665.html">here</a> <br><br>  If you want to play it safe, you can buy a simtravel SIM card in Moscow's seventh continent for 350 rubles from $ 10 on your balance, but you only need it from the plane on the way to the airport to your relatives, which flew.  Well, or catch the call until the purchase of a local SIM card. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The second. <br>  We leave, we buy at the airport a sim card of one of the local operators.  Pripayidov here until two: <br>  <a href="http://www.cytamobile-vodafone.com/Default.aspx%3FID%3D611">Cyta Soeasy</a> worth 15 euros, 5 euros on the balance sheet. <br>  And <a href="http://www.mtn.com.cy/index.cfm/id/39/lang/english/mtnpayasyougo">MTN Payasyougo costs</a> 12.5 euros, 5 euros on the balance. <br><br>  On both - all incoming calls are free, calls to Moscow, St. Petersburg and all Russian mobile 12.47 eurocents are less than 5 rubles! .. Replenishment cards for both operators are sold at every corner, and at par.  It is not difficult to replenish them through the Internet with credit cards. <br>  The difference is MTN is younger than Cyta, the coverage in the mountains is slightly worse, but all the settlements are covered by both operators <br>  And yet, there is no Internet in CytaSoeasy, you need to buy a separate SIM card for it, which is not available anywhere, MTN Payasyougo has Internet access, so just for 0.99 euros per megabyte, BUT there are <a href="http://www.mtn.com.cy/index.cfm/id/330/lang/english/mtnpayasyousurf">packages</a> .  In short - if we need 80 megabytes for a week - send sms to number 6040 with the text data on week.  I spent a week on the LG optimus One less than 60 megabytes, not limiting myself with anything.  So, bought, inserted into the phone.  We set up a call forwarding service to a Cyprus number - there is free wifi for this at the airport.  If you need to take an SMS to the old number, insert the old SIM card into a 500-ruble handset prepared in advance and read it once a day. <br><br>  Thirdly, we solved the problem with telephone communication, we go to the hotel.  Internet is usually there only in the lobby - ask for the network key at the reception.  This is enough for someone, but someone needs to get out of the netbook more often and from the room, from catering outlets in the city.  In the rooms, the hotel wifi usually does not finish off, and some citycell and redwifi are caught from the window.  We try. <br>  <a href="http://redwifi.primetel.com.cy/">Redwifi</a> points a lot, register online, pay by credit card, it costs 20 euros per week.  I worked more or less stably.  A couple of times a week fell off. <br>  <a href="http://www.citycellhotspot.com/">citycell</a> Points even more, costs 25 euros per week, but there was no online registration, and I was lazy to call.  According to reviews, it works well. <br>  Yes, in some cafes there is free wifi, in some of them paid, in the same Starbucks.  McDonald's did not disappoint, free wifi was found in it. <br><br>  Fourth - Money.  In the Republic of Cyprus is full of Russian banks.  Personally, I shot from the ATM of the Cyprus branch of Promsvyazbank (at a preferential rate without a fee), I also saw a VTB daughter - I didn‚Äôt check it.  There are, like wm exchangers.  Well, Unistream. <br><br>  Fifth - Navigation is not in Yandex maps, or in Google maps does not work.  Google issues street names in Greek, in Yandex there are no streets at all, so you‚Äôll take a car, better with a local navigator.  By the way, you can rent a car from a big company via the Internet.  Without a car in Cyprus is sad, public transport is not very developed here.  With the car, right-hand drive, is another matter, especially if you have someone to drive.  Hint - a glass of wine before driving is allowed. <br>  UPD: Advise IGO.  I'll try to try. <br><br>  Sixth - Firms.  To open a company and combine business with pleasure is easy and inexpensive.  Opening a company on the spot - 475 euros + 200 euros to a nominal director, <a href="http://www.fbscyprus.com/">for example</a> , in Russia, the Cyprus offshore company will sell you for 1,500 euros.  An account in a Cyprus bank, with a personal presence, will be opened for free, in Russia it is another 200-300 euros.  Given that a week-long single trip in the off-season costs 250 euros, a visa is given without problems, only 4 hours to fly.  Alas, the Cyprus offshore is subject to 15% VAT on residents of the European Union + 10% of the profits, must report annually.  But the two directors of an international company and their families can (with money and hemorrhoids) get a residence permit - and I really want to stay there. <br><br>  UPD: I was reminded that there is free wifi on the embankment, plus CYTA distributed to the population a cloud of routers with WEP encryption and a default password calculated at a time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118639/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118639/</a></p>
