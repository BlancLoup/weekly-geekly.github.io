  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first step to the rubber woman</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>A post about young people, beer and how I stopped using it is no more and no less.</i>  <i>If you do not drink - read, I think it makes no sense.</i> <br><br>  So it is almost accepted, young people are going, talking and if there is not a reason for ‚Äúsomething stronger‚Äù, - beer is drinking.  From the age of 14 I have been doing this regularly with my friends  Once, we were ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù and it was ‚Äúcool‚Äù)) I remember the time when beer was still very bitter and gave up with alcohol, with age it became ‚Äúeasier‚Äù and ‚Äútastier‚Äù, we almost stopped drinking from it, but by still carried some kind of lightness and ease in collective communication. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It so happened that I was unwell and the good doctors showered me with antibiotics, advising me not to drink alcohol in the coming month, they said it was very harmful for the nervous system (that is, for the brain).  Well, what's there for a month :) <br>  Later I began to notice that in the company I was no longer so merry, my friends wondered why I was so lost, they chatted, they laugh, they drink beer, but I‚Äôm not in the subject. <br><br>  What's the matter?  Nobody gets drunk from one bottle of beer, everyone behaves the same way, why does his absence change the level of communication in such a way?  Just some kind of cult.  It's really just a cult, people are <i>united by a joint action</i> , nothing more.  Further, it forms a habit, and beer tummies appear, beer alcoholics, and sometimes not only beer.

      Of course, I have not opened America to anyone now, you know all this, only for some reason few people use it. <br><br>  Began to drink non-alcoholic beer in the company.  Surprisingly bad young people treat non-alcoholic beer, the argument is one "The first step to ..." well, then you heard, broke the cult. <br>  Happening: <br>  - give a sip, throat dries. <br>  - nya. <br>  - what non-alcoholic?  then do not. <br>  Funny  Yes, for me. <br><br>  For a month I drank non-alcoholic beer, hid it in a bag and was "in the subject."  I even got drunk.  Later I switched to kvass - it is tastier, and you can drink it in liters as well as beer and not get bored!  The result was surprised, just joint drinking of tea, beer, coffee, kvass really really unites. <br><br>  <u>The most important result:</u> <br><ul><li>  I began to consume less alcoholic beverages.  Drunkenness from beer now seems to be rather a side effect, and its trick is only in the specificity of taste and association.  I drink only on holidays, usually strong drinks. </li><li>  Communication with friends has only become better, I support the cult, apparently this is enough, often no one notices that I have kvass. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>I urge everyone to give up this disastrous affair, and KVASit together without harming their health.</b> <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Beer has become an integral attribute of friendly communication in certain, very large circles, it should be noted.  I did not stop drinking it at all, just much less frequently.  in the process of companionship (almost every day) I drink kvass.  What I advise you. <br><br>  This is my first post on Habr√©.  I would be grateful for comments in the comments, that where not so. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44019/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44019/</a></p>
